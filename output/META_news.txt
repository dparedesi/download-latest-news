An upcoming trade war and more DOGE job cuts will hammer the US economy, economists warn. The first major set of economic reports last week reflect the state of the United States economy during President Donald Trump’s first full month in office. The data reveal a spike in layoffs and slower hiring growth across both the public and private sectors, with looming cuts suggesting larger economic woes in the months ahead. The US economy added 151,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department report, which came out on Friday – well short of economist expectations showing a stall in economic growth. Approximately 7.1 million Americans are currently receiving unemployment benefits compared with 6.5 million this time last year. “I think the real risk here is that if Trump doesn’t reverse course on what he’s doing, it could be his last boring report, which I think would be really damaging to the economy. If you look under the hood, I think we are starting to see pretty foreboding cracks,” Elizabeth Pancotti, the managing director of policy and advocacy at the economic think tank Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. The White House painted an alternative picture. “In one month under President Trump, the American economy is soaring back to greatness after the economic calamity left by Joe Biden,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Former President Biden, however, was lauded as leading the best economic recovery in the world following the global economic downturn amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that last week’s numbers are probably the best we will get in a while amid looming layoffs and tariff fears. “This is the calm before the storm, before we start to see the fallout in the job market from the trade war and the DOGE cuts, and other economic policies from Trump,” Zandi told Al Jazeera. DOGE is the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by ardent Trump supporter, billionaire Elon Musk. Those concerns, coming on the back of comments that Trump made over the weekend declining to rule out an impending US recession, reverberated through the stock market on Monday when the S&P 500 lost 155.21 points, or 2.69 percent, to end the day at 5,614.99 points. This is the first time it finished below its 200-day moving average – a closely watched support level – since November 2023. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 726.01 points, or 3.99 percent, to 17,470.21 – its biggest single-day decline since September 2022, according to CNN. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 890.63 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.09. There are key indicators that point to this getting worse in the months to come. The index which shows how many people took on part-time work including because they were unable to find full-time work or have had their hours reduced, increased by 460,000 from the month prior, to 4.9 million people. “This is the shortest honeymoon period we’ve ever seen if you are 50 days on the job. He inherited on paper a pretty stable, pretty solid economy and it is already deteriorating after 50 days. I don’t think that that’s ever happened,” Pancotti added. Since Trump took office, DOGE has cut almost 33,000 people across the federal government, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks federal government and tech sector layoffs. Because of ongoing court cases, the official count from the Labor Department is 10,000 jobs. The layoffs include employees at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Park Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Energy, among many other government agencies. The number of public sector cuts is expected to increase as many of the recent DOGE cuts came after the end of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (a division of the Labor Department) reporting period for the month closed. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration announced its plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The president has also called for the dissolution of the Department of Education, even though that can only be done by an act of Congress. The global investment firm Apollo forecasts that when considering federal contractors on top of full-time employees, the federal workforce cuts could account for close to 1 million jobs lost. In last week’s jobs report from the Labor Department, the biggest gains were in the healthcare sector, which added 52,000 jobs. However, looming healthcare cuts could make those gains very short-lived. “If we’re looking at massive Medicaid cuts – we’re already seeing [National Institutes of Health] NIH and health research cuts – Medicare cuts are on the table. All of those really could threaten the sector that is driving a lot of those job gains,” Pancotti continued. The downstream effect has already hit the private sector, which relies on federal funds. A private sector worker in Texas, who spoke to Al Jazeera under the condition of anonymity, said that the company they worked with had clients who were largely dependent on federal funds because of which business had dried up. “We went from having a very busy-looking Q1 of 2025 to having absolutely nothing on the books within about a week of the inauguration,” the source told Al Jazeera. “Now that I am having to not spend any money whatsoever and do nothing but look for jobs, I’m not spending money in the economy. I’m not doing things like making improvements to my house. I would have paid contractors to do that. I’m within a couple of months of paying off the last of my student loans and now those are going to be paused until I find something new. Now, I have to worry if I can make the necessary trip to take my cat to the vet,” the source added. According to data from the Commerce Department, US consumers have cut back on spending for the first time in nearly two years. Others are worried about how they’re going to get by, like Kathlyn Clore who worked in audience engagement at The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a nonprofit that received funding from USAID, until she was recently laid off. A single mom in Hawaii – one of the single most expensive states where the average home price is well over $800,000 – Clore has two kids. “I’m on my own supporting my two kids. It’s just going to make that a lot more difficult to make it through this uncertainty,” Clore told Al Jazeera. “I keep wondering if Donald really thinks about what he’s doing to normal, middle-class people like me who are just trying to make a living and provide for their kids. Why does he want to make my life so much more difficult?” she added. Trump said on Friday: “We’re trying to shrink the government and grow the private sector. That’s what we’ve been doing.” But layoffs in the private sector are also on the rise. The ADP, which tracks non-farm private payrolls added to the US economy over the previous month, showed the economy added 77,000 jobs, which is well short of the 148,000 economists otherwise expected. The leisure and hospitality sector, a notoriously low-paying set of industries, led the gains, adding 41,000 of those jobs. “Policy uncertainty and a slowdown in consumer spending might have led to layoffs or a slowdown in hiring last month,” Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. A separate report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which helps redundant employees find new employment, showed that in February alone, US employers announced job cuts of more than 172,000 – a 245 percent increase from this time last month – the highest jump since July 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. The jump in cuts showed the biggest annual increase since the height of the recession in February 2009. The retail sector led the cuts with a 572 percent increase in cuts across the industry compared with this time last year. The tech sector saw a wave of high-profile layoffs, continuing a theme that began last year. In 2024, the tech industry cut more than 157,000 jobs. Among those who made cuts in the last month include Meta – Facebook and Instagram’s parent company – which laid off 3,600 employees. The news comes only weeks after its CEO donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Only weeks later, Aerospace giant Blue Origin, which Bezos runs, laid off 1,400 people. Alphabet – Google’s parent company – laid off roughly 100 people in February. It also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. CEOs of all of those companies attended Trump’s inauguration. Microsoft cut roughly 2,000 people from its workforce. Its CEO met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in January, only days before the inauguration. Other major companies including oil and gas giant Chevron announced pending layoffs last month. It comes as Chevron’s woes are about to get more substantial. The Trump Administration revoked the Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company’s licence to pump Venezuelan oil. Starbucks and Southwest Airlines also announced cuts in recent weeks. Trump’s economic policies, including his back and forth on tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory tariffs, will hinder the US workforce. Trump delayed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2. This is the second time he put in place tariffs and then quickly pulled back. “The trade war is even doing more damage than those kinds of other economic policy steps that are being taken. It’s creating uncertainty for businesses,” Zandi added. One sector that will be immediately impacted by the tariffs on Canada and Mexico is the automotive industry. Major players in the sector have slammed the president’s plans in recent weeks, including Ford CEO Jim Farley who said that the tariffs would “blow a hole” in the automotive industry. Other major players across the manufacturing sector also expect this to get worse. William Oplinger, CEO of Alcoa, one of the largest US aluminium manufacturers, said last month at a conference that the aluminium tariffs could cost the US economy 100,000 jobs. “It does look increasingly like the president is serious and is going to engage in broad-based tariffs in a persistent way. If he does, I do expect other countries to retaliate more or less in kind, and that full-blown trade war is going to do a lot of damage. And if it actually goes down that path, I do think recession risks later in the year, later this spring and summer, are very high,” Zandi continued. Trump has claimed a handful of economic wins in his first weeks in office, including a larger investment from Honda to build more plants, which would ultimately lead to more manufacturing jobs. However, production would not come online until May 2028 – less than a year before Trump’s term is up. Japanese truck maker Isuzu also announced a new plant in South Carolina, which will employ 700 people. But it will begin operations in 2027. Trump also touted a deal with TSMC – a Taiwanese semiconductor chip manufacturer – for a $100bn investment. Negotiations for a deal began well before Trump took office and under the Biden Administration, which pushed the chip maker to increase its initial $6.6bn investment. In February, the Trump Administration touted Apple’s recent $500bn investment commitment as a result of Trump’s policies. In April 2021, when Biden was president, Apple made a comparable commitment. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for clarification. Follow Al Jazeera English:

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The stakes are high for Tesla

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London while Dan is on parental leave until May. Do you have a bad boss? From the narcissist to the micromanager, experts outlined four types of poor leaders — and shared tips with BI on how to work with each one. In today's big story, with Tesla's stock cut in half, investors want their CEO back. What's on deck Markets: The stock market has a $1 trillion weapon to fight further price declines: stock buybacks. Tech: An Amazon VP who oversaw the company's flagship AI product is leaving. Business: Target's ideological identity crisis is putting its business in peril. But first, Elon Musk seems a little distracted. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The damage is stunning, BI's Matthew Fox writes. Tesla's stock price has plummeted 55% from its mid-December highs, Elon Musk's net worth is down $132 billion this year, and a wave of anti-Tesla vandalism has intensified from graffiti to gunshots and Molotov cocktails; images show the aftermath of a Tesla showroom that was recently shot up after hours. While this has been unfolding, Musk has been in Washington, DC, overseeing DOGE's cost-cutting government overhaul — and Tesla investors aren't thrilled about it. "We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin," one analyst told BI. "It's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else." Musk himself appears to have acknowledged this precarious balancing act. During an interview that aired just yesterday, Musk was asked by Fox Business how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the White House. His response? "With great difficulty." Needless to say, Musk's answer is unlikely to calm investors' nerves. Especially when yesterday alone saw Tesla's stock plunge 15%, its largest single-day drop since 2020. Tesla no longer seems to be part of the so-called Musk trade, with all of its postelection gains now erased. The company's EV sales have been struggling, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. Car sales plummeted in several countries last month, and Wall Street is juggling concerns about Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. Meanwhile, the competition in China is growing stronger. There now may be more riding on Tesla's long-promised cheaper EV, which is supposed to begin production in June at the latest. With Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts told BI the launch was "crucial" and a "necessity." Musk needs to turn more people into Tesla customers. But since he's been in Washington, he's turned some people off the company entirely. An angel investor told BI she's among the cohort of Americans ditching their Teslas over Musk's DOGE initiative. At the same time, "Tesla takedown" protests have sprung up in cities across the US, and some Tesla owners have seen their vehicles vandalized — you can take a closer look here. Meanwhile, one business is booming amid Tesla's woes: An aquarium worker who sells anti-Elon Musk stickers online as a side hustle told BI he had been selling 400 to 500 stickers a day in recent weeks — up from a handful in the past. The stakes are high for the company at the moment, but as Investing.com's Thomas Monteiro told BI: "Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it." 1. The Magnificent 7's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day. All seven tech darlings — Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — slid deeper into the red Monday, dragging the Nasdaq 100 down 3.8% in its biggest decline since October 2022. The amount of market value wiped out in the index exceeded $1 trillion at lows. The S&P 500, fresh off its worst week in six months thanks to tariff-related uncertainty, lost another 2.7%. 2. The stock market's secret weapon to fighting further price declines. As the stock market struggles, Citi analysts noted it could be a great time for companies to buy back their stock at discounted levels — which has historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to engineer stock gains during lean times. The bank is already expecting more repurchase activity, forecasting $1 trillion in 2025, up 11% from the previous year. 3. Nvidia's sliding stock is currently cheaper than when ChatGPT launched — at least by one metric. Following Monday's market wipeout, the chip giant's P/E ratio dropped to 36.4 times, the lowest since 2019, and is down 30% from its intraday record high. 1. The godfather of DOGE. Behind President Trump's first month back in office lies a sweeping political vision set by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, Thiel argued for the end of all government — even democracy — and for tech entrepreneurs to steer the future. From gutting government agencies to putting a stop to diversity, Trump and his followers are now putting Thiel's vision into practice. 2. Zuck's favorite president. Mark Zuckerberg told an employee in 2014 he thought Andrew Jackson was the greatest US president. The Meta CEO said he admired Jackson for his ruthlessness, and being a populist who "got stuff done," former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, wrote in her recently published memoir, "Careless People." 3. The Amazon VP in charge of its flagship AI product is out. Baskar Sridharan, AWS's VP of AI/ML services, is stepping down a year after joining the company following a major reorg, according to people familiar with the matter. Sridharan oversaw the direction and development of AWS's major AI products, including its main horse in the AI race, Bedrock. 1. How Target went from woke to joke. Target can't figure out what it stands for, particularly when it comes to diversity. That's a bad position for a brand with cultural relevancy baked into the business model. The result is a stock price down 30% this year and an unenviable place at the center of America's culture wars. 2. The Washington Post faces another newsroom shake-up. In an effort to sharpen the Post's mission and cater to new readers' evolving habits, executive editor Matt Murray detailed a substantial newsroom reorganization on Monday. The changes, which include several new leadership roles and reorganized teams, come after owner Jeff Bezos overhauled the paper's opinion pages last month. Read the memo Murray sent to WaPo staff. 3. Jamie Dimon knows who the biggest proponent of remote work is. When it comes to RTO, the JPMorgan Chase CEO said it's often the "people in the middle who complain a lot about it." That is, white-collar workers who generally have more freedom when it comes to where they work than frontline workers. Dimon, a longtime advocate for RTO, recently spoke at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he discussed his own bank's plans to go in-person.

Title: Stock market sell-off: Is a US recession ahead?

When Donald Trump was reelected in November, many investors declared the so-called Trump Trade would spur US stocks to new highs. But markets are now spooked by fears the world's largest economy is close to recession. Many investors believed Donald Trump's return to the White House as the United States' president would be a bonanza for the US stock market, which had already hit all-time highs in recent months thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. They argued that the dealmaking, "America First" president would be sensitive to any uncertainty in financial markets caused by his tariff policy and would likely intervene, if necessary, to help stabilize prices. But after weeks of uncertainty about Trump's protectionist measures, on Monday US stocks fell sharply, against the backdrop of fears that the world's largest economy could tip into recession later this year. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, while the Nasdaq toppled 4% — its steepest fall in two-and-a-half years. Tesla plummeted by 15%, while the Magnificent 7 stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla — collectively entered bear market territory. Deutsche Bank noted how these stocks have shed more than 20% of their value since December. Bloomberg reported that the combined wealth of the five billionaires who attended Trump's inauguration has been slashed by $209 billion (€191 billion) since January 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk alone has lost $144 billion. Markets appeared to be reacting to comments made by the president over the weekend, playing down the impact of his on-off tariff threats to Canada, Mexico and other major trading partners. The Republican also appeared dismissive about the impact his negotiating strategy was having on stocks. "There could be a little disruption [to financial markets]," Trump told Fox News on Sunday. "What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market." "President Trump seems to have abandoned the US stock market and is willing to put his political vision above the near-term outlook for the US economy," Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, wrote in a research note Monday, following the market rout. Citi, meanwhile, downgraded US stocks to "neutral" from "overweight" after the market closed, warning that the investment bank now thinks US growth momentum will "undershoot" the rest of the world. British banking giant HSBC also cut US equities to neutral for the next three to six months, saying the lender sees "better opportunities elsewhere for now." US policymakers have spent the past year trying to avoid plunging the economy into recession. Interest rates have fallen from their recent peak of 5.33%, which helped reduce inflation from its recent multi-decade highs. But Trump's various tariff policies threaten to disrupt efforts to achieve a soft landing. New 25% levies on all steel and aluminum imports into the US are due to take effect Wednesday, while new tariffs on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that: "The prospect of a recession in the US is lurking, with consumer confidence falling, companies facing increasing trade complexity and investors turning more nervous." In addition, the vast public sector cuts led by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk also threaten to weaken growth, as they will take jobs and investment out of the economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week a period of "natural adjustment" as the US moved from higher spending by the public to the private sector. "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We’ve become addicted to this government spending, and there’s going to be a detox period," Bessent told CNBC Friday, adding that a "one-time price adjustment" was to be expected from Trump's tariff policy. Also looming over the US economy is the threat of a partial shutdown of the federal government, if new funding can't be finalized before a Friday deadline. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives is due to vote Tuesday on legislation that would keep the government fully financed. The last government shutdown stretched over 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first term. Goldman Sachs cut its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy to just 1.7%, down from 2.4%. The US investment bank also raised its inflation forecast to 3% from a prior call in the mid-2% range. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Goldman analyst Jan Hatzius wrote. In the meantime, the Trump administration insists that a new round of tax cuts and revenues from tariffs on imports will help boost the economy. White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human workâand none of these estimates include the cost of human laborâbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic âblitzscalingâ: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, itâs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, âThatâs nothing.â) Weâve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little thatâs concrete about OpenAIâs finances, everything weâve seen suggests that theyâre far from profitable2âa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAIâs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the USâs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I donât want to rush to the conclusion that it isnât necessary or advisable. But thatâs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. Thatâs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. Itâs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaireâs toy for achieving science fictionâs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work thatâs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of theseâand other cloud providersâare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we donât know how to answer yetâand probably wonât until weâre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although itâs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollarsâand possibly much lessâthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure thatâs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure thatâs needed will allow us to build a future thatâs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruptionâno doubt disruption thatâs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but thatâs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that weâll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencionâs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of âgarage AIâ startups, startups that arenât dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and âengagementââa process that, weâve seen, inevitably results in enshittificationâwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AIâs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining âalready hereâ¦just not unevenly distributed yet.â The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does ârelentlessly pro-humanâ mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of âgeneral intelligence.â Iâve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence isâthey’ve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isnât a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isnât a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedolâupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesnât fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machinesâat least in 2025âis that humans can want to do something. Machines canât. AlphaGo doesnât want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesnât want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; thatâs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, âI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.â You may not want to be there, but thatâs where creation startsâand creation is the reward. Thatâs why Iâm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, âItâs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people donât enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.â Donât get me wrongâSunoâs product is impressive, and Iâm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people donât enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didnât want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldnât have to say, âDonât quit the day job,â or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poetsâany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a âmoatâ that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. Weâre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for ârelentlessly pro-humanâ AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesnât matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what ârelentlessly humanâ might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isnât the lines of code that they produce; itâs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We wonât have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they wonât want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solveâthatâs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, weâre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is âslouching towards Bethlehemâ? We donât know, but there are some conclusions that we canât avoid: While there are many challenges to overcomeâlatency being the greatest of themâsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get ârelentlessly humanâ applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? Weâre about to find out.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

Title: AI reveals which reading method is best

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice Here's the starting point for this article. For almost 100 years the Education Establishment has maneuvered, plotted, and schemed to eliminate phonics, and to make American children memorize sight-words. The pitch has always been sweeping: phonics can’t possibly work for a complex language like English, and sight-words are the only way to go. Teachers, students, and parents have been bullied relentlessly to embrace what phonics experts (such as Rudolf Flesch) assume is a fraud and a nonstarter. How does the ordinary citizen deal with this? Well, it's been rough because the professors at Harvard, etc. do not play games. They're trying, in my opinion, to dumb down the country in order to conquer it. They're not going to let you get in the way. In short, we have a perfect situation for testing what AI can do for us. A lot of people have the feeling that AI is like a Magic 8 Ball or Ouija board. Some profound truth is brought to us from the Great Beyond. Sorry, that's a false impression. AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

Free Republic Browse · Search Bloggers & Personal Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson A lot of people have the feeling that AI is like a Magic 8 Ball or Ouija board. Some profound truth is brought to us from the Great Beyond. Sorry, that's a false impression. AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Click here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic, LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno, CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.

In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war.

It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words.

It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?). Of course, when a person has true fluency of reading, it’s all by sight. 6 posted on 03/10/2025 5:10:26 PM PDT by Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!)

As as consequence, I went years without misspelling words in English. It was helpful later in Spanish, German, Welsh, Italian and Turkish. I've had a little more difficultly with Irish and Scot's Gaelic since I don't have all the "rules" committed to memory for phonics in those two languages. There are nuances in French to blend trailing consonants and leading vowels. Another body of knowledge to learn.Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. 14 posted on 03/10/2025 10:00:23 PM PDT by Myrddin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them.

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks slump as recession risks weigh on investors
URL: https://www.thestar.com.my/news/world/2025/03/11/roundup-us-stocks-slump-as-recession-risks-weigh-on-investors
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:22:00Z
Full Content:
Tuesday, 11 Mar 2025 by Benny Xie NEW YORK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks plunged on Monday as investors grappled with mounting concerns over the health of U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 890.01 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.71. The S&P 500 dropped 155.63 points, or 2.69 percent, closing at 5,614.56, while the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 727.90 points, or 4.00 percent, to 17,468.33, its worst day since 2022. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, with technology and consumer discretionary suffering the steepest declines, falling 4.34 percent and 3.90 percent respectively. In contrast, utilities and energy managed to post modest gains of 1.04 percent and 0.95 percent. Investor unease was fueled by the recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who acknowledged the possibility of a rough economic patch ahead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Friday that the economy might experience a "detox period" as the new administration implements government spending cuts. During a Fox News interview aired on Sunday, Trump described the economic situation as a "period of transition" when asked about the potential for a recession. "What I have to do is build a strong country," Trump said. "You can't really watch the stock market." These remarks, coupled with escalating trade tensions -- highlighted by ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- have rattled market participants. The technology-heavy Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022, as major players like Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta each fell over 4 percent, with Tesla plunging 15.43 percent. Amid these developments, the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since December, reflecting a widespread move away from risk. "This is the first time we've had an administration pretty much say with a straight face... the objectives are going to cause pain," said Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. The S&P 500 has now erased all the gains it made since Election Day in early November last year. The Nasdaq has been hit even harder, as a rally in big tech stocks driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence reversed course. "There's just no support in the tech stocks right now," said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. Analysts are increasingly worried that the U.S. economy may face a prolonged period of sluggish growth. In a research note, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius revised his 2025 GDP forecast downward to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent while raising his projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3 percent -- up from prior estimates in the mid-2 percent range. These updated forecasts mark the first time in roughly two and a half years that U.S. GDP growth is expected to fall below consensus data, which currently anticipates above 2 percent growth. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Hatzius wrote. "Our near-term view is that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer," he added. Investors continued to seek safe-haven assets, driving demand for bonds and pushing the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down to 4.22 percent, as bond prices and yields move inversely. The simultaneous decline in stocks and interest rates is often viewed as a sign of growing economic uncertainty. Adding to the cautious sentiment, oil prices also dropped, reflecting broader concerns about the economy's outlook. Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson cautioned that U.S. stocks could decline another 5 percent as worries mount over the impact of tariffs on corporate earnings and the effects of reduced fiscal spending. The strategist warned the benchmark could sink 20 percent in the likelihood of a recession. "We are not there, but things can change quickly and so it's useful to know the downside in the bear case to manage one's risk," Wilson said. As market sentiment is fragile, investors continue to weigh Trump's mixed signals on tariffs and recession warnings against the backdrop of tightening trade policies and evolving monetary policy expectations. The coming weeks will be critical, with the February consumer price index scheduled for release on Wednesday and the producer price index set to follow on Thursday. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Bubble is Bursting
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/the-bubble-is-bursting/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:01:37Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMarch 10, 2025 In 2000, Sun Microsystems was one of the hottest stocks in the world. Sun seemed to have everything going for it. They were a leader in computer hardware, and offered cutting-edge software solutions. They were an integral part of the fast-growing internet ecosystem. Shares soared from $5 to $64 at the peak in 2000. The company’s market cap reached $200 billion, and the price/sales ratio reached 10x (price/sales is the ratio between a company’s market cap and its revenue – higher means more expensive). By 2002, Sun Microsystems shares had crashed 90%. That year CEO Scott McNealy penned a famous letter titled “Dear Mr. Shareholder”. In it, McNealy chastised investors for running Sun’s stock price up to such ridiculous levels. Specifically, he singled out the 10x price/sales number, and explained exactly what such a valuation implies: At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking? Eventually Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle for $9.40 per share. That’s down 85% from its 2000 high. As of the end of 2024, the S&P Information Technology index traded at a 9.9x price/sales ratio. Take a look at this chart: Source: Hussman Funds After the recent pullback, the index is probably trading at “only” 8x or 9x sales. The point remains the same. The market is wildly overvalued, especially tech. There are outliers like Palantir (PLTR), which trades at an eye-popping 69x price/sales ratio, even after its recent fall. That’s almost 7x higher than Sun Microsystems at its 2000 peak. Palantir is a solid company, but it’s one of the most overpriced stocks I’ve ever seen. In late January, Jim Rickards penned an article for us titled “A U.S. Recession is Coming”. In it, he laid out the case quite clearly. Markets are at or near all-time highs based on every available metric: P/E ratios, the CAPE ratio, market cap/GDP ratio, concentration risk, etc. This stock market bubble is amplified by indexing, investor complacency and analyst euphoria. When such conditions have existed in the past, they have always been followed by market crashes of 50% to 90% unfolding over several years. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (1929), the Nikkei (1989), NASDAQ (2000), and the S&P 500 Index (2008). We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or other unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. And now the bubble falters. As I write this at 11:00 am on Monday March 10th, the Nasdaq is down 3.6% on the day. If the bubble is popping, it’s still early in that process. As Jim noted above, major crashes involve 50-90% downturns. Right now the Nasdaq is only down about 14%. It could have a lot farther to fall. The hottest stocks typically fall the hardest. Think NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla. They are all fundamentally sound companies, but they trade at crazy prices. Just like Sun Microsystems in 2000, today’s tech valuations are utterly unsustainable. Bubbles can be fantastic money-making opportunities. But it looks like this one is drawing to a close. So if you’re still sitting on major tech gains (or losses), it might still be a good idea to take some off the table. Sure, there’s a chance that the market turns around and soars to new highs. But at this point, that looks highly unlikely. As I explained in The Pain Begins, it appears that Trump has decided to accept short-term market pain for long-term economic gains. We can’t look to Trump to save the market. He’s fully focused on saving the real economy. The market looks to be headed significantly lower. This week we’ll review strategies to navigate this new era.

Title: APP Stockholders: Robbins LLP Reminds Investors that a Class Action was filed Against AppLovin Corporation

March 10, 2025 14:53 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

CoinGlass data reveals that just over $535 million in long positions and $176 million in shorts have been wound up in the past day, with Bitcoin alone witnessing $304 million in liquidations. The total figure of $712 million represents an 85%% increase in the past 24 hours, with the dramatic uptick in liquidations resulting in a 4% decline in total open interest, to $87 billion. The cascade in liquidations means that Bitcoin is now down by 4% in the past 24 hours and by 11% in a week, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole suffering a 5.5% decline today. And for some analysts, the Bitcoin price descending to $80,000 today runs the risk of further liquidations in the coming days and potentially weeks. “Looking at the current liquidation heat maps, I think if the price were to drop to $80,000 or so on even weaker sentiment, this could trigger more liquidations of long positions, and in turn cause the price to fall further,” says eToro analyst Simon Peters, speaking to Decrypt. Peters also notes that, in the past, we have seen “retracements of 20-35%” in bull markets before a bottom is found and a recovery is set in mention. “$80,000 is a 28% drawdown or retracement from the $109,300 all-time high,” he explains. “If the price were to fall further due to the reasons mentioned above, a 35% drawdown from the all-time high would put the price at $70,000 before any base is potentially formed.” However, Peters also suggests that a recovery to the $84,000-$85,000 region could end up triggering a liquidation of shorts, thereby helping to accelerate a rebound. For some industry figures, one of the reasons why liquidations have been so severe today is that they’ve been driven by retail more than institutions. “Many of the recent liquidations likely stem from inexperienced traders who entered the market during the “extreme greed” phase in December 2024, driven by the so-called ‘Trump-pump,’” says Unity Wallet COO James Toledano, speaking to Decrypt. The declines that set off today’s liquidations likely followed from several fundamental reasons, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a recession amid a growing trade war with other economies. Investors have also been spooked by analysis which shows that the North Korean Bybit hackers have been able to successfully cash out $300 million of their $1.5 billion haul, with the converted funds unlikely to ever be traced or recovered. “Expectations were simply too high, and the market is now paying the price,” says Toledano. “One of the biggest letdowns has been the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which turned out to be nothing more than a repackaging of seized FBI assets—around 200,000 BTC ($16.5 billion), just 1% of Bitcoin’s market cap ($1.65T as of today)—placed under the control of the Federal Reserve.” The poor sentiment is reflected in one particular prediction market on Myriad Markets, which shows that 100% of participants believe that the Fear and Greed Index will not rise to 25% or above today. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) Yet for some observers, the crypto market isn’t sensitive to macroeconomics so much as it’s correlated to US markets, in particular tech stocks. “The biggest factor pushing prices down isn't the Bybit hack or the disappointing Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it's the steep fall in the Nasdaq stock market index, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks—Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla,” says Glen Goodman, a cryptocurrency analyst and author of The Crypto Trader. Goodman tells Decrypt that Bitcoin's price has generally shown a “very strong correlation” with tech sticks, and that whenever tech struggles “investors flee” from crypto. This view is supported by the fact that, according to Toledano, “Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for a fourth consecutive week, totaling $4.5 billion,” a sign that many of the institutions which have probably been invested in tech stocks have also been selling their crypto holdings. Toledano suggests that if sentiment remains fragile, leveraged positions will continue to be at risk, although a flushing out of over-leveraged traders could help prepare the ground for a rebound. “The key indicators to watch are derivatives positioning, spot demand, and institutional flows,” he says. “If risk appetite recovers, BTC could stabilize or even rally, but if fear continues to dominate, further downside is likely.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Notable reports expected this week include: These data points will be closely monitored, as they could influence the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates and shape investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve has been working to tame inflation after it peaked above 9% in 2022. Despite some progress, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. If Wednesday’s CPI data shows continued inflationary pressure, the Fed may consider maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period. A cooling labor market and slowing economic growth add complexity to the Fed’s decision-making. Policymakers must balance curbing inflation without triggering a deep recession. With Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, spending cuts, and stricter immigration policies—shaping future economic conditions, the Fed’s next steps will be closely scrutinized.

Title: Stock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’

Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:07:56Z

The stock market selloff stretched into a new week, with the latest losses heagain tied to comments from President Donald Trump, whose wide-sweeping and oft-changing tariff policies have rattled Wall Street confidence, as early fears of a recession emerge. Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon’s comeback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September. Monday was be the Nasdaq’s worst daily decline since September 2022. Driving Monday’s pullback was Trump’s interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic “transition” and cautioned “you can’t really watch the stock market.” Trump’s comments are “weighing on sentiment” and “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients. Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week. Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety. 20%. That’s about how much the “magnificent seven” group of big American tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg. The recent decline coincided with Trump’s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump’s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. “The reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,” explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies. Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday’s roughly 5,610. Trump’s policies will be “sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before” lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies “benefit the market later in the year,” said Wilson. “This is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in emailed comments. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What is Alphabet Inc.?
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Alphabet-Inc
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:07:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Incorporated (also known as Alphabet Inc. or simply Alphabet) is a conglomerate of numerous companies, including the search engine giant Google. In 2015, Alphabet became Google's holding company. As of 2025, Google, along with many other companies like Fitbit, Waymo and Mandiant, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Alphabet Inc. on Oct. 2, 2015. They announced their intentions to create a new holding company in August 2015. Alphabet was the result of its wish to strategically restructure the original company to make it cleaner, leaner, and more accountable to its investors and customers. With this change, Alphabet replaced Google Inc. as a publicly traded entity. Alphabet also became the parent company for many other businesses that originally fell under the Google Inc. umbrella and for other companies acquired after the 2015 split. The company is incorporated in Delaware; its headquarters are at Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. According to Larry Page's open letter on the Alphabet Investor Relations page, it says he and Brin chose the name "Alphabet" because the word means "a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search." Page also said they favored the name because it breaks down into alpha-bet. In a financial context, alpha means investment return above benchmark, which is what the company has always strived for, according to Page. As part of the transition from Google Inc. to Alphabet, all Google shares were transferred to Alphabet stock on a share-for-share basis, with the former automatically converting into the same number of shares of the latter, with all the same rights. Alphabet trades on the Nasdaq composite under Google's former ticker symbols, GOOG and GOOGL. These symbols represent two types of shares. GOOGL shares are Class A shares or common stock. These shares confer ownership stake and voting rights on stockholders. GOOG shares are Class C shares that confer no voting rights on holders. By issuing Class C shares, Brin and Page were able to preserve their control while also positioning the firm to take advantage of liquidity in the public market. During a five-year period between December 2018 and December 2023, Alphabet's net income increased by 23% and its revenue by 18.%. Its gross margin also increased by 61%, and cash flow rose 25%. Between March 2024 and January 2025, the share price fluctuated between $131 and $206. Toward the end of January 2025, GOOG shares were trading on Nasdaq composite at over $200. Alphabet offers a broad range of digital products and services. Its most famous product is the Google search engine, which was launched in 1999 and occupies the largest market share as of January 2025. Some other popular products from Alphabet under the Google umbrella include the following: Besides these consumer products, Google's product suite also includes products for business use: Other well-known Google products include Google Cloud, a cloud computing platform that allows users to access numerous services over the cloud, and the Google Workspace suite of cloud-based productivity apps. In recent years, Google has scaled up efforts to develop its AI capabilities and product suite. This has yielded products such as the following: Alphabet's offerings also span products and services such as the following: These products are independently developed and marketed by Alphabet's many other (non-Google) subsidiaries. Between 2015 and 2025, Alphabet acquired more than 150 companies, many of which occurred after the first few years of its inception. Notable acquisitions for Alphabet include the following: The wide range of acquisitions highlights Alphabet's willingness to look beyond its Google search roots and, as Page said in his investor letter of 2015, to contain "the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products" within Alphabet. Despite Alphabet's expansion, Google remains one of its largest subsidiaries. In addition to the original search engine and digital advertising businesses, Google maintains control over many of its other profitable legacy businesses for Alphabet, including YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail and Google Cloud. Other offshoots of the former company including GV (formerly Google Ventures); CapitalG (formerly Google Capital); X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X); and Google Nest (formerly Nest Labs) are also Alphabet subsidiaries. These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

Do you wanna do full range? -Just the elbow motion. -Do you wanna squeeze at the top? -Amplitude… -Eh, you know… If we could do this, like, outside my apartment 5 minutes away at a cafe – sure! Do I swing my sword around like this? Or do I do like… -What are the first 3 supplements that you would recommend the average intermediate trainee to look at. Or formulated otherwise, what are the 3 supplements that you recommend the most often? -Man, that’s tough because I’m now sponsored by a new company that has “the ultimate 6 supplements”. They explicitly told me never ever mention 1 without mentioning the other 5. So I’m actually contractually obligated not to answer this question. Is there another question I can answer? -Right. Go with creatine then. -So this is just creatine 123. Yeah. So I think it depends on how we talk about supplements, because I typically don’t talk about multivitamins as a supplement, even though it is. It’s not something they considered like for health and fitness. And I think it’s like way more for health than it is for fitness. It’s not going to get you more jacked. But I think that if you’re serious enough to be taking supplements, I think that you should consider multivitamin, multimineral in any of the many, many ways that you can take such a thing, including some of the better kind of greens, powders type situations. I think sometimes they have some merit to more or less just round out your intake of micronutrients to make sure that, like, you’re not just missing like entire swathes of, you know, the D vitamins or something, which can make a difference. And so I would say like some, you know, counter consideration can be made for multivitamin multimineral. Though the, the literature on that is not super clear. And there are lots of caveats and contextual things. Creatine is hugely in consideration at the top three. It’s probably one of the most empirically well-supported supplements. It’s empirically supported and also supported in a few different ways that are worth mentioning. One way it’s supported is, it’s just direct scientific investigations show that it almost always works to gain muscle and strength. It’s also, very, very importantly, well understood in the, in the trenches, so to speak, in the fitness world, to be like something that actually works. You know, there’s a few things that have a good empirical support, but the effect magnitude is so small that nobody really uses it. And people who tried it, they’re like, I don’t know if it does anything. Creatine does stuff, which is sweet. It’s also the physiological rationale, the chemical rationale makes perfect sense. And, all those aligning is a pretty damn good. And also creatine is like a few interesting potential cognitive benefits and health benefits, which is at some point creating kind of seems like essential almost to take if you want to optimize and so creatine is good. And, you know, slot number 3 would be kind of a mix and match of what sorts of challenges are you running into in your life? If you are in a situation where you find the literature on intro workout, post-workout nutrition compelling, and worth your time, and then you have everything else sorted in your nutrition, I would say getting a high quality whey or whey like protein with a rapidly digesting carbohydrate, like Powerade or Gatorade powder or something, consuming that during and after your workout might be something that makes it things go better, especially if you’re workouts are very hard or very long. And if you can throw some electrolytes in there, then, if your workouts have you sweating a lot and stuff, then that can really quite, make a decent impact. Very marginal effect in total, but it’s one of those things, like… it makes such good theoretical sense and experientially so many people who have tried it they’re like: “The last half an hour of my workout just goes way better if I do this.” then great. It also sets you up for if you finish your whey protein, your carbs after training, you have time to shower, you have time to drive without needing to be paranoid about instantly, you know, guzzling down as much protein as possible. So that can be quite nice and convenient. It’s also very, has a very good price performance. A lot of people will illusorily say, I’m sure you get this all the time, like, I can’t afford supplements. Like you understand, whey protein is cheaper than meat in almost every context. So… and higher quality. So… it’s just very, very difficult to say it’s bad. But if you’re a person who struggles to get daily protein in, up to high enough levels, then I would say yes, whey protein is a consideration for supplementation, but also so is casein protein. And so it’s like egg protein. And a variety of vegan proteins can do a great job like soy protein if you are a vegan. And so just any kind of protein supplement to get you up to your daily standard of multiple meals throughout the day, roughly even protein, I think, is a really excellent thing. Is it technically a supplement? Oh, yeah, we can argue all day. It’s really kind of just a food. But I think so. Basically. If you’re not taking some kind of multivitamin-multimineral, if your diet is a very well rounded, you don’t have to and then you’re totally good. If you’re not taking creatine and if you’re not taking some kind of protein on an as needed basis, then, I would say though, those are probably the first supplements to look at. A couple of… can I talk about some ones that didn’t make the list? -Sure. Yeah. -Yeah, like… So, you know, if you need energy and focus and stuff, I think caffeine based stimulant product pre-workout can have an utility function that’s positive for you. Not everyone needs that sort of thing. I don’t. A lot of people think, like, you know, they train at 6 p.m., and so, like, it’s just intractable because they would just never fall asleep or the sleep quality sucks, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. And there are, you know, a few other supplements that have kind of sort of contextual situation. Sometimes literature on omega 3 looks pretty good, sometimes it doesn’t look so good. Generally it’s fine, so maybe that’s something to consider, a healthy fat supplement. But, you know, I think those are probably in the conversation for me for things to consider. And the last thing I’ll say is, you know, outside of creatine just probably being better to take than not to take and making sure that, you know, your vitamin mineral levels are good. And if not, feel free to supplement. There are ways to just never have to eat supplements and get all the protein you need. And after that all of the supplements that you could take that really make a difference, at least today, don’t have a lot of convincing evidence that you even need to take them. And so it’s kind of, a thing where I think a lot of people get to the intermediate stage and think, okay, like time for supplements. And they open the door metaphorically to supplements, and that room is like, like one dustbin falls over and a spider crawls across the floor… The fuck? It’s nothing in here, really. Creatine is in there by itself. Like “I thought you’d never come rescue me.” And so, you know, like, it’s just, supplements just aren’t that big of a deal to begin with. So I just want to make sure people get that information. Because I think a lot of people, you tell them, like “When you’re in intermediate, man, get creatine, and protein will jack you up…” and then… is just not true that these make such a huge effect that you even need to be taking them. -Yeah, it’s one of the things where people micromanage the most about the things that actually matter the least… probably. And I would agree that most of the supplements that I recommend to clients or people, there are things that you could get from your diet, but people don’t, whether that’s magnesium or vitamin D, vitamin D you can also get from the sun not so much diet in the first place. And then there’s creatine, basically… Do you put any stock in anything beyond creatine or that you wouldn’t get from your diet like citrulline, beta-alanine? -So beta-alanine is a fun supplement. I don’t like how it makes my skin feel. It’s not. A lot of people think that feels nice. I hate it. -The tingling… -Yes. Is it just not convincing to me that it causes muscle growth and since muscle growth is kind of the only thing I optimize on, if I was interested in sport performance maximally, I would probably have phases of beta-alanine administration because it is quite a decent buffer and it can let you get a few more reps or a few more steps or a few more rolls. -Not for jiu jitsu? -So, I don’t optimize for jiu jitsu. If I was, I’d may very well take it. And, so that’s a fun supplement, Citrulline malate, it does some things, but, it just hasn’t stood the test of time in a way that we can say, like, this is for sure the things it does, and they’re really good and they’re really meaningful. I wanted, you know, in the 2010 citrulline was something that everyone was looking at very closely at, and it just kind of was like, you know, like it’s like your friend goes on a couple dates with a guy and she’s like “I think he’s great.” And a couple weeks later, like, “How’s Frank?” She’s like “.%##&% Frank…”, you know… And you’re like: “Oh shit, you know, it’s just some guy.” So citrulline, it just doesn’t seem to have that kind of real raw, like, wow effect magnitude that makes it malleable for me. -Yeah. What you very often seen with supplements and especially with citrulline is that people get very excited about a proxy for the results that they’re looking for. So citrulline makes you do more reps and then they’re like, more gains. But actually there’s no study finding statistically significantly greater muscle growth with citrulline supplementation than without it. Now, the supplements… the research is a little bit limited, but with supplements I think the bar can be pretty high because there’s so much stuff that goes on. So many publication bias, false positives… So if there’s not very compelling research showing it actually does improve the outcome that you’re looking for, like muscle growth, I think it’s indeed very fair to say you can have a very skeptical outlook towards that something. -Yeah. And it doesn’t mean a cynical outlook because you can say… look like, five studies later, we might all be taking citrulline malate. Five very good studies, replicated by different labs… But for now, there’s no doubt, I think like, from a kind of grander perspective on truth value, there are probably at least a few supplements currently in use and sold somewhere in small health food stores that are actually bangers, like they fuck and they work. We just don’t have the research volume to say for sure. And because humans have limited money, and the number of supplements you can buy is actually so… kind of unlimited. Like there are hundreds of them. And they each cost $20-$60 per month. Man. You know, you just don’t want to take them all. If you’re Brian Johnson, then you’re, you know, trillionaire or whatever, you can take all of them. But he’s really systematic, too, about taking a lot of supplements for a long time, trying to figure out which ones work, which ones don’t. And then he, like, puts a bunch of them away after another. Yep. That didn’t work. That didn’t work. If you want to do something like that, that’s cool. The ROI on that for him is awesome, for you and me and everyone else is going to be a gigantic fucking waste of time. Better he does it and we find out what works by him. But yeah, no doubt there there are supplements because what I don’t want people to get the perception of. And I used to commit this fallacy all the time is the like “Keep it simple stupid” fallacy. You know, can you imagine, like, telling someone who works at a video who designed a GPU cores to keep it simple? He’s like, get out of my face. You have no idea how complicated this is. The human body is quite complex, and there are no doubt supplements out there that absolutely work, we just don’t know about in a real confirmatory way. And so in the future, we have to be open minded that some supplements really do work, because a lot of people get this idea when we speak that, oh, just like 2 or 3 things that work, everything else doesn’t work. It’s like, no, that doesn’t work. It’s some of them don’t work because we’ve studied like, you know, ten times and it just comes up zero every time – probably doesn’t work. But a lot of them were just like, I’m just… I’m just not sure if they work, you know. And so because they cost money, you know… A very terrible analogy I always give is like, would you drive three hours one way and three hours back to, like, hook up with a hook up buddy who, like, just does it every time, like, she’s got it like, yeah, maybe. Right? But if it was like, hey, would you drive three hours for someone that may or may not even show up to the date? You’re like, man, three hours, bro… You know, if you could do this, like outside my apartment five minutes away at a cafe, sure. But like three hours, no. That cost, you know, if someone was willing to ship you free supplements every month and try new supplements all the time, I’d say yes. Try them all. You know, not gonna kill you. But because they cost money and because you put your hopes and dreams into them working I would say for the most part, stick to the ones that probably work. -Speaking of things that actually work, what do you think… What do you think the things are that really move the needle the most for an intermediate level trainee? So they’re doing the basics. You know, they’re doing strength training. They are consuming enough protein. They’re tracking the macros. They have a at least some decent volume of training and decent effort. They got their newbie gains and then they get kind of stuck. What do you think are the things that, for those types of individuals, have the most effect, things they could do, like invest more time in to get better gains? -One is… …so the intermediates, right? They’re early intermediates or late intermediates? -Let’s say early intermediates. -So it’s a… try to analyze whether or not you are pushing yourself hard in the gym on an objective standard. -How do you know that? -So you set yourself a goal of getting roughly 3 RIR in the first week of your mesocycle, and you write down all your sets and reps, and then every single week after until you have to deload you make it your fucking mission as a grown adult to match or exceed every single… exceed every time. So if it’s the same weight, one more rep every set, if it’s, a little bit more weight, same reps. Don’t let your reps fall until you hit failure, and not failure like you gave up. Failure like somebody is there to make sure you don’t die and really learn what that feels like. You may just be training either exactly as hard as you thought and you’re like, okay, that’s not a limiting factor. Great. I can move on to the next thing, or you will be like, oh yeah, I can try harder because a lot of people will do independent RIR estimates, which are totally cool way to train. And that means like every time you come to the gym, whatever you’re RIR is, it doesn’t matter if it’s failure or if it’s 2 RIR, they’ll just sort of organically get to it and every time, independently of what happened last session, independently of the next session. And that’s cool. And if you have, a really hard training drive, it’s an excellent way to train. It’s also very liberating. You just fucking send it, you know, you don’t have to worry about numbers, or anything like that. But if you suspect you might not be training hard enough, which I find that a lot of folks who are intermediates can train harder, than the easiest way to do it, in my opinion, the most straightforward and more systematic is to set yourself a nice, easy goal in the first week and just keep beating it by a little. And at some point it’s going get really tough, and then you’re going to find out how tough is it, because some people will say, oh man, I got ten reps and I couldn’t have gotten 11. But if last week you got 11 and this week it’s just 2.5 more pounds on the bar, you need to get 11, then… …seeing it from that mentality, you might get 11. And then next week you get 11 again. And the week after you’re like, there’s no way I’m going to do it. But you believe in yourself and you get 11 again. Then you find out what really hard training is, and then you find out if it was limiting you or not. Because sometimes hard training like is roughly the same and sometimes hard training is a big, big unlock. So I’d say that’s something worth exploring. Once you’ve done that… So… -Progressive overload, very important. -Yes, yes. -Reps in reserve and testing that you’re actually getting to that desired level of proximity to failure by occasionally going to failure. -Yes. But not, not just going to failure. Trying to meet an objective standard you don’t know if you can meet, but really putting your ego behind it, because what you may think is your failure point is your failure point, but it’s much more psychological and physiological. But if you unlock your psychology to say, I don’t give a fuck what happens, I’m going to go all the way and let’s see if I can get 11 reps and maybe you’ll get 9, And you look like: I really did try absolutely as hard as I could, but whatever. If you think you’re really, really, really, really trying and you’re not making the gains you want, that’s probably not where you’re going to get more, more gains. But if you’ve never objectively put up a standard… Why am I saying this? Personal trainer for a long time, coaching people for a long time, coaching myself for a long time… You’d be really, really surprised in many cases when you put an objective standard to someone’s performance week after week how much their performance elevates, because usually, you know, especially when you’re highly fatigued after a few weeks, you need like, what do you call them? Reactive deload. Your biceps are kind of cooked. You’re like, I deload time. But really, like, you really were three RIR and you know, your girlfriend kind of was bitching at you that week, school kind of got hard, your psychology drained a little bit and you’re like…. And it’s like, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. And I go, well, how many reps were you trying to get? And they’re like, well, I wasn’t trying to get the number of reps, I was just trying to go to failure. Like your mind can trick you, man. Your mind can fucking trick you and can say, oh, this is failure. Like, no, no, no, no, no. Like we don’t have a marathon race or 500 or a 100 meter or a 200 meter race that race isn’t just go really fast until you get tired. Like it’s… the line ends here. You’re expected to go as hard as you can until that line. And so with weights and reps, you just keep extending that line a little bit. Look what you can’t do it. Hey, you know you tried, but there’s always an objective standard you could raise yourself to. And sometimes your body will take you there. And for me personally, like this is really true, especially as you get stronger because like when you’re squatting 400 4 sets of 10 your warm up with 400 for a double. Feels like, dude, I can get 3 and then I fucking break in half. Like there’s no way I can do those. How the hell… And then if it was just a standalone workout, I mean, you might feel your swag a little bit. You might do 400 for a set of 5 next time, pretty hard. You’re gonna… pretty good. Might do a set of 8, then a back off, set of 6. But if you go and look at your notebook and you’re like, last week I did 390 for 3 by 10, I’m gonna do 400 for 3 by fucking 10. I’m going to goddamn try. And then ten, ten, ten and you did it. But like, it took a lot and somehow you got it out of your muscles. Now, you know, you’re training hard and you just don’t have to worry about it anymore if that’s limiting factor. Another thing I would say is an interesting potential unlock for folks of that experience level is to do specialization phases, because you might have gotten away with 5 to 15 working sets per muscle per week, of for all your muscles up to that point, that’s probably the best way to go about it, because you’ll get a huge return on investment. Probably optimal there. But then at some point you’re going to be like, okay, I can crank my volume higher because the literature is crystal clear that cranking your volume, as long as you can recover is probably a good idea. And so you say, okay, there are probably two ways I can crank my volume. One way is I can do more sessions per week, like some people will train three times a week and then go: “My gains are stalled.” and I’m like, hey, there’s nobody on the IFB Pro stage trains three times a week, my friend. The five is probably the average, so try five or try to go to four and then see how four is, go to five. see how five is. So I’d say that’s a good idea. And also specialization by saying, okay, I can’t train everything with 30 sets a week. That’s crazy. I’m human. I’m going to break into pieces. I don’t have that kind of time. And I say, okay, well, most of my muscles I’ll train from 5 to 15 sets. Normally they get the normal gains, and as an intermediate I’ll take, 2 or 3 muscles per mesocycle or per block, a few mesos in a row and really, like, start at ten and just keep cranking the volume up until I get really fatigued and can’t do it any more. And sometimes, you know, for forearms it’ll be 35 sets a week. For biceps that’ll be 30, and for pecs, that’ll be 25. But you get up to pec training 25 sets a week for a few weeks, and your usual is like 10 to 15, you’re going to almost certainly see gains. And so that cranking that volume is something that we almost never tell beginners to do, because it’s just a good way to burn them out. And the return on investment is so marginal for them to make any sense. But the margins change when your intermediate because your regular gains are so small that even slightly bigger gains on an absolute level are at relative level much bigger gains for you, especially the difference between 0 and anything else is infinitely better gains if you think about it. So it starts to be worth it. So I’d say that’s another thing that you could try, really pouring more work effort into it. And then usually… So for intermediates, I wouldn’t say this, but if you’re a more advanced intermediate, I would say it’s probably time to start to work through more exercises in the gym to try different movements. And we have so many movements to try. You’re putting out content to different movements. Milo pack. All the stronger by science people, Jeff Nipper, myself, etc. there’s tons of great people. There’s no shortage of different exercises you can try, and exercises are often very individually specific. Like you like leg extensions? Yeah. Like they really screw you up. My friend, James Hoffman, doctor James… Leg extensions just totally wipe him out. I was like, I can do, like, 5 sets of leg extensions to a pure failure and just smoke a cigarette after and do 5 more, this doesn’t matter. I barely get a pump. Almost nothing happens. But if I do like a high rep set of belt squats or leg presses I can like with one set get sore for three days and some people are like my knees just hurt, I don’t know what the hell you’re doing on there. There’s so much variation and so many ways to move your body in space. So the not only should you be trying different exercises, but slightly different techniques. Do you put the bench bar here on the incline? Do you put it here? Do you put a here? Do you do a guillotine press? Experimenting with that can allow you with a mind muscle connection not only do I feel my muscle moving, but like how much tension do I feel through my muscle? Is it the proper muscle that I’m feeling in this? Is it my feeling triceps in my presses or my pecs, am I getting sore after? So on and so forth. Are the muscles really fatigue? Is the rep drop off really high? Like if you do some kind of new hamstring curl and you rep drop off as insane, you’re like, I cooked my hamstrings. Something happened. And so experimenting like that over a long term can clue you in on what exercises… and also you can do this with the rep ranges and all this other stuff, exercises, technique variants, rep ranges, different split designs to try to see, like, what’s the thing that fits me the best? Because for a lot of individuals, some splits and reps and exercises are just going to be like, oh, oh, this is perfect. Over the course of my career, I’ve had this hundreds of times where I tried something new and I was like, that sucks. What I was doing earlier was better. And also hundreds of times where I tried it and I was like, what the hell was I doing before I figured out how to do this? And I would say that exploratory thing, like, again, it’s not going to be like the difference between night and day, but per individual, some people get some good gains from hack squats, but put them on leg press and they’ll blow up and not only blow up, they like the exercise and it doesn’t hurt their joints as much. They’re axial and systemic fatigue is lower and they can progress on it for longer. And all of a sudden, like even though unit per unit time gives you the same hypertrophy, you’re just going to be able to milk more out with that other one. You know what I mean? It’s like, like, comfortable versus uncomfortable sex positions. Like, oh, they all technically do the job, but you’re going to like some more than others. Try a bunch, see what you like. And if you’re at home alone, like me, then don’t try anything and just look at adult films. -Speaking of specifics… Which exercise do you think… For body parts, let’s start with… Start on the bottom – calves, exercises that people should definitely try or exercise that you recommend most often. Calves are not the most exciting, I guess. -Calves are not the most exciting. Any kind of straight leg calf raise that unloads your spine is probably pretty good. So get on the belt squat, if you have one, go step off the ledge unrack the weight, get the belt going and go down really low off the ledge, hold for two seconds, come up about halfway until it feels easier, and then go back down. And I would do that like mile rep style or a very short rest breaks. I did that yesterday and like I’m not gonna be able to walk most of the rest of the day. It’s just like insane soreness for calves. So I say that’s a good idea. If you’ve been doing seated calf races with a bent leg, I think you just you’re going to get the first calf gains of your life doing this sort of thing. What’s next? Hamstrings? A properly executed stiff legged deadlift is a very rare thing. And, a good morning as well. Same movement really. It’s just is the bar here or here. Because a lot of people will do them and they round their back which unlocks the hips, takes the tension off the hamstrings, they don’t go sufficiently low. So I would say a very good well executed stiff legged deadlift can basically mean that were 2 or 3 sets per hamstring workout. You can get all the stimulus you need, which is really cool. For quadriceps… -Let’s talk… what about the leg curl? Do you think it’s necessary to keep a leg curl movement in there for the short head of the biceps femoris for example? -So like, for beginners and intermediates absolutely not because no one’s going to be able to tell. Neither are you. And you can always start leg curling later in your career and just get, like, awesome gains for the first time ever. If you want complete muscular development and someone who would be stepping on stage, and time is a thing you can afford, I would say like, yes, it’s a very good idea to do some kind of leg curl. What I typically do is if I train hamstrings twice a week, I will do one day where I do hinges and one day where I do curls. And I think it just checks both boxes really well. I would say it’s not the best idea to miss out on either one of those, unless you’re time constrained. And then just do whichever one fits all of your other goals and preferences better. So if you’re like a strength trainer and you want big deadlift and stuff… It’s probably not important for you to be doing many leg curls. But if you’re a person who just only cares about esthetics but you don’t have a ton of time, then I would say mostly leg curls versus hinges are better because they’re a better stimulus to fatigue ratio in many cases. At least, the total systemic and axial fatigue is quite low, they don’t take as much time to do, and they technically probably contribute to a more complete development of your hamstring, especially if you do them in a lengthened position, like a seated like curl with your chest propped forward like that. -For quads you earlier, you already mentioned typically higher rep, very deep type squat movements? -Yeah. -That’s your fave? -Yea, a fave. I would say one of my all time faves nowadays is a really good belt squat. A good belt squat where you come down all the way and sit for like 2 seconds at the bottom, and you come up 2/3rds of the way and come right back down slowly, do a mile rep style, so you get very close to failure, lock out your knees, breathe for 3 or 4 seconds, maybe 5 or 10, and then hit it again and again and again. Do like three rounds of that. Like, it’s actually possible to get a very good workout for many people with 1 set like that. And I think it’s, the axial fatigue is non-existent because the weight attaches at your hips. The systemic fatigue is quite low because it really just kind of is almost only quads at that point, especially if you sit in such a way that…. glutes, but if you sit with your knees going way over your toes, it also doesn’t do your glutes much. A little bit, but not a ton. Also, your glutes leverage against your hips, which leverage to your spine. So if there’s a part of your squat, where are you going like this, glutes are involved, but if the belt is low on your hips, like, glutes don’t even really do much for that. It could be all quads or most quads, definitely some glutes. So, I would say belt squats are like a huge unlock that… I didn’t used to do them because I kind of thought they sucked. But when I, a friend of mine recommended that I do them a certain way, I tried, it was really good, I iterated on that, and I improved it in my own way, and I was like, okay, this is the best quad exercise pound for pound stimulus to fatigue ratio that I found for myself in a long, long time. -What about ABS? Is there even an exercise that you think most people should do for their abs? -I don’t even know if most people should be training their abs. It really just depends on what they want. I like abdominal exercises. Like I like my women: hard, painful, long… -So which exercise would that be? -I like my ab exercises to be based on the same principles as all other exercises. I want them to be a relatively full range of motion with a very long lengthened component. I want them to be loadable, and I want them to be progressable, and I want them to be repeatable in a certain fashion. So I think actually a well-designed abdominal crunch machine with a select rise stack is probably one of the best ab exercises you could do. You could also hold weights and do like an inverted bench, 45 degree invert bench, those are quite good. V-ups are decent. Roll outs, ab wheel roll outs are phenomenal, though they do tax your tricep long head and your lats significantly. Not a big deal, but like if you’re sore everywhere you’re like… It’s just, like, it’s a difficult exercise systemically. But, that ability to have the longest length concomitantly present the biggest tension is huge. Ab rollouts are a little bit difficult to progress. Though I will say, if you can do with what I consider very good technique, 20 ab rollouts, you’re like… I don’t know, we can run you over with a truck and your abs would be fine. But, so there you don’t really need external load in most cases, but I’d say a good resistance profile crunch machine where you really open up and you really crunch down, you really control eccentric and you really crunch down, I mean, I think that’s really, really hard to beat. I just, like, planks and all this fucking shit, I just think it’s such a goddamn waste of time for physique and strength people in most cases. -Yeah, I like the… having the cable attachments with the rope putting it over your shoulders, and then, like a Bosu ball or any type of ball that you can really crunch over to get the range of motion, then use the cable stack, because you can do that in almost any gym. And good ab machines are quite a rarity in the gyms. -What do you do with your feet? -Just put them on the ground. If you get… if you get the right angles it usually works up to pretty high weights. -Okay. -But after body weights you would need some, something to put your feet firmly in place. -Yeah. I have, quite strong abs, and I have very short legs, so I just flip backwards. -Right. -But if you get a bench you put your feet under or a couple of plates, then that can be an excellent exercise for pretty much everybody. -Yeah. For most people, I think, if you dip yourself way to the front of the, the ball, the leverage, it’s usually all right up to around body weight. After that you do start flipping over a lot. -Sure. -Moving to glutes. -Oh, yeah. -Best booty builder. -I mean, front foot elevated smith machine lunges are just really difficult to beat from an experiential perspective. When, like, you can get IOMS from them. Instantaneous Onset Muscle Soreness. When you do one set per leg, you’re like: “Oh, I got a cramp if I move. I got a lay down or some shit.” So it just… -What you think is up with that, by the way, the insane level of soreness that you get in the glute ham tie-in with those types of exercises. I think it’s because most people just don’t do them with a high enough volume and frequency to get used to them. I think it’s just a repeat bout effect. -But specifically the location, right? It’s like very, like, glute ham tie-in. -Is that the case? I don’t know, for me it’s just a whole glute. -I got like the insane… That’s also like the standard bodybuilding law, there’s not really a glute ham tie-in muscle, right? There’s just the glutes… -No. Yeah. Correct. Well, I will say, you know, we do have some data to support the idea of that longer length tension does hypertrophy you distally more and that’s distal part of the glute. And that’s, that’s kind of what it is, I’d say that’s probably something to do with it, but… You know like hip thrust are fine. Hip thrust suffer from a few theoretical problems, a few practical problems. So, you know, like one is that you have to load a fuck load of weight onto a bar. Another one is that, you, the force curve is just backwards. It’s also an isolation exercise, so you just like training glutes by themselves, which is fine if that’s what you want. But a lot of times, like, why not train other stuff too. Front foot elevated Smith machine lunges train your quads quite well, they trainer adductors really well, and they train your glutes into the moon. And train your cardio and your ballsack really well too, because fuck that exercise sucks. And it’s embarrassing because you’re on the Smith machine with like 10s on each side and everyone’s like: “What the hell’s wrong with that guy? His legs are huge, right? He’s so weak!” and you’re like: “You try this, motherfucker!” And I usually do it after quads, so my quads are cooked anyway. So it really is just 10s on a side. It’s kind of embarrassing. -What do you think is wrong with the force curve on a hip thrust? -It is very difficult at the top and at the bottom anyone can lift like 8,000 pounds. -Yeah, true… -And so… -I mean, Bret Contreras might argue that you get probably the highest active mechanical tension in the glutes at the top. So maybe it’s a good thing? You argue it’s too much probably? -I mean like if a force curve was half as extreme, that might be the thing. Also like active mechanical tension is nice. Passive mechanical tension also grows muscle also lengthened tension is so dominant now that it’s difficult to say like how much active tension at the top can counter that? Some. But is it not balance a thing? I’ll say this is where I’m like just currently pretty much by myself in the evidence base community with my bullshit proxies like pump and soreness and fucking shit like that. I do think I still going to win that debate in the end sometime. The pump literature has been very good to me recently. It correlates quite well with growth, we’ll see how that ends up. But I say, like if I do 5 sets of hip thrusts, I get a decent pump, I get a little bit sore, and it’s novel, I haven’t done it before. I’m like, okay, this exercise works. Like, Menno, imagine doing five sets per leg of front foot elevated lunges for first time. Like you won’t come back to the gym. The raw stimulus magnitude is just incomparable. And so I’d say hip thrusts are very, very excellent by the best isolation exercises for glutes or near isolation exercise. And a lot of people like, yeah, the competitive aspirations or they already did enough squats, They don’t want their legs any bigger but they want bigger glutes, man, hip thrusts are… They’re just very difficult to beat. The variety of ways to rig them… Whoever makes the following machine first is going to make a substantial amount of money: Just make a cam leveraged hip thrust machine that makes it very difficult at the bottom, very easy at the top, I will fucking buy one and I will talk about it on the internet and you will sell lots of them. It’s just obvious at this point and no one’s done it yet. So I would say that is a very, very good way to go. And you don’t even have to have some kind of magical construction design. You just have a lever system that’s angled properly at the beginning and that’s it. So the barbell hip thrust is just… it just leaves so much to be desired. And if I have to put six plates onto something that’s on the ground and it’s not a deadlift, I’m just not doing it. -Yeah, a lot of people have that, it’s not time efficient. -Oh my God! -What about, erector spinae? You think squats and deadlifts? That’s all you need? Do you do isolation work for them? -I mean, like, depends on for what? If you want to do, you know -Bodybuilding -Yeah, absolutely. Like, there’s probably no reason to train your erectors for bodybuilding. I would say for overall health I’m increasingly more and more led to believe that dynamic movements for almost every joint are a good idea for preventative measures and for injury prevention, for overall robustness. So I love to do flexion rows of various forms. Cable flexion row, dumbbell, barbell… And that’s where you actually bend at the spine. Ever since I started doing that, like my spinal health, back health has just been like amazing. And I do like combat sport and so my back is always in very precarious positions. The thing is, if you’re very, very strong, just with a locked in posture and someone unlocks you or you bend down to pick up a cup and you pull something in your back because you’re never in spinal flexion. That used to happen to me all the time. I was a decent powerlifter and it still happened to me all the time. So I think some spinal flexion and extension is just a good thing. And for hypertrophy, for physique like rarely. I have really cool like gnarly gigantic spinal erector so I kind of don’t want to lose them and sometimes want to make them bigger just because it’s sweet look. So for vibes yeah, you can do those. But I think having a spinal erector dedicated like… -Like back extensions. -Yeah, back extensions are just like just not a good exercise for so many fucking reasons. They’re not loadable very heavily unless you get the barbell out, then you end up hitting the supports. Fuck this. The force curve’s all wrong because it’s very easy at the bottom, very tough at the top. So on and so forth. So I think, and also like, why not train the rest of your back while doing it? So I just say just do a row with the back extension and there is a flexion row. I do love the way cable rows feel, with the full flexion, because actually, when you’re fully flexed at the bottom of a cable row, the angle of pull for your lats is even better. And so it ends up being just like one of the best all around back exercises that you can do. So I would say this is not very important if you’re doing bent rows and you’re doing stiff legged deadlifts and stuff, I think you’re totally good to go. With squats. your erectors are going to be big and strong. If you have struggle with some back stuff before, I would say starting very light high rep and moving up slowly in weight for flexion rows of various kinds or just like… or Jefferson curls… It’s just like one of the best things you can do for your back. -All right. What about lats? -One arm crossed… I’m kidding. So for lats, man, I just every single time I get away from it, every single time I come back to it, just good old pull ups with any grip… So good, man, they’re so goddamn good. Whether do you want to do them body weight, whether you want to do them weighted… I would say get your chin to the bar, roughly, and then, especially in the bottom two thirds, really milk that eccentric. And you’re not going to able to do that many reps, it’s kind of embarrassing. But you like every time I just cannot beat the DOMS I get and the pumps I get from pull ups with any other back exercise. I’ve tried them all. Nothing compares. Assisted pull ups are awesome, but regular pull ups, man. There’s something special about them. And like, that’s just for me. Some people do them… -You mean pull ups or chin ups? Any grip. -I do not, as I never use the word chin up, ever. I’m not upset that you used it. I’m a little upset. -Convention is like it’s a chin up this way, pull up this way… -Yeah. It’s just like… The exercise to me is called pull up… -You pull yourself up. -Correct. I could even say it’s just called a chin up and then it’s various grips. Cause there’s neutral grip, overhand grip, wide grip, underhand and so on and so forth. There’s also like 45 angle grip which feels quite nice for many people. So I would say like there’s just no wrong answer on grips. It’s whatever feels nice to you. And a lot of them, the right answer is variation. You know, like if someone’s like, hey do you like, you know, blond girls or brunettes or… You would be like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Like, I’ll take them all, goddammit. Not on the same session because, you know, tend to get upset at each other if they’re in the same bed. -What about, rear delts? You do them with your back training? Do you need to isolate them? -Yeah, you need to isolate them if your rear delts are lagging and you can do some rear delt work. That’s quite good. I would actually say one of my favorite exercises for rear delts is the Smith machine. You could do it with the barbell, too. In a rack, the Smith machine inverted row. So you get the Smith machine, you plank your body and you pull yourself and, pulling height can be here, it can be here, it can be here, can be here. Somewhere between here and here is where most people will find, especially if they bring their arms back. Dude, I get a fucking rear delt pump from that. I almost never get a real pump from anything. Also, you get a deep tension, high tension at the stretch. Easier at the contraction because the angle improves for you, vectors get easier and so it’s actually like a really good force curve. It also beefs up the rest of your upper back, which is dope. If you’re spending all of your time on, like, just a rear delts, it’s kind of weird. It’s fine. Then, you know, cross body or rear delt cable stuff is excellent. I hate the rear delt machine. It almost does nothing for me at all, you know, just it ends up being a back exercise. I would just prefer to do the elbows, elbows up and out, face pulls against a barbell. The leverage advantage. You know the TRX? You know what that is? The TRX bands? Those are actually excellent for it because again, they incorporate leverage advantage and with them you can start low and pull high or start high and pull low whichever way hit your rear delts better. I think that’s an excellent exercise. What I generally say to people is I almost always treat rear delts like I treat front delts. I almost never train front delts on purpose. I almost never train rear delts on purpose. Because if you do proper full range of motion back training, bro, if you look at an anatomy book and you look at any back exercise… Pull ups. Tell me rear delt… If you had a tear, like a fucking avulsion in your rear delt, you could do pull ups? No fucking way. It’d be the most painful thing in the world. Oh shit. It looks like they contribute a very large fraction of the force. A lot of people just forget, like like like this… Like… Well, hold on a sec… What other function is part of the delts? To do this. And this. And so you’re doing like 18 sets of rear delts anyway all the time. If you need extra-dope, but what I like to do is for my shoulder volume, all of my shoulder volume, almost all of it, I like extra on the side delt because the side doesn’t get much from pushing and pulling and also the side delt has by far the most visual appeal. Like if you have big rear delts like yeah, it looks cool, if you have big front delts, you look strong, if you have big side delts, like you probably gettin pussy right now, big homie, you feel me? You can’t bat the pussy away, man. It just keeps following you everywhere. -It’s funny, even for rehab there’s research that compound exercises, which anything that pulls the elbow back will train the rear delts, are just as effective as all the standard rehab type external rotation and stuff. -I don’t even know. Don’t even get me started on that shit. -What about traps? Do you isolate those more? -On an as needed basis. I almost never isolate them. I went through a phase where for, like a year and a half I isolated traps, and they got bigger. -Which ones? Middle, lower, upper? -Upper. So because like, so with the way I row with a low angle rowing like mid traps is just not a problem. And so lower traps definitely not a problem. Upper traps could use more work, but honestly like the way, if you do a lot of side delt training, especially with dumbbells and machines and cross body, I mean, like your traps are working. -Do you actively shrug? -No, but what I do is I try to focus on completing the movement with good execution, and I try to focus to make sure that I can feel it in my side delts, you know, like the “elbow up” cue like, pulling with your side delts. But I never, ever, ever try to de-emphasize my traps. And I think that’s a critical problem that many people run into, because the overall neural drive, you can get into a muscle or, he’s going to be limited by your bandwidth mentally of doing 50 other things and be like, okay, do your laterals, focus on your delt delts-okay, focus on not using your traps-okay, focus on your 2017 tax returns, think of all that and what was your first girlfriend’s favorite food? You’d be like, I don’t even fuck I’m doing anymore. You’re not going to get high neural drive. So what I usually tell people is focus on your side delts in side delt training, your traps won’t take over, they will contribute like they’re fucking supposed to. Like when you have people squat, do you tell them focus on your quads? Or do you tell them don’t focus on your glutes? I don’t even know how the fuck to do that. How do you not focus on something? It’s fucking insane. And it’s a big problem because you end up like using 5 kilos instead of 10 kilos, and then you end up just like… oh, the fucking… you know the guys doing this fucking one armed shit, like just to here. And I’m like, why don’t you go higher? Why don’t you use more weight and like fucking: “My traps take over.” And I look at their physique. I’m like: “What traps, motherfucker? You don’t even have any goddamn traps.” And here’s a really good news. If you are working on your biggest side delts that you can and you train them normally your traps will get almost as big or bigger than you’ve even wanted, and that’s amazing. You never have to train your traps. I’ve literally seen men in the gym, guys that are trying to isolate their delts, like with all this crazy shit to get the traps out and then they do shrugs later and I’m just like, did you misunderstand how… it just baffles… that baffles me… -In general, I think there’s a myth in bodybuilding circles that if you get more activity in one muscle group, it must come at the expense of another and research very clearly shows that’s not the case. -Opposite. You know, often case is like really strong triceps can push your pecs to go to limits they wouldn’t be able to before because like you can get the concentric up with more triceps than you’re supposed to and on the eccentric it’s all pecs and your pecs like, dude, I can’t even do this anymore. You can really push your muscles super hard. Do some people have a mind muscle connection problem with a certain muscle? Yes, but don’t worry about the other muscles. Literally don’t think about the other muscles. Think about your pecs. don’t worry about what your triceps are doing. Think about pushing through your pecs. Then you might get a little bit of better result. But like the whole “this other thing is taking over”… Usually it means you need to focus more on the muscle. Here’s another thing. It means your technique might use some work. You imagine someone doing very close grip bench and be like: “I just feel it in my triceps?” Like, oh no shit, motherfucker. Widen your grip a little bit. Some people like… Oh, I’m just getting catty. I don’t, I don’t want to be all negative. But some people like, will talk about mind-muscle connection and feeling a muscle, and you’ll watch them do an exercise of their doing this shit and you’ll like you shut up. What are you doing? Have you ever seen Jared Feather train? When you train like Jared you get to talk about mind-muscle connection till you’re blue in the face. If you don’t train like that, at least start training in a way that externally I can tell you’re like trying to do something organized. Like, I should be like, man, I can’t. I don’t really feel my back in rows and you watch them do rows and they’re like this. You know, like, I don’t I don’t know what you feel at all. I don’t feel my hips or my dick coming out. I don’t know. By the way, do you like my content? Then you’ll love my online PT certification course.

Okay, back to the video. Speaking of triceps and pecs, what are your favorite exercises for those? -So for the pecs, this is like an exercise most people won’t run into. But cambered bar bench presses are just like GOATed beyond recognition. -For the extra range of motion. -Oh my god bro, that extra three inches, let me tell you. Am I right? It’s so big. It’s so big. -But about the bench press now… -Say it again. -We’re talking about the bench press. -Oh, for sure! I… There’s nothing big in my life I would ever say about. So, it’s now 3.5in. The, the stimulus is just wild because, like, on all the technical grounds, like, it’s a very stable movement, it’s a very loadable movement. And it’s very, it’s movement’s easy to replicate technique wise. And all of a sudden it’s a three inches extra insanely difficult eccentric. It just blows your pecs into the moon. So I’d say that’s great. I would say properly executed incline dumbbell presses into which you take the proximal edge of the dumbbell and you touch it to the proximal edge of your bicep or the distal edge of your front delt. Make sure you hear that correctly. I am talking about touching the dumbbell like three inches deeper than your pecs. Because guys do dumbbell press and they stop here. Sometimes they don’t even touch their pecs and I’m like… Every time we have someone on RP, we’re training, We’re like, watch this, we teach them the technique And after one set they’re like, “Oh, oh, holy shit! My chest.” Like, yeah, that’s that’s like pretty straight forward. So those are good exercises. Deficit push ups are amazing. For some folks that want overall chest development and respond well, slightly lean forward dips are actually quite good. I love bench presses. I think bench presses are amazing for the chest. And almost everyone… I know some people don’t like them and I totally get it. Almost everyone that doesn’t like the bench press, or incline press for pecs is almost always doing it wrong. Like they’re not arching or contracting. They’re not controlling the centric, they’re not pausing. Like, of course your fucking shoulders hurt. But they think some of those core movements are just really tough to be. A good press machine is excellent, one that allows you to go really deep, like, that Atlantis machine and things. A lot of… you’ve been around the world, training…. You ever trained on Technogym equipment? -Yeah. -Is there a way we can get the United Nations to, like, cease and desist like Technogym from, like spreading their equipment all around the world? -There’s a few manufacturers that are extremely popular for no reason, that to me that seems related to the quality of the equipment, like force curves are terrible. -Terrible. -Range of motion is not good. They just don’t fit well. The movement. So it feels like a little bit awkward. -Yes. It’s like, I’ve done some of their like lat pulldown stuff and I’m like, I’ve never been able to feel elbow pain on a lat pull down until now. And no lat pump. Like how did you guys do it? -They have some okay… They have some okay machines, but… -That’s one hell of a compliment. -What about triceps? You need isolation work? -Yeah, yeah. Like if you want the biggest triceps, you are behoove you to do isolation work. -What type? Push downs? -So I love skull crushers. The barbell or Smith machine or inverted skull crusher, All to me the same class of movement, are amazing because they have almost the perfect force curve. Especially if you do inverted skull crushers because they’re easier at the top. Way harder at the bottom. And, just by leverage. So I think skull crushers are excellent. I think most people who say they don’t get a lot of skull crushers or their elbows hurt are doing the movement in a way that’s not good for the body, they experiment with different things. Skull crushers. To me, it begins… so there’s a spectrum from close grip bench all the way to overhead behind the neck extension. It’s a full spectrum. So you can do incline skulls. You can do skulls to a bench behind you. You can do skulls to your actual skull. You can do eyes, nose, mouth, chin, throat. That’s actually one of the best exercises I have ever taught anyone. My arms are slightly too big to do it at this point, but. But can you guys see’em, that’s right, that’s right. If you can do this it’s so unbelievable. Get a spotter. But do skull crushers. So unlock at your elbows, I would generally do a false grip because it seems to be easier on the elbows, in my experience, unlock, and then in basically a straight line, come down to where you gently touch, like, open your chin, gently touch and pause for one second with the barbell touching your throat. It’s a deficit. Menno, it fucks people so bad. And it’s just it’s just going to annihilate you. And like that class of movement, deep skull crushers, amazing. Push downs are awesome. I don’t like rope push downs because like they emphasize the contraction, which is the least useful part of the movement and the stretch is kind of always like eh. If you do push downs, I do like people to do the Jared Feather technique where they stay upright and as they bring the bar up, they pull their elbows back to get a deep stretch. I don’t like push downs out front. They’re cool. People are like, yeah, but fucking long head like, yeah, dope. There’s like 18 other ways to train your long head. One of them is just all back movements train your long head quite well. All pulling movements. The other thing is overhead work. I don’t do overhead work for my triceps anymore. Mostly because, I just got big enough to where like… You almost never see, like, like national level guys and pro level guys doing overhead, behind neck extensions. And you’re like, is it just a bro thing? And the reality is they just can’t put their arms there anymore. Like it just doesn’t work. I used to do them for a long time. -They’re too big. -Literally just too big. There’s too much stuff in the way. I did them for a very long time. Some of the very flexible guys can do it, and it’s always a beautiful thing. Unfortunately not in the cards for me, but I did them for years. I did them with a straight bar, I did them with EZ bar… EZ bar standing overhead extensions where you focus on… Your elbows can actually flare any way you want. It’s a decent cue to flare them forward, at least on the way down. Make sure your elbow is pushed really far ahead of you, so it’s like in a squat… You don’t want to squat back and down for your quads, you want to squat forward and down. And so in an overhead extension, you actually want your elbows to move forward as you come down as opposed to back. Now, back work great too but if you move them forward and down, you actually get the peak tension exactly at the peak stretch. And keep them nice and close. Like sets of 15 to 20. EZ bar… Just annihilation. It’s an amazing exercise. Fucks your long head up, fucks every head up. So overhead extensions with cables, with barbells, with EZ bars are awesome. So we have: skull variations, push down… So actually, to use the better anatomical procedure: push downs, skulls, incline variation and overhead. I would do some combination of all those rotated through the years. And I would say for most people, for full development, have some kind of movement that’s either a push down or a skull, one part of the week for triceps or a few of the days, and then one or a few of the days have some kind of overhead movement that you do. And I think it really squares away everything. Dips are excellent, but dips are one of those things like, like in the RP Hypertrophy App we have dips as a tricep exercise, but there’s some nuance there because it does hit your chest. It’s kind of like, oh, it’s kind of more 50-50… There are ways if you plank your body very vertical and when you’re dipping, instead of taking your shoulders and putting them really far forward, which is more chest you actually, this is really difficult, you break and then you let your elbows slide back, but keeping upright. It ends up making like this arm angle at the bottom and it’s fucking brutal. You’re like, oh, I can do 10 dips. Like everyone’s looking at you at the gym. Like this guy is an idiot. In regular dips he could put 225 on and go for forever. Those kinds of dips where you really extend your elbow out, phenomenal for triceps. What I like to do is, for many people to get quite strong, do like 5 sets of overhead extensions or push downs or skulls, and then go do 4 or 5 sets of dips. Holy shit. Like you’re going to do sets of 5 to 10 dips, and every set is going to be like your muscles just burning alive. And it’s all really good. -And then finally, the muscle that all the bros have been waiting for, the guns-biceps. -We did chest already, didn’t we? I’m an idiot. The biceps. So, like, at this point I’ve become like a trillionaire, spoiled bicep exercise enthusiast to where like, if you pick me up in a Mercedes and it’s not a Rolls Royce I’m like, oh, I’m sorry, sir, I’m waiting for my vehicle. And you’re like, I am the vehicle. I’m like, no, there’s been a misunderstanding. I’d never set my foot in one of these. So like barbell curls and shit, cable curls, like they fuck, they’re dope and they work, they’re effective, so they’re great. Feel free to use them. But once you’ve tasted the nectar of inclined curls with a very deep incline, lying curls, on a bench or what… probably my favorite all time bicep exercise… I’m not saying it’s the best, just I love it. Free motion behind the back curls. So really Bayesian curls, but with two arms at a time. And, just basically like the attachments, you step forward and you get the supports to basically be orthogonal to you here so that the cable is pulling back exactly at the bottom. Here you go really far behind your back. I actually did that line curls yesterday, my biceps are sore as fuck. And you pull really far back and then you come up and curl. At the very top here it’s super easy, which is exactly what you want. And you can back up rest for a second, keep going with myo reps. Easy to set up, easy to warm up for. I mean, it’s just like God’s exercise for biceps and it fucking looks lame. But god damn does it screw you up in the best possible way. And because it pulls your elbows back for you and everything, it’s actually, I think, amazing for shoulder health and elbow health because it really stretches the dog shit out of everything. So that. If you don’t have one of those free motion machines, I would say doing dumbbell curls, lay down on a bench and then take dumbbells, come out here, go all the way and up and down… Phenomenal, because the lengthened situation is amazing. The stretch situation is amazing and all of a sudden it’s just a great movement and very easy to do. Myo reps with is not systemically fatiguing. That’s another thing. You lie down and do bicep curls. Like you can do that until you’re blue in the face. Like when you get strong enough standing barbell curls are kind of annoying because like, I don’t know, do you get, like, I get my back gets tired from doing standing barbell curls pretty heavy. I’m just like, ugh… -Yeah. I’m not a big fan of barbell curls in general, -Which is a backwards force curve for hypertrophy. -You don’t get full range motion. You can, if you push your elbows forwards, it’s a little bit better, but then you actually do feel your core a lot with heavy weights. -Yes, yes Jared does that… The Jared curl like that but also like yes, you’re now you get the length and tension, but you’re no longer getting the stretch because you’re actually getting less stretch. And so it’s kind of like you could, you can you can rig curls to be good. Or you can do line curls or behind the back curls and just get like, amazing results. Yeah. -So two things we touched on a few times are good exercise technique, lengthened bias… Actually, third thing is progressive overload. Like to go into those things in bit more detail with problems that people currently face and the last studies. -Yeah. One thing with progressive overload, a lot of people have issue with… They increase the weight, they try to do more reps, but then it comes at the expense of technique. Mindset wise, training wise… How do you deal with maintaining good technique, not compromising range of motion while implementing progressive overload? -I’ll make an analogy here that’s maybe a little funny, but… it’s a stretch, but I think it has some wisdom in it. And I say, you’re hooking up with someone, right? You’re doing the deed. Anyway, sorry. I hope that sound comes through. You’re going back and forth at a certain amplitude… -Amplitude… -Amplitude, man… She’s like: “Oh my God, give me amplitude!” What? Stop picking up physics grad students. -”Increase force output!” -”Oh my God! Let’s do this in an accelerator!” You’re like, “I don’t know if that’s a good idea!” So how important is your amplitude? How important is your rhythm? How important is frequency? How important is all those things important for stroking. Right? How important is it that you are still inside of the vagina? I would say it’s of preeminent importance, because that’s the only place that that matters. It’s a stretch. It’s an exaggeration, but there’s some grain of truth to that that applies to technique. The purpose of technique is not for evidence based bros to be: “Good technique, bro!”, though it does do that. The purpose of technique is to put the tension where you need it to make the stimulus happen. And to keep you safe and to let you know like am I really progressing or am I bullshitting myself. Standardized technique. So technique to me is like a first principles. I don’t like the term first principles because there are many layers of principles, but a lower level of principle than how many reps you’re doing. It’s within the context of good technique, how many reps you’re doing. Here’s a better analogy. You’re doing a bicycle race and you decided to take a shortcut. You won the race, but they don’t give you a trophy and they say you can never compete again. And you’re confused. But I raced my bicycle to the finish line. No, idiot. You were supposed to go around this way, not through this way. Oh that’s right. So because technique allows us to maximize the stimulus, allows us to minimize injury risk and fatigue, and allows us to make sure that we standardize and we know our progression is happening, then technique is something we do not trade out ever. So people always ask me, when is your time to throw technique out the window? Like never. And certainly there are times where I can bullshit you and do nuance. And when I talk to bros, I got to be like, well, sometimes it’s fun, YOLO and all that shit. But real talk, I feel like for real though, like never. Good technique is good technique. And then everything on top of that is like, oh, I can’t do another rep if I use good technique. Good job. Your set is over. Well, I need more stimulus. Sweet, take five seconds of break and do a myo rep, or take two minutes and do another set, or do lengthened partials. But if you have to like, throw your technique off completely to do more reps, I think you’ve really like, you’ve made a fundamental mischaracterization of why you’re in the gym. You’re not in the gym to do reps, you’re not in the gym to… RP Hypertrophy App says 15 reps at 300 pounds, you’re not there to get 15 reps. You are there to stimulate the muscle, which means you do good technique and then however many reps you can with good technique. Is 15 the goal? Yes. Do 15. Can you not do 15? Then it’s 14 and you’re done. To me, Menno, it’s that simple. Am I missing something? -Mindset wise you basically have to get zero tolerance policy. You just have to… -Great question. Not zero tolerance in an insane OCD way because guys will be like, their elbows will do this, they say: “That’s it. I’m failing.” No no no no no no no no no no no. Fundamentally decent technique, right? So like sometimes you’re… We’re going to getting banned on YouTube for the shit I’m going to say. It’s going to use another vagina analogy. Like it is not true to say that your penis has to go all the way in every time and almost all the way out every time. Sometimes you can have a few mid strokes in there, sometimes a long strokes, but make sure it’s still in. Technique is how I look at it. Like, are you still doing the range of motion that you try to do? Is your ability to control your body still decent? Like if you’re doing dumbbell press, this is what a good rep looks like. This is what a bad rep looks like? Fuck it, send it, do another one. But if a bad rep looks like this, like bro, you’re done. If someone who’s a third day at the gym can tell you you have bad technique you’re not doing good technique anymore. So there’s a tolerance limit. But the tolerance limit is small enough to know, like I’m still doing the thing. Let me give you another decent analogy. Driving a car. Just don’t get half your car on the other lane. If your wheel hits this lane a little bit and then that lane, you’re good. But don’t drive on the fucking wrong side of the road. And I think most people, when they struggle with what’s perfect technique and what’s good technique, a lot of times they really know what it is but it’s very easy to give yourself the excuse to say, oh, my technique is not good anymore because you could push it further and still have decent technique. Here’s another thing. I’ll speak for Jared, though he’s not here. What Jared would say is this: when you feel that your technique is slipping, that’s when it’s time to have even better technique. Like, oh fuck. Like, oh, I don’t know if I can do this with a good technique. Sweet. Really retract and go again. But now think even more technique and even more strength. It’s not versus. It’s at the same time. It’s like, do I swing my sword around like this with zombies or I do like…. Well, no. You do the Roman short sword. It’s athletic, it’s fast, but it’s also precision. It’s both. It’s both, like, that’s the best way to describe it. So don’t get psychotic and OCD and be like, oh, as soon as my elbows are off… As soon as your technique feels off-fix it. Fix it right there for the next rep. And if you’re trying your goddamn best and your technique is really getting wacky, then it’s time to go. Technique is one of those things, like something they say about, like collapsing nations and armies and stuff is everything seems fine until the whole thing goes, you know. Technique is one of those to me where if you really try to focus on it again and it doesn’t work, then, you know, it’s no go. -Right. And how do you feel about the recent preprints that came out that’s show supposedly technique doesn’t matter? Yeah, for those that don’t know. Yeah, it’s a group of untrained individuals. It’s a limitation. Trained one arm with push downs and biceps curls. One arm did strict technique, elbow at the side, just the elbow motion, and then the other arm used a lot of body movements, body English where the push downs kind of turning into a dip, like lean into the weight and for the curls really swing up the weights and make sure you get the weight up kind of no matter what. And they got essentially equal gains in this eight week study. -I mean there’s a usual limitations of first of all it’s only a weak second of all it’s on untrained people. Another problem is one study at a time shows you almost nothing and then multiple studies together show you something. So taking all those limitations, I would say if we just say, okay, actually, this study is revealing the ground truth and this study turns out to be one of those, like, really middle of the bell curve studies after 20 studies are conducted. Let’s just assume that for experiment, for just like thought experiment sake. I would say what that studies illustrated is that you get roughly the same growth for if you cheat or if you don’t cheat. And there is a way to interpret that it doesn’t matter if you cheat or not. And that way to interpret that study is wrong. Because if you take your car and you drive 150 miles an hour, and you get to someplace weaving in and out of traffic and you get to that place at the same time as someone who drives 60 miles an hour and drives calmly, you can say, it just doesn’t matter how fast you go. And that’s true as far as the measured variable of how soon you get there. Because like, everyone ran into traffic and it just didn’t matter. But that’s looking at part of the picture. I’ve never heard anyone say that strict technique will have a very high effect of maximizing your direct stimulus to the muscle. I’ve never made that claim myself as far as I can tell. For some people the technique is so bad that that’s the case, but for most folks it’s just fine. So what I’m saying is if you do cheat curls your biceps will grow plenty big and strong. The thing is what are you paying? What are the costs? So you’re using more weight to get the same effect, or you’re doing more reps to get the same effect. -Which was indeed the case in this study. -Correct? You spend extra energy from all the other muscles of your body. You are needlessly exposing yourself to injury risk and fatigue. -Because of the higher weights? -Because the higher weights, because you’re doing more mechanical work. And the mechanical work… Imagine there’s another way to say this. Like the two groups did very different amounts of mechanical work. The cheat group did much more work, but only got the same exact results. Holy shit, why would you do that? And so if you think that doing cheat reps like bent rows, cheat bent rows, cheat curls, is going to grow you muscle. Well, you’re right, but how many more sets of bent rows could you have done if you just did strict technique and just had more energy to do more sets of bent rows? And how much better would your leg workouts go two days later because you didn’t use your posterior chain to lift half the weight? The answer is it’s meaningful and significant. And so what I would say is this study is hopefully one of many we’ll see in the future that I think probably will illustrate the fact that cheating is a fine way to get direct gains, but the stimulus to fatigue ratio is just highly suboptimal. The stimulus to risk ratio is highly suboptimal. There have been many people who have done strict curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people screw themselves up on… or sorry, strict curls, cheat curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people get hurt doing strict curls. And so at the end of the day, it’s like if I’m taking all of these other risks and imposing this much fatigue on the rest of my muscles, on my system, on my spine, what else am I getting out of it? And the answer is nothing. Well, gee whiz, man, that means really, that good technique is a really good thing. And to me, the study is just a really good partial recognition of the fact that good technique has really big upsides. So we did not need a study on this. We could have reasoned through it. Good to have a study because our reasoning could be wrong. It’s never a good bet unless you have empirical testing. But, that’s the way I interpret the study is like, yes. So on mechanistic grounds, there’s I wouldn’t actually predict that you could have less growth. Like, I’ll put it this way… If the study discovered that there’s significantly less growth for the cheat rep condition, I would actually be a little bit confused. Like, fuck man, I guess my muscle connection really does matter a lot or something. Like maybe like, I don’t know, like the triceps don’t really get to failure because everything else did. It would really be confusing. And the high absolute forces on the eccentric and stuff like they help, they help, but apparently they don’t help enough. And so the stimulus to fatigue ratio, stimulus to risk is not great. And now it’s something that we can be more confident about saying. No doubt people will put out the study and comment and Instagram comments on YouTube about how technique is done and cheat reps work and it would just say that most of those people just haven’t thought it through sufficiently and most of those people aren’t the kind of people that need to think about things. They do have a feeling. And then they later do the very mild level of thinking on top of that, to justify their feelings. -Another area that we’ve had a lot of studies on recently that work mostly in the negative is the lengthened bias. So we had a lot of really compelling research initially coming out pretty much at the same time, an avalanche of research in favor of exercises with more lengthened bias, even lengthened partials beating full range of motion training. And then last month alone, we had meta analysis, well, October this was… Meta analysis showing that lengthened exercises have basically a trivial effect size in favor or over shortened exercises like training at longer muscle lengths does produce more growth, but it’s pretty much trivial. And then we had two studies in trained individuals showing pretty much equal growth with lengthened partials versus full range of motion training, in contrast to the basically two other studies, compelling studies that we had showing at lengthened partials even beats full range of motion training interestingly. And now we also have a study showing that, cable lateral raises didn’t significantly produce more growth, a bit of a trend… -I saw that… -than dumbbell lateral raises. So has the tide turned? Is lengthened bias still something you should seek out in your training? -If you look at all the studies together, there is still a clear relationship that the lengthened component is extra special. I don’t think it’s by like double or triple the growth. I never thought that. I think it’s by a margin, but I think it’s one of those things where if you can easily do exercises that accommodate a longer length, if your stimulus proxies also agree, like it gets you way more sore, way more pumped, way more locally fatigued, and has allowed you to progress faster and see better visual gains than I would say, because you have full decision about what to do in the gym, I would say my best advice, and this has been the case for a long time, if you can manage to, don’t skip the deep bottom stretch of an exercise and pick exercises that load the deep bottom stretch extensively. Whatever else you do, do you want to do partials? Sweet. Do you want to do full range? Cool. Do you want to squeeze at the top? Dope. But if you have an exercise in which you’re missing that like bottom half or the bottom half is there but with like incline curls, it’s just not loaded. I say probably not doing your best to get the growth that you want. Is it marginal? Absolutely. Could you just do more sets of shortened partials and still get the same growth? Yeah, definitely. Stimulus to fatigue ratio. Does that make sense? No, not a ton. I think the local fatigue imposed by lengthened partials is massive. But that’s what you want. For similar or lower systemic fatigue, which is good. So I say my my best tentative conclusion for now, this could change, is at the very least try to have most of your exercises not obviously skip the lengthened component and try to load it extensively. Does that mean you should be doing lengthened partials for everything? I’m not confident enough to say that yet. The recent literature has not been kind to it yet or so far, and so I would say at the very least, just don’t skip that bottom part and really focus on it and whatever else you want to do is kind of like, no one really knows what else is better. Just for a bunch of functional benefits and stuff I think full range of motion is kind of cool. And so what I would say is… and there was a direct study on this a little while back where it was like emphasizing the lengthened component with full range versus just lengthened and they got essentially the same results, I’d say, like, yeah, like… That’s more or less how I train much of the time is emphasizing the bottom stretch, but still going through most of the top. -Right. It makes sense. I think in general, a big confusion is that people have, with fitness research they interpret something as like this is now debunked. -Yeah. -Whereas if you look at it purely empirically, like, like a statistician, many of the things we recommend that we have in common, even though we disagree on some things, is that almost all the things we recommend purely statistically, even if you don’t know the mechanisms, you have no idea if this study is good, that study is good, but research overwhelmingly shows it’s either positive or neutral, and the chance of it being detrimental is very small. -Yes. -And you could make that argument with high frequency training, with lengthened partials, like with partials maybe not so much, but at least making sure that you stimulate muscles at long muscle lengths. -Yes. -It’s going to be either positive or maybe at worst neutral. But, based on the current literature, the chance of it being harmful is really, really small. -Yeah. Yeah, harmful or missing out on obvious gains. -Yeah. -Which is the biggest harm of all. -Yeah. -Yeah, 100%. And I think people often also mistake or just don’t understand… Not to their, you know, not trying to, you know, disparage anybody, but like, effect sizes are just something people don’t really know. Most people think, they just don’t know the difference between significance and effect size. And just to sort of clear this up. So significance is like, can you even really say you’re looking at two different things? Even though they might be very, very like someone’s like, okay, here’s significance, ready? You get two different species of South African ant, and a really like deep dive insect person would be like, yeah, those are two different species. They look the fucking same. They’re both tiny and damn near equivalent, but they actually are different. But are they different in any meaningful way? Like well, this one not bite me? Like no, they both fucking bite you. Like, okay. Do they behave differently? Like not really, they’re about the same. But they’re different. We know they’re different. That’s significance. So when someone’s like, oh, this is significantly better. Like, you know, it’s almost certainly really better. Effect size is by how much better. And so it’s kind of like, oh, oh, here’s actually a better one than the ant analogy. You get 2 pro boxers, a guy that’s ranked #1 and a guy that’s ranked #3. Is it true that the rank one guy is significantly better? Yes. Is it true that the effect size of him being better is high? No. Every third match he lose to the other guy and also, if you look at a guy at a club and he looks at you wrong, you’re like, “The fuck is that guy?” Like, “Oh, that’s the boxer dude.” You’re like “Yeah, what’s his rank?” Like? “He’s #3.” Like “I’m going to fuck him up!” Like, no you’re not. No you’re not because you’re ranked nothing And he’s going to… he’s like ten times the boxer you’ll ever be. That’s effect size. So we go back to the exercise science literature. People will say, you know like lying leg curls are inferior to a seated leg curls in many experiments. True. Significant. So they’re different. But like lying leg curls are like the, #3 boxer and seated are like #1, like they’ll both fuck you up big time and the differences between them are nuanced and also if you match up to that #1 boxer and like, you have some kind of advantage where you’re like, you’re a southpaw or you have really big reach, you actually have better results against the #1 guy then against the #3 guy, the #3 guy comes way into your circle too match, his uppercut game is out of this world, his body shots are gnarly, and while that #1 guy can neutralize him, you can’t. And so it’s actually better for you to be fighting the #1 guy. And for some people lying leg curls work definitely better than seated leg curls. And if you do seated leg curls for six months straight by novelty alone lying leg curls will be better. That’s how close it is. And I think some people will confuse those two. They’re different by a margin versus they’re meaningfully different in a way that you can apply and that’ll take things like, oh man, like so we don’t do anything at a shortened length anymore. Like, no no no, they’re still great, but like, it’s probably true to say that on average it’s a little bit better to emphasize the lengthened component, and it’s a bit of nuance there, for sure. The reality is like, you know, go to the gym, read the literature, do generally the stuff that’s a good idea, experiment with the stuff that maybe you don’t know about, the stuff that’s not as good-try it anyway and see if you like it and if you like and it works for you, great. Fucking do it. But, don’t pretend like, you know, some things are just categorically just night and day better than others. Those things do exist, for sure, but they’re mostly like, how do I get my quads bigger? Is it doing bicep curls or is it doing leg extensions? Like, yes, you will see very big effect sizes there. -Mike Israetel, everyone. I would tell you to promote your products or anything, but everyone on this channel knows who you are. They can find everything on the Renaissance Periodization channel. You also have your own Making Progress channel for non fitness stuff. And yeah, everybody already knows who you are. -Excellent.

ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

For years, the internet has been shrinking. Not in size, not in data, but in ownership. A vast, decentralized network of personal blogs, forums, and independent communities has been corralled into a handful of paved prison yards controlled by a few massive corporations. Every post, every “friend,” every creative work—locked behind closed doors, and you don’t have the keys. The fediverse is a jailbreak. It’s not a product, not a single platform, it’s not something you can buy stock in or use to enrich yourself at the cost of our shared humanity. It’s a network of independent, interconnected social platforms, all running on open protocols like ActivityPub. It’s an ecosystem where you - not some incellionaire obsessed with eugenics - own your digital identity. Where your social graph belongs to you, not an algorithm’s shifting fucking whims. Where moving from one service to another doesn’t mean losing everything you’ve built and everything you’ve ever said. We’ve been trained to believe that the way things are is the way they have to be. That Meta, Google, and whatever the hell Twitter is calling itself today are the price of admission to digital society. That you can’t have discovery without algorithmic engineering. That the internet was supposed to become a shopping mall where every interaction is measured in ad revenue. But none of this was inevitable. It was built this way—on purpose. And the fediverse offers something else: freedom. This isn’t a utopian fantasy. It’s not a pipe dream, like web3’s non-existent decentralization. It already exists. Mastodon, Pixelfed, Lemmy, PeerTube, BookWyrm—these are real platforms, these are real people, these are real conversations. The problem isn’t that the fediverse isn’t viable. The problem isn’t that it’s “too complicated.” The problem is that the giants of Silicon Valley have spent 20 years convincing us that anything outside their control isn’t worth our time. And that’s just not bloody true. We’ve all seen what happens when social media platforms treat users as a commodity rather than a community. Creators who built entire careers on centralized platforms, only to see their reach strangled and manipulated by "bonus" programs and algorithms. Friends and networks erased overnight by corporate priorities and billionaire egos. Whole communities forced into digital exile because they didn’t fit the new monetization strategy. The fediverse is an escape from that cycle. It’s digital self-determination. The fediverse won’t succeed just because it’s better. It will succeed if and only if people choose it. If they reject the idea that being trapped in someone else’s ecosystem is just the cost of existing online. If they stop believing that “free” means surrendering ownership of your own connections, your own history, your own data. If they see that the internet wasn’t built to be a factory for engagement metrics and AI-generated content farms. It was built to connect us, not silo us to pad a wealth-extremist’s bank account. We don’t need billionaires. And we sure as shit don't need their vision for the future of our web. We need our vision. The fediverse isn’t a distant dream—it’s here, right now, waiting for you to step outside the walls and see what’s possible. The internet was meant to belong to everyone. And it still fucking can. Fuck it man. Just put on some Grateful Dead. Put on some Aretha. Print some kind of zine. Paint a sign. Start a band. Write a manifesto. Bootleg a t-shirt. Hand out stickers. Throw a party. Keep it weird. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 cast a long shadow. France, humiliated and burning for revenge. Germany, rising and certain it had to strike first to stay on top. Every decision, every alliance, every military maneuver was shaped by one core belief: another war wasn’t just possible—it was inevitable. We curate ourselves into something safe. We smooth out our rough edges. We keep things palatable, we stay detached, we’re less invested, we’re dedicated to avoiding embarrassment at all costs. That’s the mantra. Be cool. Be aloof. Don’t try too hard. Don’t try at all. A blog about stuff

Title: Jamaican tech workers targeted by recruiters, attracting high salaries
URL: https://jamaica-gleaner.com/article/business/20250309/jamaican-tech-workers-targeted-recruiters-attracting-high-salaries
Time Published: 2025-03-09T05:20:53Z
Full Content:
A United States-based fintech firm is currently recruiting at least 20 software engineers for a project here in Jamaica that will see them earning a starting salary of $10 million per year. But insiders in the tech sector say it is not unusual for foreign companies to scout local talent, some of whom migrate to take up positions elsewhere, while others work remotely here in Jamaica. Intellibus, described as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States and which is at the forefront of artificial intelligence and platform engineering, is looking for about 20 to 25 tech graduates to create a hub in Jamaica to service its clients in the US. To find the right persons, the company is organising a hackathon in which groups of students and potential employees will collaborate in solving problems, using coding to test their suitability to join the Intellibus team. “We know of the BPO sector, which hires 60,000 people, but the question is, how do we create a robust software sector, which requires a higher level of productivity and where employees can demand higher pay. For the Jamaican economy to really be transformed, the conversation must be, how do we boost the economy to the next level through productivity through the service sector?” Aditya ‘Ed’ Watal, founder and principal of Intellibus, told the Financial Gleaner. The India-born Watal spoke on the impact of AI on the job market at the Jamaica Stock Exchange’s Regional Investments & Capital Markets Conference in January, and returned a few weeks later to set up his Jamaican project. Watal said his company usually employs only one per cent of the persons interviewed, but said the bar had to be lowered for the Jamaican operation, meaning, about 500 persons will be interviewed. “I am trying to run an experiment that says, can I hire 20 people who are able to do similar jobs to the people that I have in the US today, are those people available and can I find them quickly enough?” Watal said. The entrepreneur said, based on his research, software engineers in Jamaica have a starting salary of US$35,000 per year (about $5.5 million). He said Intellibus is willing to pay about $10 million per year. A software developer with more than 30 years in business confirmed that only persons with a master’s degree and at least 10 years’ experience would normally command a $10-million salary. Watal said a similar project he tried in Cyprus, a member country of the European Union, was unsuccessful, but he believes it will be different in Jamaica. “We tried an experiment like this in Cyprus, but we did not scale it because, geographically, it was too far, and the economic advantage was also not as much. We weren’t getting a huge price break, because (Cyprus) is still part of the EU,” he said. Watal said in the US, his company has to pay top dollar for talent to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. Meanwhile, technology consultant Christopher Reckord told the Financial Gleaner that there is very little recent data on the size of the tech sector. He said, however, that most jobs now require some level of knowledge of technology. “When I started in this industry we were providing technologies and tools, running cable, and installing networks and computers in offices. All these things were connected by a wire; Wi-Fi never existed. A massive leap forward four decades later and we are communicating right now with technology that didn’t exist 40 years ago,” Reckord said. Reckord indicated that many other companies from abroad recruit tech workers from Jamaica, some doing so through LinkedIn and other social media sites. More than 500 persons graduate from the University of Technology, Jamaica, UTech, and the University of the West Indies, Mona campus with degrees in computing each year. The UTech annual report for 2019-20, the latest year available on the institution’s website, showed that there were 758 undergraduate offers in the School of Computing and Information, which is in the Faculty of Engineering and Computing. The bachelor’s degree in computing can be completed in either three or four years. Meanwhile, at UWI Mona in 2022-23, there were 1051 students registered in the Department of Computing across the three years of the bachelor’s degree. With technology rapidly changing the work world, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica is also changing how tech jobs are counted in labour force statistics. A representative at Statin said that while the Jamaica Industrial Classification, JIC, for industry workers underwent a review in 2024, the new classification has not yet been published. In the previous JIC in 2016, tech jobs were represented in the industry group ‘information and communication’. Statin last estimated the size of the information and communication employed workforce at 17,200 persons. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com

UPDATED 10:58 EST / MARCH 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Since the generative artificial intelligence awakening, we’ve said consistently that Nvidia Corp. and Broadcom Inc. are the No. 1 and No. 2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, down on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt and more. Broadcom’s fiscal first-quarter results were impressive and support our base case for the company. They also calmed some investor concerns, at least for now. At one point the night after the earnings print, Broadcom’s stock was up 15% from its previous close, and finished up nearly 9% on Friday, despite a down day in tech. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high-growth sectors are not big enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. Nvidia doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different situation in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Multiple high-volume hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. In this Breaking Analysis, we pivot off of Broadcom’s Q1 earnings to revisit our thesis on the company. That premise has centered on the idea that connectivity both within the XPU complex and across distributed clusters remains a massive opportunity for Broadcom, combined with a radically new strategy for VMware that is delivering results much in the way as we projected. We initiated our Broadcom coverage in earnest on Breaking Analysis about three years ago, triggered by the VMware acquisition. Several of our research notes are shown below, tracking the company’s semiconductor and expanding software business. Let’s start by looking at how Broadcom applied its ethos to VMware. Broadcom’s acquisition strategy for VMware — initiated several years ago — has been executed in almost exact alignment with leadership’s publicly stated plans. Initially, industry observers were skeptical about Broadcom’s ability to “tame the VMware beast,” given VMware’s historically broad portfolio and aspirational visions. The subsequent narrowing of VMware’s focus, increased attention to core products, and elevated pricing strategy all confirm that Broadcom is following a well-defined operational model. Specifically, we expected Broadcom to focus research and development to prioritize core value areas, shed non-performing assets and push customers toward bundled subscription offerings. Though this tactic has created frustration among longtime VMware users accustomed to perpetual licensing structures, it has also driven measurable gains in revenue and profitability. This shift forces customers onto higher-value contract models, which in turn boosts average deal sizes. Notably, many critics attribute the changes to “price hikes,” although Broadcom characterizes them as “increased value.” There is legitimate merit to Broadcom’s assertions, despite the forced move to bundling. We documented this on theCUBE with Broadcom’s Drew Nielsen last summer at VMware Explore. We found the economic analysis to be fair and defensible, with the fundamental and controversial assumption that customers go “all in” on the VCF bundle. In our opinion, one of Broadcom CEO Hock Tan’s defining traits is a high “do:say” ratio. By closely examining past statements, we find that Broadcom’s strategic moves consistently align with Tan’s predictions. Our research suggests that customers — though often uncomfortable with the forced transition to subscription and bundled packages — benefit from a company that reliably executes on its roadmap. This level of predictability resonates with financial stakeholders, despite short-term challenges in the customer and partner ecosystems. Broadcom’s operational philosophy was highlighted last year at MWC, better known as Mobile World Congress, during discussions with the company’s semiconductor chief, Charlie Kawwas. The consistent message emphasized Broadcom’s ability to drive durable business outcomes and navigate new frontiers such as AI, all while applying the same methodical, profit-oriented approach. We believe these insights reinforce a unified corporate ethos — one that systematically applies proven processes to each new acquisition and market challenge. Though critics may continue to voice concerns about Broadcom’s vision for VMware’s combined offerings and licensing approaches, our research indicates that Broadcom’s results and track record of fulfilling stated goals cannot be dismissed. Customers that have long enjoyed perpetual licenses are being pushed toward subscriptions, often experiencing sticker shock in the process. Nonetheless, our data suggests that many of these organizations are willing to absorb the transition if they see tangible returns and ongoing product innovation. In our view, this dynamic underscores the importance of aligning cost structures with demonstrated value. Despite market chatter about negative customer experiences, Broadcom’s consistent execution has validated its strategic plan and strengthened its reputation on Wall Street. We believe the transition to a subscription-based model — though abrupt for some — reinforces Broadcom’s broader ambition of extracting higher margins and focusing on profitable, core technology areas. Our research indicates that VMware’s licensing and pricing changes — initiated under Broadcom’s stewardship — have triggered noticeable market backlash, which is reflected in the Enterprise Technology Research data. This data illustrates customer sentiments and spending intentions across several hundred VMware accounts, spanning various product lines. In our view, the most striking evidence of this negative reaction lies in the shift in Net Score — a metric similar to a Net Promoter Score except Net Score applies to spending intentions. Below we show the ETR methodology applied to VMware. Net Score tracks the percent of more than 700 VMware customers in the ETR survey within the following categories as shown above: Collectively, we see Net Score, which subtracts the red from the green and is reflected in the blue line, dipping from the mid-20s into negative territory, suggesting that VMware is experiencing real pressure in the market. The pervasion metric — VMware’s percentage of overall customers in the ETR survey — also declined, reinforcing the narrative that some organizations are walking away from or reducing their VMware footprints. One would look at these results and come to the conclusion that VMWare is in real trouble. But that conclusion is not correct. On the chart above the vertical axis is Net Score or spending momentum, what we just explained in the previous chart, and you can see the dot plots for VMware over time. VMware’s Net Score went from around 20% down to the negative territory. It kept steadily tumbling since January of 2023. We’ve plotted Nutanix, Ubuntu, and Red Hat, picking three target platforms that potentially people would migrate to. We left Microsoft out because it always skews the data. One would look at this data and think it’s really bad news for VMware, but the reality is that this doesn’t reflect revenue — it’s an account-based metrics. In our opinion, these trends reflect a combination of higher costs, forced migrations to subscription bundles, and significant shifts in VMware’s operating model post-acquisition. VMware’s large installed base suggests that Broadcom is comfortable with the negative impact of abrupt pricing changes, reduced flexibility and low margin customer defections. The evidence shows that many customers continue to invest in VMware solutions, suggesting that the company retains a measure of loyalty, albeit forced, and a core foundation on which it can rebuild. Going forward, we believe it will be critical for VMware to strike a balance between monetization and customer satisfaction. This means a continued investment in core functionality and innovation, including supporting AI workloads with what VMware terms “Private AI” — that is, on-premises workloads. In our view, the driving rationale behind Broadcom’s evolving business model is shown below and describes the pressures facing traditional hardware infrastructure — specifically server, storage and networking. These segments are increasingly squeezed by advances in silicon, cloud economics and software, which continue to take value from the middle of the stack. As a result, Broadcom has systematically repositioned itself, participating more aggressively in two key value-creation areas: Last year at MWC 2024, Kawwas underscored the crucial role of networking in AI workloads. When scaling beyond single XPUs, interconnecting massive clusters becomes paramount. According to Kawwas, the inability to scale up to thousands of XPUs effectively — without the right networking strategy — diminishes performance and efficiency. In our view, Broadcom’s approach highlights its capacity to integrate hardware and software solutions that address the full scope of AI’s demands. [Kawwas explains the changes to connectivity required by AI workloads.] When you talk AI, everything has changed because with AI, you have these elephant workloads that cannot run on a single processor, whether it’s a GPU, TPU, NPU, the flavor of the day, let’s call them for the next 15 minutes XPUs. If you take these XPUs, and you take some of these elephant workloads, you can’t run them on a single XPU. You can’t even run them on eight CPUs or XPUs or GPUs, you have to now scale into the thousands today, thousands of these. In order to do that, you’ve transcended now a single system where you’ve scaled up. Now you have to scale out to many, many of these systems and racks, and you have to interconnect them. And guess what? If you don’t have the right network strategy and connectivity strategy, this will not work, this will not scale up. – Charlie Kawwas, Broadcom The conversation around AI also surfaces a notable duopoly in the networking space with only two company’s truly able to excel at connectivity within the chip and across large-scale clusters: We believe competition will intensify as AI expands beyond traditional data center workflows, but the massive market for flexible, high-performance network fabrics is booming. Though each player differentiates via proprietary versus more open approaches, the rapidly growing size of the AI market suggests headroom for both to thrive. Overall, we believe Broadcom’s strategy of balancing semiconductor innovation with infrastructure software is well-positioned to address the next wave of high-performance, AI-driven workloads. The one area we’ve felt was lacking for VMware has been its lack of a clear data strategy. It appears VMware generally will leave the data piece to its customers and others in the ecosystem to sort out. In reviewing Broadcom’s performance from May 2022 to March 2025, the numbers paint a vivid picture of how the VMware acquisition has fundamentally altered the company’s profile. The most striking theme is the accelerating shift toward software: Our analysis indicates that, while some legacy VMware customers are exiting due to price hikes or dissatisfaction with forced subscriptions, Broadcom remains focused on high-value customers willing to adopt its full VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) stack. According to Broadcom, approximately 70% of its top 10,000 customers have migrated to VCF, driving improvements in gross and operating margins. Those customers no longer aligned with Broadcom’s direction are effectively being pruned from the portfolio. Beyond VMware, Broadcom continues to leverage the surge in AI-driven workloads: One of the few negatives in Broadcom’s financial picture is free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, down from over 50% to around 40%. Management attributes the decline to several factors: Despite these headwinds, investors appear willing to tolerate near-term pressures in light of Broadcom’s operating discipline and rapid revenue expansion. Critics often liken Broadcom to a private equity firm, arguing it narrows R&D investment and focuses on near-term extraction. However, from our perspective, Broadcom employs a deliberate approach to concentrate R&D on core technologies (for example, Tomahawk switches, SerDes, custom silicon for hyperscalers). While it curtails broad experimentation, it invests heavily in targeted areas with strong returns — contributing to robust margins and a notable market valuation surge. Looking ahead, Broadcom’s strong orientation toward software, AI and custom silicon positions it to regain the trillion-dollar market-cap mark if current momentum continues. The TAM expansion signaled by Tan ($60 billion to $90 billion excluding the four new design wins), coming from hyperscaler demand for XPUs and AI infrastructure, further bolsters the bullish case. The chart above, developed by David Floyer, depicts total data center spending worldwide — including servers, storage, networking, power and cooling, and also hyperscale infrastructure. After years of relative flatness and even contraction in 2020, the market has entered a super cycle fueled by “extreme parallel processing” or EPP, or what Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang often calls accelerated computing. Overall, the data center market is entering an era where parallel processing becomes the default architecture for emerging workloads, driving unprecedented growth and reshaping vendor strategies. From an investor perspective, companies enabling EPP — particularly in the areas of specialized compute, high-speed networking and AI acceleration — stand to capture significant new value as the market rockets toward a trillion dollars and beyond. Broadcom and Nvidia in our view are two of the most well-positioned “picks and shovel” companies that will benefit from the growth of this market. Broadcom now counts three primary hyperscalers (Meta, Google, ByteDance) plus two additional disclosed, plus two more unnamed design wins. In our view, these design wins anchor Broadcom’s strategy of mixing custom and merchant silicon, complemented by a robust software business. Broadcom’s durable approach — projects lasting 10 years or more — mirrors its history of building deep moats and reliable profit engines. The company highlights a $60 billion to $90 billion SAM by 2027 for its AI-related offerings, excluding the potential upside from the newly added “+2” hyperscalers. According to company statements, Broadcom’s AI business currently operates at a $16 billion run rate, growing at 40% to 50% (with a notable 77% spike in the latest quarter). These figures underscore a trajectory that could elevate Broadcom to a scale comparable to other top AI enablers such as Nvidia. Despite Broadcom’s positive momentum, regulatory questions loom. Hock Tan has been queried on how AI export restrictions and technology diffusion rules might impede sales to Chinese hyperscalers (for example, ByteDance and Alibaba). Though Broadcom can partially tailor its silicon to comply with controls (for example, down-tuning certain features), it ultimately cannot dictate geopolitical policy. The company’s ability to navigate these evolving restrictions will be crucial for sustaining future growth. Broadcom stands out as a durable, highly profitable enterprise, enjoying both near-term gains in AI networking and longer-term expansions of its custom silicon customer base. Though there are real risks — especially around export controls and an uncertain geopolitical environment — the company’s diversified approach, deep moats and robust margin profile suggest a compelling story for investors. Whether one is bullish, bearish or neutral likely depends on risk tolerance for regulatory issues and belief in Broadcom’s capacity to execute on its design wins. What do you think? Is Broadcom’s software strategy forcing you to rethink your on-prem infrastructure partners? Or are you staying the course and sticking with VMware, defecting or taking a hybrid approach?

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is one of the most customizable leverless fighting game controllers yet, while still retaining the comfortable ergonomics of its flagship fight sticks. It will still take many more hours of mental rewiring if you're used to a traditional joystick, but with additional customizable buttons to suit your playstyle, there's no better way to transition over to this fighting game meta. Customizable button placements right out of the box Thin, light design but still with a comfortable wrist slope on the surface Switching out buttons is very easy More affordable than the standard Victrix stick Bulkier than other leverless options Leverless controls take time to adjust Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The Turtle Beach Victrix Pro KO is the latest premium take on the leverless all-button controllers that have been transforming the fighting game community's meta in recent years, built for the current generation of consoles while still backwards compatible with last-gen consoles at the click of a switch (while the controllers are also compatible with PC, you will need to buy separate controllers for PlayStation and Xbox consoles). It's a much sleeker build than Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller while retaining similar features, such as customizable LED lights, a three-meter braided USB-C cable, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a comfortable ergonomic 6.28-degree wrist slope on its surface to prevent fatigue. It also includes L3 and R3 buttons that the Pro FS models lacked, while naturally including a tournament lock switch to disable all the other buttons on the top bar. Where the Pro KO really stands out from the other contenders vying to be one of the best fight sticks is just how customizable its buttons are, with the space for 16 mappable and movable buttons compared to the default 12 of other leverless controllers. With spare buttons provided within the shell of the controller, an easy-to-pop-open cover, and tweezers that make changing buttons accessible straight out of the box, it's an easily customizable controller where you can add and program new buttons that are most comfortable to reach for your play style. Being available at a better comparable price to similar options at launch makes it an excellent choice for players looking to convert to a leverless control style. While fighting pros will praise leverless controllers as more precise and immediate compared to a traditional arcade stick, it's still not the superior option without retraining muscle memory and getting used to the layout, even if being able to add a different place for the up / jump button can help with the adjustment. But for those prepared to put in the work and make the transition, the Pro KO is the best leverless controller to make that move. Launching in December 2024, the price point of the Victrix Pro KO is about right for other leverless controllers right now. It's much cheaper than the Victrix Pro FS-12 and better priced than its closest competitor the Razer Kitsune, which launched at $299, making it a relative bargain considering the wealth of additional customization offered out of the box. For pad players looking to take their fighting game prowess to the next level, the Victrix Pro KO is definitely a better price choice than shelling out for its premium arcade stick equivalent the Victrix Pro FS, which is among the most expensive fight sticks at the moment (it is however still my stick of choice). Stock is unfortunately in short supply for the PlayStation model currently, with Amazon taking orders but warning that shipping can take anywhere from three to six months. It's likely because PS5 consoles have largely been the preferred platform for tournaments, but if you're predominantly playing on PC then you might be better off going for the Xbox version, which is more widely available. Price $249.99 / £229.99 / AU$399.95 Dimensions 13.35 x 9.23 x 0.8in / 23.5 x 33.53 x 2.24cm Weight 2.7lbs / 1.225kg Compatibility PS5, PS4, PC or Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC Connection type Wired (USB-C) Buttons Cheery MX Speed Silver RGB Customization Buttons Software N/A Compared to Victrix's previous attempt at a leverless controller with the Pro FS-12, which essentially kept the same bulk and weight of its Pro FS arcade stick, the Pro KO is a substantial improvement, leveraging the leverless controller's strength as a lighter and more compact option. While its dimensions are still larger than competitors like the Razer Kitsune, it's still a comfortable size for taking to tournaments, slipping neatly into my laptop bag, or the strap bars on the side give you the option to add shoulder straps. The extra real estate is important for your hands though, as the surface incorporates a 6.28° wrist slope just like with Victrix's Pro FS models, which does wonders for preventing fatigue when playing for lengthy sessions. There are also more buttons on the top including dedicated L3 and R3 buttons while the PlayStation version includes the DualSense touchpad on the top left corner, all of which can be disabled with a tournament lock switch on the top-right corner to prevent accidentally pressing them during a heated tournament match. The 24-millimeter buttons are smaller than typical arcade sticks but the same size as other leverless designs, along with the single 30-millimeter button for the up / jump button that's designed to be within reach of your thumb, similar to a space bar. It's not the only comparison to a keyboard as the buttons are also comprised of Cherry MX Speed Silver RGB switches used in mechanical keyboards, making these buttons just as tactile and responsive as Sanwa Denshi buttons favored by professional fighting game players. While the controller has 12 buttons by default, what you'll notice are four other indents (one to the left of the directional buttons, two below the usual command buttons, and one to the left of the up/jump button) where other buttons can be added. These aren't optional extras, for when you pop out the top cover, by flicking the four switches beneath the controller base, you'll find that it snugly fits four spare buttons and switches, as well as a pair of tweezers that make it easy to remove the round caps and then add new buttons, or even replace a faulty button. Once added, you simply need to hold the function button on the top bar and then choose the button you want to map the new button to. It's just as easy to customize the color lighting for the button rings, while also adjusting the mode from static to breathing, prismatic, or you can simply turn them off if you prefer. When it comes down to it, the reason to own the Victrix Pro KO is because of how much more responsive and reliable just tapping directional inputs is than with a stick. In Street Fighter 6, instead of fumbling two-quarter circles to perform a super, I just need to tap down, forward, down forward, while a charge attack is more immediate if you're just tapping the button instead of moving the stick and back and forth, which may all seem like tiny fractions of milliseconds of a difference, but in any competitive environment, those all count. Arcade purists may sniff at these controllers, which had also caught controversy for being potentially too advantageous, leading to a few instances of leverless controllers being banned at some tournaments, not to mention that the Victrix Pro KO lacks Sanwa Denshi parts that the Pro FS-12 has. Yet in terms of tactility, the Cherry switches were every bit as clickable and responsive in my testing. If you're very new to leverless controllers, however, you shouldn't take them as an immediately superior controller compared to other existing options. Using buttons for directions intrinsically requires different muscle memory from using a stick - it's about the placement of your fingers and thumb over all the directional inputs rather than your thumb on a pad or your whole arm when using a stick. Personally, I still find it difficult to adjust to having the up / jump button located at the bottom, even though it's actually where you would expect a space bar to be, and so I found myself less capable of utilizing aerial moves. While there is arguably more precision in button inputs, that's only without factoring in pressure during an actual match. It's one thing to flawlessly execute supers in training mode but against an online opponent, I would still find myself tapping the inputs too fast incorrectly in the same way I can fluff the same inputs with a joystick. Nonetheless, as far as it goes to learning leverless controls, I found the Victrix Pro KO's button layout better than when I had previously tried the Razer Kitsune, which was a little more spread out and caused my left hand to cramp when trying to keep each digit over a respective directional button. The customizable button placements also greatly help with the adjustment. In my case, adding another jump button further to the left felt more reachable for my thumb, while adding another button just under the other attack buttons meant I could program a one-button parry that's far easier to reach. Ultimately, while I see myself improving in leverless controls the more I'm using the Victrix Pro KO, I'm still not confident in having it replace my Victrix Pro FS stick as my controller of choice at the next local tournament. After swapping back to a stick, I was simply more comfortable with a mix of air-to-air follow-ups that my brain had been struggling to compute with buttons- alone. If you however don't already have decades of arcade fighting game experience lodged in your brain and are also used to playing games with a keyboard, then going leverless is likely going to feel like a natural progression. You want one of the most customizable leverless controllers aroundLeverless controllers are already touted for their more responsive performance you have an even greater advantage by being able to easily add and program more buttons right out of the box. You want the same features as the Victrix sticks but with a lighter form factorThe Victrix Pro KO has a lighter and sleeker form factor comparable to other leverless controllers but still has the same great features as its fellow Victrix sticks such as the ergonomic wrist slope and the option to add a shoulder strap for carrying it around. You're expecting a superior controller overnightLeverless controllers may offer more precise and responsive inputs in theory but it also requires a lot of practice and mental rewiring if you've been used to arcade sticks or gamepads for many years. But much like with fighting games, it's all about practice.

Just be warned of its weight, size, and the need to spend more on extra compatible cables. For more information, check out our full Octopus Arcade Stick review With Street Fighter 6 being my regular fighting game fixture on the PS5, I swapped out my dependable Victrix Pro FS for the Victrix Pro KO for a week, though occasionally swapping back to get a comparison on the different feel of each controller. Firstly practicing offline with the newly added character Mai I gradually took the courage to adapt to leverless controls against other online opponents, getting my fair share of wins but also plenty of defeats, and making note of where I felt an improvement in using this controller and what felt like new limitations. I also played some matches while using the controller's audio jack with my Corsair Virtuoso Pro wired headset. On my gaming PC, I was able to test it out on the newly released Virtua Fighter 5 REVO, where I also started with some practice in arcade mode before attempting to take it online and making some progress in ranked matches. This was however an easier adjustment from Street Fighter 6 owing to fewer inputs while the up button is used less for jumping and more for side-stepping. Overall, I played around 8-10 hours with the Victrix Pro KO between both games, though arguably more so on Street Fighter 6 because it really is the best.

Title: Uranium is in the crosshairs of the US-Canada tariff battle

Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. Nuclear power plants in the US get a lot of uranium from Canada and prices could rise with tariffs. by Justine Calma If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats could raise the price of uranium used to fuel US nuclear reactors, which could have ripple effects on a tenuous nuclear renaissance spurred by the growth of energy-hungry data centers. The US gets more than a quarter of its uranium from Canada, more than from any other country. The Trump administration imposed new tariffs on uranium and other goods on Canada this week, which he soon paused after a stock market drop and sell-off. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply It’s too soon to know what the exact impact would be on the US’s nuclear energy industry if tariffs move forward. It could play into efforts to build up a domestic uranium supply, which has gotten bipartisan support and interest from major tech companies. But in the near term, the US still relies on its northern neighbor to keep reactors running. Trump proposed a 10 percent tariff on energy products from Canada, but he announced yesterday that it would be paused until at least April 2nd. Canada-based Cameco, one of the world’s biggest uranium producers, warned that the tariffs would inevitably lead to higher prices. “It’s kind of Econ 101 to figure out what the impact of tariffs are in this situation,” Cameco CFO Grant Isaac said in a February 20th earnings call. A 10 percent tariff would lead to a 10 percent rise in uranium prices, Isaac said, whether that’s from Canada or elsewhere. “History tells us non-tariff countries will simply increase their offer prices to just under 10 percent,” he said. When reached for comment this week, a spokesperson for Cameco said Isaac’s comments on the call still hold. The Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association based in Washington, DC, was coy when asked about how the tariffs might affect the US nuclear energy industry. “We agree in principle that actions should be taken to unleash America’s energy dominance and protect our national security, while also creating a robust economy that spurs job creation. However, these measures could hinder growth and innovation in the energy sector and the nations’ ability to achieve energy dominance,” Doug True, senior vice president of technical and regulatory services and chief nuclear officer, said in an emailed statement. Uranium prices have risen dramatically in recent years, with growing interest in nuclear energy — including from Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta seeking out nuclear energy to power new AI data centers. Higher uranium prices incentivized the resurgence of uranium mining in the US, with the first mine to open in nearly a decade starting up near the Grand Canyon last year. The Russia-Ukraine war is another factor, with the Biden administration banning uranium imports from Russia, another major supplier, last year. “Why are we dependent on foreign nations when the US has the capability, has the resources, has the technology to actually become energy independent, especially in nuclear?” says Jay Yu, president of LIS Technologies, a US-based laser uranium enrichment company. But even if the US builds up its domestic supply chain, it’s still constrained by geography. The US only holds about 1 percent of the world’s uranium reserves, while Canada holds about 10 times as much. “Tariffs would threaten uranium supply at a time when the United States is seeking to expand its nuclear dominance,” Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a late January analysis. The emergence of DeepSeek’s AI models in China, which can ostensibly use much less energy than US rivals, has also made the future of data center energy use and nuclear energy more uncertain. Nuclear energy is still a touchy subject that’s created some strange bedfellows. Unlike coal and gas power plants, nuclear reactors don’t generate greenhouse gas emissions. That’s put it on the table as an alternative to fossil fuels that some climate hawks champion. But someone has to mine the uranium for those nuclear reactors, which some environmental groups and Indigenous activists are fighting fervently. The US has a history of uranium mines contaminating water resources on Navajo Nation land. Trump, a big fan of the fossil fuel industry that dumped tens of millions of dollars into his campaign, has essentially tried to eradicate action on the climate crisis in the US. He could carve out exceptions for nuclear energy technologies that have garnered support from extractive industries and Big Tech. He tapped Chris Wright to lead the Energy Department; Wright was previously the CEO of a major oil and gas service provider and sat on the board of directors for a company developing advanced nuclear reactors with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Uranium sits at the nexus of many different power plays in the US, and tariffs could raise the stakes for everyone with something to lose or gain.

Title: Stock investors are hovering near a make-or-break level in the market

Time Published: 2025-03-07T15:40:14Z

The stock market has entered the danger zone as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 hover near their 200-day moving averages. Both indexes are trading at the key technical support level after a 6% decline in the S&P 500 and a 9% sell-off in the Nasdaq 100 since mid-February. The 200-day moving average is a closely watched technical indicator that helps identify the long-term direction of a trend. When securities fall below their 200-day moving average, it sends a warning to traders that the prior uptrend in price could be on the verge of reversing course and establishing a downtrend. The Nasdaq 100 closed below its 200-day moving average on Thursday for the first time since March 2023, while the S&P 500 tested the level multiple times this week for the first time since October 2023. As of Friday morning, the S&P 500 is trading at 5,728.90, just a few points below its 200-day moving average of 5,732, while the Nasdaq 100 is trading at 20,056.35, below its 200-day moving average of 20,246.83. It's a potentially make-or-break moment for the stock market as traders assess the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies. According to technical analyst Katie Stockton of Fairlead Strategies, the S&P 500 needs to stage a decisive bounce above this technical level to prevent further downside. "Our short-term indicators suggest it will act as a staging ground for a brief oversold bounce," Stockton told clients in a note on Friday. "Nevertheless, a close below 5,783 today would leave a breakdown pending confirmation next Friday." Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, told Business Insider that he wouldn't be surprised if big-money buyers started to enter the market. "These longer-term trendlines can be used by institutions to buy up shares, so we'd expect to see some type of potential buying down around here," Detrick said, adding that this correction in the stock market is perfectly normal, especially after the back-to-back years of 20%+ gains in 2023 and 2024. "We remain overweight equities and would use it as an opportunity to accumulate solid companies at a discount. After gaining 20% two years in a row, some consolidation early this year makes a lot of sense," Detrick said. Adam Turnquist, chief technical strategist at LPL Financial, highlighted in a note this week that an index that equally weights the Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech stocks — Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Amazon, Microsoft, and Tesla — is also trading at its 200-day moving average. If it falls below the threshold, it would suggest investors should look elsewhere for leadership in the stock market. "A violation of the 200-dma would imply that the Mag Seven's leadership status has been revoked," Turnquist said. For David Keller, chief strategist at Sierra Alpha Research, traders should be on watch for a more painful decline in stock prices. Keller told BI that a confirmed breakdown below the 5,700 level in the S&P 500 would suggest that the index could test support at 5,500, representing potential downside of about 4% from current levels.

Title: Elon Musk's wealth tanks by $102 billion in 2 months as Tesla stock hits the skids
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-wealth-tesla-stock-price-trump-billionaires-ev-doge-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-07T11:39:35Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk's net worth has tumbled by $102 billion this year following a sharp decline in Tesla stock. That figure is about the same as the United Parcel Service's entire market value. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's wealth has shrunk by about 24% in under 10 weeks to $330 billion at Thursday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Musk is still comfortably the world's richest person, with a roughly $108 billion lead over second-place Jeff Bezos, despite being the biggest wealth loser this year. He's well ahead of Michael Dell, whose net worth is down $20 billion. Musk's fortune has been hit by a 35% plunge in Tesla's share price this year, from about $404 to $263. The sell-off has cut its market value by more than $400 billion to under $900 billion. Investors have dumped the automaker's stock for several reasons. Musk spent more than $250 million to help Donald Trump get reelected, stumped at the Republican candidate's rallies, and marshaled his X followers to vote for Trump in November's election. The tech billionaire has remained a close advisor since Trump's victory, spearheading efforts to streamline federal spending with his White House DOGE office. The combination of his divisive politics, concerns about his new role distracting from his CEO duties, and reports of Tesla sales declines in several countries have weighed on the company's shares. Several other members of the $100 billion club have taken a hit to their fortunes from the recent slump in stocks, which has been fueled by worries that Trump's tariffs and government cuts will cool economic growth or even cause a recession. Oracle's Larry Ellison has had $19 billion wiped off his wealth, reducing it to $173 billion. Similarly, Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Amazon's Bezos have each had about $17 billion erased from their respective net worths this year. Bezos is now tied with Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg on $222 billion; Zuckerberg has added $14 billion to his wealth in 2025, while the Amazon founder has shed almost $17 billion. Jump to

UPDATED 06:33 EST / MARCH 07 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business.

Title: STEVE FORBES: Truth or consequences: what happens when businesses end DEI

Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com. Target is the latest in a string of retail giants who have taken a stance against the wildly unpopular diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs afflicting corporate America. Target’s move comes in the wake of similar action by other big-name companies, including Meta, Walmart, Amazon and Tractor Supply Co., which have all scaled back their DEI policies in recent months. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. Walmart investors recently sent a letter to company leadership applauding them for rolling back their anti-business DEI policies and encouraging them to maintain their position despite far-left pushback. TARGET FACES 40-DAY BOYCOTT FOR ROLLING BACK DEI INITIATIVES Indeed, DEI policies and force-fed corporate moralism have been wildly unpopular with the American public since their inception. When Tractor Supply’s DEI policies came to light last year, they drew massive attention on social media and inspired customers to boycott the company, resulting in an 8% decrease in its stock price ($2.8 billion in market loss) over just five days. Continued exposure of corporate DEI programs caused other large companies like Ford, Google and Lowe’s to preemptively shut down their policies and avoid similar backlash and financial loss. Target said it is taking aim at DEI, one of several major companies to do so. (Google Maps) Additionally, large companies have faced consistent warnings of potential legal action from state attorneys general, private organizations and shareholders over what amounted to discriminatory DEI hiring practices in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2023 Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College (SFFA) decision. And back in 2016, when Target first announced its bathroom policy allowing customers to use restrooms based on gender identity, it triggered a massive backlash and boycotts. They could not have been more out of touch with the American public. These efforts, as well as the larger campaign by angry DEI supporters to "blackout" Amazon, Walmart, Nestle and other large corporations, represent just how far the Democrat party has come from reflecting the views of the American people. Even their own pundits and politicians agree. Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg recently blasted the comical DNC Chair election and went as far as jabbing at DEI, which he described as often "making people sit through a training that looks like something out of ‘Portlandia.’" Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner also admitted that his party’s "over-the-top-wokeism" has hurt their political prospects. Longtime Democratic Party strategist James Carville lamented his party’s self-destruction over essentially meaningless, in his words "stunningly stupid," policies, including the Democratic National Committee’s woke gender rules implemented in February. The shift is a welcome sign that companies may finally be listening to their customers and shareholders, who have grown weary of paying the high price for businesses’ capitulation to the woke agenda. And former White House press secretary Jen Psaki recently decried the Democrats’ approach to dialogue with the public, noting how detached they are from everyday citizens and the issues that matter most to them. The truth is corporate moralism has damaged American consumers, and they know it. DEI, alongside environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives, have unnecessarily raised the prices of energy, food, transportation, and housing. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Americans want businesses to get back to focusing on their bottom line: delivering reliable, affordable, and high-quality products to customers. DEI policies are simply bad for the economy, bad for the consumer, and bad for the moral fabric of this country. Walmart is one of several major retailers that have backed off of its DEI efforts. FILE: Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio (Google Maps) Government, social groups and companies should not evangelize consumers with the left’s woke agenda – such tactics are ineffective, unprofitable and off-putting. Amid the progressive left’s cries for social justice and a corporate facade of diversity, equity and inclusion, the true purpose of business in a free society has been lost. Businesses do not provide moral or political guidance, nor should they. They exist to facilitate an exchange of goods and services and to compete with other companies for a profit by making themselves more appealing, whether through better quality or lower cost. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Thankfully, American businesses are waking up to this reality, and the huge house of cards of corporate DEI may be on its way to a final, fatal fall. At the very least, we seem to be seeing an encouraging shift and a step in the right direction. Let’s hope the trend continues, and at long last, American companies can finally get back to business.

The stock market tariff tantrum of the past few weeks has seen the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 give up all their gains since the early November election victory of Donald Trump even as bitcoin (BTC) remains in positive territory. Both equity gauges are now more than 2% lower, while bitcoin is up over 20% in the same time frame. Market leader Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips are in demand for uses in AI, for instance, is lower by more than 20% since Trump's triumph. On the flip side, Meta Platforms (META) is the stand out stock in the so-called magnificent seven technology companies having gained about 10%. While bitcoin buyer Strategy (MSTR) is down over 50% from its all-time high in November, it remains up 20% since the election. Though bitcoin bulls are surely disappointed in the price performance of late — the world's largest cryptocurrency has slumped about 20% from $109,000 the day before Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20 — the current price of $88,000 is still up roughly 20% from its level just prior to the November election.

Title: Alliance Witan PLC - Final Results

March 07, 2025 02:00 ET | Source: Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan PLC (‘the Company’)LEI: 213800SZZD4E2IOZ9W55 7 March 2025 A landmark year Annual results for the year ended 31 December 2024 Highlights Dean Buckley, Chair of Alliance Witan, commented: “The Company delivered strong outright gains for shareholders in 2024, although in common with most active global equity strategies, we underperformed our benchmark index, MSCI ACWI, where performance was concentrated in a handful of the largest US companies. Even so, the Company’s longer-term performance remains competitive, and demand for our shares was healthy last year, with the Company's discount narrowing, bucking the industry trend towards widening discounts. We also increased our dividend for the 58th consecutive year. “Thanks to the support of both sets of shareholders, we achieved a historic combination with Witan, which places the Company in a strong position to realise economies of scale and offer better liquidity for our shares. With solid performance and a refreshed brand, supported by a marketing campaign that will continue in 2025, the Board is confident that the Company is well placed to continue delivering attractive returns for shareholders”. About Alliance Witan PLC Alliance Witan aims to be a core investment that beats inflation over the long term through a combination of capital growth and rising dividend. The Company invests in global equities across a wide range of different sectors and industries to achieve its objective. Alliance Witan’s portfolio uses a distinctive multi-manager approach. We blend the top stock selections of some of the world’s best active managers into a single diversified portfolio designed to outperform the market while carefully managing risk. Alliance Witan is an AIC Dividend Hero with 58 consecutive years of rising dividends. https://www.alliancewitan.com For more information, please contact: 1. Alternative Performance Measure. Share Price Total Return is the return to shareholders through share price capital returns and dividends paid by the Company and re-invested. Net Asset Value (NAV) Total Return is a measure of the performance of the Company’s NAV over a specified time period. It combines any change in the NAV and dividends paid.

Notes: NAV per Share including income with debt at fair value. NAV Total Return based on NAV including income with debt at fair value and after all costs. Source: Morningstar and Juniper Partners Limited (‘Juniper’). Chair’s Statement 2024 was a landmark year for your Company. I would like to begin by thanking you for your support for the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to form Alliance Witan and by welcoming all shareholders who have joined us as a result. This was a pivotal moment in our history, achieving economies of scale and elevating the Company to the FTSE 100. Now, as one of the industry’s leaders, this status will provide better liquidity for our shares and, with good long term investment performance and a strong brand, help us attract new investors. We made a number of commitments to investors as part of the proposals, for example in respect of dividends and costs, and you will see as you read through the Annual Report how we have achieved each of these. As I mentioned in the Interim Report for the six months ended 30 June 2024, there has been no change to the Company’s investment strategy, just a larger pool of assets for our Investment Manager, WTW, to manage with the same professionalism that it has brought to the job since April 2017. 1. https://www.theaic.co.uk/aic/news/press-releases/top-20-best-performing-investment-trusts-for-your-isa Investment Performance It was another good year for global equity markets, and your Company delivered strong absolute returns. NAV Total Return was 13.3% and, due to a narrowing of the discount, Share Price Total Return was 14.3%. However, we lagged our benchmark index, the MSCI All Country World Index (‘MSCI ACWI’ or ‘Index’), which returned 19.6%. We also marginally underperformed our peers in the AIC Global Sector, which is disappointing, but we were slightly ahead of the much wider, more representative Morningstar peer group of open and closed-ended global equity funds. Simply put, our relative performance in 2024 suffered from not having enough exposure to the small number of very large companies that dominated market returns, especially in the US. The narrowness of returns from global equity markets has been a common problem for all active managers in recent years, and we take comfort from the fact that, despite this persistent headwind, we are ahead of the Index and have significantly outperformed both peer groups over three years. You can read more about the contributors/detractors to the Company’s investment performance during 2024 in the Investment Manager’s Report on page 9 of the Annual Report. Dividend increased for the 58th consecutive year The Board declared a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per share on 28 January 2025, resulting in a full year dividend of 26.70p, an increase of 6.0% on the prior year. This fulfils the promise we made at the time of the combination of Alliance Trust and Witan to increase dividends for the legacy shareholders of both companies. 2024’s increase marks the 58th consecutive annual increase, which is one of the longest track records in the investment trust industry. Dividends are well supported by revenue and reserves, and the Board is confident annual dividend increases can continue well into the future. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Narrowing discount Many investment trusts continued to trade on large discounts to NAV throughout 2024, with the industry average widening to 14.7% from 12.7%.1 I am pleased to report that your Company fared better than most, with its average discount falling to 4.7% from 5.4% over the year. This compared favourably with the average discount for the AIC Global Sector of 7.9%. Your Board remains committed to the maintenance of a stable discount. We will continue to use share buybacks as appropriate and invest in promotional activity to widen our shareholder base, to support the management of the discount. During 2024, the Company bought back 4.7 million shares (1.2% of shares in issue2), versus 8.6 million repurchased in 2023. The shares bought back during the year were placed in Treasury. This level of buybacks was significantly below that of our peers, in a year in which industry-wide buybacks hit a record level of £7.5 billion3. The shares held in Treasury can be reissued by the Company at a premium to estimated NAV when there is market demand. Board changes Following the completion of the combination of Alliance Trust with Witan, we welcomed four new Non-Executive Directors to the Board: Andrew Ross, Rachel Beagles, Shauna Bevan and Jack Perry, all of whom were former directors of Witan. Clare Dobie, having served for almost nine years, is retiring as a Director at the conclusion of this year’s Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’), as is Jack Perry, reducing the size of the Board to eight members. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Clare and Jack for their contributions. Annual General Meeting The Board looks forward to being able to meet shareholders again at this year’s AGM, which will be held at the Apex City Quay Hotel in Dundee on 1 May 2025. For those shareholders who are not able to attend in person, we will be live streaming the event. As well as the formal business of the meeting, there will be an investor forum afterwards featuring two of our Stock Pickers, Jennison and EdgePoint, as well as members of WTW’s investment team. There will be another in-person investor forum in London in the autumn. In addition, shareholders can engage with the Company and its Stock Pickers via online presentations during the year. Further details of how to attend all these events can be found on the website. The Board would strongly encourage shareholders to use the opportunity to have their say and use their vote at the AGM. Further information on the arrangements for the AGM, including information on how to vote either directly through the Registrar or though different platforms, is on pages 134 and 135 of the Annual Report. Keep up-to-date In these unusual times, the website will provide timely updates to shareholders. Therefore, I would encourage you to visit the website which contains a vast amount of information on investment performance, details of shareholder meetings and investor forums, monthly factsheets, quarterly newsletters, and Stock Picker updates, as well as the Annual and Interim Reports. As always, the Board welcomes communication from shareholders and I can be contacted through Juniper Partners (‘Juniper’), the Company Secretary at investor@alliancewitan.com. Outlook Since the start of President Trump’s second term of office in January, tariffs have created uncertainty about the outlook for equities. Diplomatic tensions over efforts to end the war in Ukraine and conflict in Gaza have also raised geopolitical risks. Furthermore, European bond markets are adjusting to the prospect of increased borrowing to fund higher levels of defence and infrastructure spending. While there is a risk that heightened levels of uncertainty will impact on business and consumer confidence, global growth and corporate earnings forecasts are currently healthy, giving some grounds for cautious optimism, about further gains for shareholders, especially if there is a broadening out of market leadership. While the Index is highly concentrated, your portfolio has broader exposure to many good businesses that have not yet received the market recognition our Stock Pickers believe they deserve. The portfolio will not always outperform the market in every discrete period, but we believe it will continue to add significant value for shareholders in the long run. I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at the AGM in Dundee or the next investor forum in London. 1. Weighted average discount (excluding 3i Group). Source: Winterflood. 2.

Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Combination with Witan The most significant development during the year under review was the combination of the Company with Witan. Background Following a comprehensive review of management arrangements, the Witan Board concluded that a combination with the Company was in the best interests of Witan’s shareholders. Amongst other things this allowed them continued exposure to a successful multi-manager approach. The combination was undertaken by way of a scheme of reconstruction and members’ voluntary liquidation of Witan. The scheme required the approval of both the Company and Witan’s shareholders and took effect on 10 October 2024. It resulted in the Company acquiring approximately £1,539 million of net assets from Witan in consideration for the issue of new ordinary shares to Witan shareholders. The name of the Company became Alliance Witan and the stock exchange ticker ALW. Outcome The combination was expected to result in substantial benefits for all shareholders and future investors. The outcomes of the key elements of the proposals include: Portfolio Transition Investment Manager’s Report Market backdrop: equities untroubled by politics For the second year running, global equities delivered strong returns in 2024, with economics trumping politics. Despite a record number of elections, conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine reaching new heights, and a scary moment in Japan when the Nikkei Index of the top 225 blue-chip shares plunged 12% in a day at the beginning of August, investors focused on resilient global growth, falling inflation and interest rates, and healthy corporate profitability. Hence, our benchmark index, the MSCI ACWI, returned 19.6% in 2024 following a return of 15.3% in 2023. Since 1987, the Index has returned an average of 8.4% per annum1, so returns of this magnitude in two consecutive years are rare. The ebullient mood of equity investors was reflected in a surge in the prices of less established assets, such as cryptocurrency, with Bitcoin reaching all-time highs of over $100,000. Peanut the Squirrel Coin, a cryptocurrency named after the eponymous pet that New York environmental authorities seized and euthanised on 30 October 2024, at one point commanded a market cap of $1.7 billion. However, regional equity market performance was mixed. US markets once again led the way, with the S&P 500 delivering a 27% return when measured in British pounds. Chinese equities rallied briefly following government stimulus, but concerns over the country’s property market and trade tensions persisted. Together with a strong US dollar, these worries led to more subdued returns from emerging markets, which rose about 9%. In Japan, August’s technically driven decline proved temporary, and the Nikkei resumed its ascent to close the year at a record high, although the yen’s depreciation reduced returns for UK-based investors when converted into British pounds. The UK and European markets were more muted, with the FTSE All Share Index and the MSCI Europe ex UK Index returning 9.5% and 1.9% respectively. Gains driven by US tech giants Giant US technology related stocks were the standout performers, fuelled by investor excitement about generative artificial intelligence (‘AI’) and, from November onwards, hopes that Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election would weaken regulatory scrutiny. The share prices of the so called “Magnificent Seven” – Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla – increased by 60% on average and were responsible for 43% of MSCI ACWI’s gains. This was less than 2023 when they contributed 53%, but still a huge number emphasising the extreme concentration of index returns in a small number of companies. Even so, from mid-year onwards, returns were no longer quite as skewed to the performance of a handful of shares. Although NVIDIA and Tesla returned a massive 176% and 65% respectively, giant tech was not the only game in town. Financial stocks returned 26.5%, and returns from the consumer discretionary, industrial and utility sectors were also well into double figures, pointing to the potential broadening out of market returns as stock-specific drivers came to the fore. 1. https://www.msci.com/documents/10199/8d97d244-4685-4200-a24c-3e2942e3adeb Portfolio performance: strong absolute gains but lagged benchmark index Our portfolio’s NAV Total Return was a robust 13.3% but, as with most active managers, it lagged the Company’s benchmark index. The portfolio does, however, remain ahead of the Index over three years (28.0% vs 26.8%), albeit behind over five years (64.7% vs 70.8%). Disappointing though it was not to beat the MSCI ACWI in 2024, we were not alone. AJ Bell calculated that, to the end of November, just 18% of active global equity funds outperformed their passive peers, largely due to their inability to match high Index weightings in the “Magnificent Seven”. The sheer size of these companies in the Index is mind boggling. NVIDIA, Microsoft and Apple, for example, represent 13% of the MSCI ACWI as at 31 December 2024 and, together, are bigger than the entire stock markets of several sizeable countries. The skew of the Index towards mega-cap companies has been a challenge, to varying degrees, since the start of our multi-manager strategy in April 2017. As a broadly diversified strategy, with capital spread between 8-12 Managers, all with different approaches to investing, our portfolio naturally has a structural bias away from stocks that on rare occasions represent such a large proportion of our global benchmark. While we have some exposure to most of the “Magnificent Seven”, it would require a lot of the Managers to choose them as one of their best ideas for us to be at Index weight, never mind be overweight. The Index may have been hard to beat in recent years, but market concentration poses significant risks for passive strategies. At the end of 2024, the Index on average allocated around 150 times as much capital to each of Apple, NVIDIA and Microsoft as it did to the average stock, akin to us placing about 95% of the portfolio in one manager’s hands and 0.5% each in the other ten. We do not believe this is the right way to manage risk for shareholders, bearing in mind that index trackers are not investing lots of money in these companies because they are good businesses trading at good valuations, but because they are very big. If US large-cap stocks continue to dominate, tracker funds may continue to outperform active funds. But if sentiment on the technology sector turns sour, passive funds with big stakes will be hit much harder. Not owning enough NVIDIA was painful The strong outperformance of our portfolio versus our benchmark in 2023 continued into the first quarter of 2024, when the biggest contribution came from not owning, at that time, poorly performing Tesla and Apple. But thereafter stock selection became more challenging, particularly within the “Magnificent Seven”. Although we benefitted from owning Amazon and Microsoft, we moved from an overweight to an underweight position in NVIDIA in the first quarter after its extraordinary outperformance, which then made it our biggest single detractor last year as that outperformance continued. Having helped us in the first quarter, the lack of exposure to Tesla and Apple, which both recovered strongly as the year progressed, counted against us from then on. Overall, our positions in the “Magnificent Seven” accounted for a third of the portfolio’s underperformance versus the Index in 2024. The remainder of the portfolio’s underperformance came from a combination of being underweight in large-cap stocks in general and stock specific issues elsewhere, in some cases due to partial reversals of performance in 2023. For example, stock selection in financials detracted in large part due to our relative lack of exposure to strongly performing US banks such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs. In the consumer discretionary sector, the share price of UK-based drinks company Diageo, owned by Veritas Asset Management (‘Veritas’) and Metropolis Capital (‘Metropolis’), continued to suffer from a post-Covid cyclical downturn, falling 8.5%, although both Managers believe the company will eventually recover lost ground when structural trends reassert themselves. Novo Nordisk, the Danish weight loss drugs company, was another notable detractor, as its shares fell 14% after disappointing test results. Our Stock Pickers see this as a temporary decline in a growing market in which Novo Nordisk has a leading position. Hence, it was one of our biggest purchases in 2024 (see table below). Indeed, our Stock Pickers express a high degree of confidence in the latent value of many of their holdings. By far the most important long run ingredient underpinning share price performance is strong fundamentals, such as market-leading products or services, solid profit margins, plentiful cashflow and strong management. Top 10 purchases and sales Source: Juniper. The purchases and sales are calculated by taking the net value of all transactions (buy and sells) for each holding held within the portfolio over the period. The tables exclude any non-equity holdings such as ETFs and any transfers from the combination with Witan. Even so, in the short run, market sentiment can have a larger impact on share prices than fundamentals. When we break down the portfolio performance against the Index into fundamentals and sentiment, the portfolio’s strong absolute performance has been mainly as a result of company fundamentals, whereas the Index’s absolute performance has been more driven by market sentiment. A full breakdown of the contributors to our Total Return in 2024 is shown in the following table. Contribution analysis Source: Performance and attribution data sourced from WTW, Juniper, MSCI Inc, FactSet and Morningstar as at 31 December 2024. Percentages may not add due to rounding. In the table below, we also list the top five contributors and detractors to portfolio performance during the year relative to the portfolio’s benchmark. Sands, Vulcan and Lyrical were the top performers As we would expect from such a diverse line up, performance among our Managers was mixed. This is by design, as we do not want the portfolio to be biased towards any one approach of investing, which might make returns vulnerable to a sudden switch from one style to another. This happened in 2022 when growth stocks began to suffer significantly as central banks raised interest rates to combat inflation. Sands Capital (‘Sands’), Vulcan Value Partners (‘Vulcan’), and Lyrical Asset Management (‘Lyrical’) were the top performers last year. Sands and Vulcan both benefitted from owning tech giants. Sands held NVIDIA while Vulcan held Amazon, but Sands’ largest contributor to relative performance was Axon Enterprise, an industrial business which makes tasers, body cameras and other software products. Its share price surged by 134% last year. Top five stock contributors to performance Bottom five stock detractors to performance Source: WTW. The tables above illustrate the top five contributors and detractors to returns relative to benchmark in 2024. It aims to explain at a stock level which companies drove relative returns. For example, the Alliance Witan portfolio was underweight relative to benchmark in NVIDIA, Broadcom, Tesla and Apple. These stocks had very strong returns, which hurt our portfolio’s relative performance. Conversely, not having an exposure to Nestle helped our relative performance given the stock was held in the benchmark and was down over the year. Our overweight position in Amazon, Axon Enterprise, Salesforce and NRG Energy contributed positively to relative returns given their strong performance. The average active weight is the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the portfolio minus the arithmetic simple average weight of the stock in the benchmark over the period. Vulcan’s largest contributor to our performance was KKR, the US-based private equity group, which returned 82%, prompting Vulcan to take profits. Its holding in Salesforce also did well, rising nearly 30%. Lyrical, a deep-value style investor, benefitted from owning several less talked-about US-based companies, which all rebounded from cheap valuations. These included NRG Energy, Ameriprise Financials and eBay. Of our Managers, the most notable laggard was Sustainable Growth Advisors (‘SGA’), which was disappointing given its focus on large cap growth stocks which, as a group, had the strongest price momentum. SGA suffered from holding Novo Nordisk, and two of its other positions, ICON and Synopsys also stood out as detractors. The recent poor performance of SGA follows a long period of outperformance, so returns since we appointed SGA remain strong. Value Managers Metropolis and ARGA Investment Management (‘ARGA’), the latter replacing Jupiter Asset Management (‘Jupiter’) in April, also struggled in the recent market environment, which has generally favoured growth managers. Portfolio changes: two new Managers added after combination with Witan As well as adding ARGA for Jupiter in the first half of the year, following Ben Whitmore’s decision to leave Jupiter to set up his own business, there were two further changes to the Manager line-up during the integration of Witan’s portfolio. Altogether, this contributed to an unusually high level of turnover of 98.5% of the portfolio in 2024. Both Alliance Trust and Witan already had GQG Partners (‘GQG’) and Veritas in common, which meant that there were some in-specie transfers of stocks. Additionally, the combination of Alliance and Witan presented us with an opportunity to introduce Jennison Associates (‘Jennison’) to the portfolio at a low cost. Based in the US, Jennison specialises in investing in innovative, fast-growing businesses. It had been one of Witan’s most successful managers and blending it with our other Managers increased the diversity of holdings in growth companies. We also took the opportunity to replace Black Creek Investment Management (‘Black Creek’) with EdgePoint Investment Group (‘EdgePoint’), while we were using a transition manager to keep costs down to a minimum. This change was prompted by succession planning at Black Creek. We had been monitoring Black Creek for some time due to the departure of a senior team member for health reasons and the uncertainty surrounding the timing of founder Bill Kanko’s retirement. With a similar investment style to Black Creek, EdgePoint seeks to buy good, undervalued businesses and hold them until the market fully realises their potential. Through the combination, we inherited a small number of investment trust and private equity fund holdings, representing less than 3% of the combined portfolio. These are specialist funds with portfolios focused on, among other things, early-stage life sciences, valuable intellectual property, innovative internet platforms and renewable infrastructure assets. Collective investments such as these are not normally part of our investment strategy. However, they are all trading at prices we believe are well below their intrinsic value, so rather than sell them at a loss, we will hold them until we can achieve attractive values. Beyond that, the combination did not lead to any change in our investment approach. We retain high conviction in our line-up of Managers and their ability to pick winning stocks, although we keep them under constant review for any red flags and have access to a deep bench of talented replacements should these be needed. Gearing: remaining cautious Our gross gearing stood at 8.4% at the end of 2024 (4.9% net of underlying Manager and central cash), slightly above the level of 7.1% at the start of the year, reflecting the improving outlook for equities as the year progressed. However, given the strong performance from equity markets, it is still towards the lower end of the typical range of 7.5 to 12.5%. Market outlook: multiple risks warrant diversification As 2025 began, the mood among investors was upbeat, with many hoping President Trump’s promises of deregulation and tax cuts would be supportive of equity markets. If returns can spread beyond a narrow group of highly valued US mega-cap technology stocks, it could provide firmer foundations for another good year for shares. The strong start to the year for European equities certainly offered hope for geographical diversification. However, on-off tariffs and geopolitical tensions loom large, creating considerable uncertainty. This was reflected in an increase in equity market volatility in February. In the first 2 months of 2025, the benchmark index rose by 2.2% suggesting that investors were still willing to look through some of the risks while forecast global growth and corporate earnings remain healthy. But confidence is fragile and, with valuations in the US still close to a record high despite February’s pullback, the market is vulnerable to setbacks. In this environment, we believe bottom-up stock picking, based on company fundamentals, should be a more reliable way to add value for shareholders in the long term than making bold, top-down market calls. So, we will continue to position the portfolio to maintain balanced regional, sector and style exposures, that are similar to the Index weightings by periodically adjusting Manager allocations. This should provide stability and reduce risk, while we rely on our Managers to add value by seeking out the best companies in each market segment. While retaining some exposure to US mega-cap tech stocks that may continue delivering attractive returns, our portfolio is not reliant on them. It also contains many stocks that have remained in the shadows but have been performing well operationally and have excellent prospects not yet reflected in their share prices. Hidden gems: stock picks with high potential We asked our eleven Stock Pickers for examples of strong but underappreciated companies in the portfolio Lyrical highlighted five of its US holdings that have underperformed the S&P 500 Index since the start of 2024 but, at the same time, have grown their forecast earnings per share by more than the Index. These are healthcare providers Cigna and HCA, WEX and Global Payments, which both provide business-to-business payment technology, and Gen Digital, which is a leading provider of cyber security and identity protection. “Interestingly, even on this list there is inconsistency by the market,” says Lyrical. “Cigna has the worst stock performance, but the second-best earnings per share (‘EPS’) growth. Gen Digital has the slowest EPS growth in the group, but the best performance”. ARGA cited Accor, the global hotel business, which has transitioned to an “asset light” business model by selling most of its hotels, while maintaining the lucrative franchise and management agreements attached to these properties. While Sands Capital sees potential in the share prices of Sika, a maintenance and building refurbishment specialist. “Investment results have been weak despite solid fundamental results,” says Sands. “We believe that investors have focused on slower than historical organic growth, caused by several factors, including the real estate crisis in China, slowdown in electric vehicle production, and a pause in green building incentives.” Sands Capital also mentioned Roper Technologies, a diversified industrial technology company, and Keyence, a leading designer of high-end factory automation based in Japan, as attractive businesses with share price appreciation potential. Vulcan highlighted CoStar Group, an information provider to the commercial and residential real estate industries, and Everest Group, a global insurance and reinsurance business, while GQG mentioned the UK-based pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, the Brazil-based oil and gas company Petrobras, Bank Mandiri in Indonesia, and the Indian tobacco company ITC. SGA backed Danaher, the US industrial group, Intuit, which provides do-it-yourself accounting software for small businesses, and HDFC Bank in India. Jennison highlighted Reddit, the online social media platform. “Reddit is targeting 49% growth in the third quarter of 2024 and consensus is at 41% in Q4, but then market estimates are fading down to around 20% in 2025, which we think is overly conservative and creates an opportunity for investment today.” Veritas’s nominations for underappreciated businesses were Amadeus, the Spanish software company focusing on air travel, The Cooper Companies, which makes contact lenses, and Thermo Fisher Scientific, the world’s largest scientific equipment provider. Japan specialist Dalton’s best stocks included Bandai Namco, a multinational that publishes video games and makes toys, Shimano, the bicycle equipment manufacturer, and Rinnai, one of the global leaders in water heaters. Metropolis highlighted Andritz, the Austrian headquartered business supplying industrial equipment to the pulp and paper, metals and hydropower industries, Crown Holdings, which makes aluminium drinks cans, and Admiral, the UK insurer. Finally, EdgePoint, the newest addition to our Manager line-up, pointed to Dayforce, a global human resources software company, Nippon Paints Holdings in Japan, Franco-Nevada, a gold-focused royalty company in Canada, and Qualcomm, which invented significant pieces of the underlying technology required for mobile phones. “The market looks at Qualcomm as a handset supplier and the stock moves in relation to expected handset sales over the following quarters,” says EdgePoint. “We consider Qualcomm to be one of the world’s leading designers of energy-efficient processors at a point in time when demand for energy-efficient processing is growing rapidly across a wide range of industries. Some of the major opportunities for Qualcomm over the next 5 years include artificial intelligence, automobiles, personal computers and smartphones.” Altogether, these fundamentally strong businesses combine with others to create a robust, multi-manager portfolio that offers attractive long-term growth with lower risk than a single manager strategy, and therefore a more comfortable ride through the ups and downs of the market. Such companies may have remained below the radar in 2024, when investors became giddy with the stellar returns from the US technology shares, but we look forward to their attributes receiving the recognition from the market that they deserve.

Dividend We have paid our shareholders a rising dividend for 58 consecutive years. Providing that level of reliability is something of which we are extremely proud. We carefully manage the Company’s dividend. For instance, should there be a year in which income is unexpectedly high, we may retain some of that income to help fund future dividends. Due to our steady approach, the Company has received a ‘Dividend Hero’ investment company award from the Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’). Our dividend policy Subject to market conditions and the Company’s performance, financial position and outlook, the Board will seek to pay a dividend that increases year on year. The Company expects to pay four interim dividends per year, on or around the last day of June, September, December and March, and will not, generally, pay a final dividend for a particular financial year. While shareholders are not asked to approve a final dividend, given the timing of the payment of the quarterly payments, each year they are given the opportunity to share their views when they are asked to approve the Company’s Dividend Policy. Fourth interim dividend As previously announced, a fourth interim dividend of 6.73p per ordinary share will be paid on 31 March 2025 to those shareholders who were on the register at close of business on 28 February 2025. Increased dividend The Company has increased its total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2024 to 26.7p per ordinary share (2023: 25.2p), a 6.0% increase on the previous year. Reserves It is the Board’s intention to utilise distributable reserves as well as portfolio income to fund dividend payments. Further details of the dividend payments for the year to 31 December 2024 and information on distributable reserves can be found in notes 7 and 2(b)(x) of the Financial Statements, respectively. Ongoing Charges and Discount Ongoing charges1 The Company’s ongoing charges ratio (‘OCR’) decreased to 0.56% (including the impact of the investment management fee waiver) (2023: 0.62%). Total administrative expenses were £3.9m (2023: £2.9m) and investment management expenses were £18.4m (2023: £16.3m). Further details of the Company’s expenses are provided in note 4 of the Financial Statements on page 90 of the Annual Report. The Company’s costs remain competitive for an actively managed multi-manager global equity strategy. Maintaining a stable discount1 One of the Company’s strategic objectives is to maintain a stable share price discount to NAV. The Company has the authority to buy back its own shares in the market if the discount is widening and to hold these shares in Treasury. During the year under review, the Company’s share price traded at an average discount of 4.7% (2023: 6.0%). As at 31 December 2024, the Company’s share price discount was 4.7% (2023: 5.4%). The average discount (unweighted) for the AIC Global Sector was 7.9%. Share issuance and buybacks As a result of the combination with Witan, 120,949,382 new ordinary shares were issued for assets valued at £1.5bn implying an effective issue price of £12.7459246 per share. The Company bought back 1.2%* (2023: 3.0%) of its issued share capital during the year, purchasing 4,722,000 shares which were placed in Treasury. The total cost of the share buybacks was £57.0m (2023: £86.6m). The weighted average discount of shares bought back in the year was 5.7%. Share buybacks contributed a total of 0.1% to the Company’s NAV performance in the year. 1.

What We Do How WTW manages the portfolio WTW as Investment Manager has overall responsibility for managing the Company’s portfolio. It is the Investment Manager’s job to select a diverse team of expert Stock Pickers, each of whom invest in a customised selection of 10-20 of their ‘best ideas’. WTW then allocates capital to them, relative to the risks the Stock Picker represents. For example, small-cap stocks are typically more risky than large-cap stocks, so on average a small-cap specialist would tend to receive less capital than a Stock Picker who focuses on large-cap stocks. However, the allocations do not remain static; WTW keeps them under constant review and varies them over time according to market conditions, with the goal of keeping our exposures to different parts of global stocks markets well balanced. Stock Pickers are encouraged to ignore the benchmark and only buy a small number of stocks in which they have strong conviction, while WTW manages risk through the Stock Picker allocations. On their own, each of the Stock Picker’s high-conviction mandates has the potential to perform well. This is supported by WTW’s experience of managing high-conviction portfolios and academic evidence1. But concentrated selections of stocks can be volatile and risky, so WTW mitigates these dangers by blending Stock Pickers with complementary investment approaches or styles, which can be expected to perform differently in different market conditions. This smooths out the peaks and troughs of performance associated with concentrated single-manager strategies. Several of the Stock Pickers in the current portfolio have been with the Investment Manager since inception of the multi-manager strategy, though it does actively monitor and rearrange the line-up where necessary. WTW invests a lot of time and effort on identifying skilled Stock Pickers for the Company’s portfolio, undertaking extensive qualitative and quantitative analysis. This due diligence process focuses on: 1. Sebastian & Attaluri, Conviction in Equity Investing, The Journal of Portfolio Management, Summer 2014. The Investment Manager’s views are formed over extended periods from multiple interactions with the Managers, including regular meetings. They look beyond past performance numbers to try to understand the ‘competitive edge’. This involves examining and interrogating processes for selecting stocks, adherence to this process through different market conditions, team dynamics, training and experience. Performance track records are just a single data point, and, without the context of the additional information, they are unlikely to persuade WTW that a Stock Picker is skilled. Once selected, the Investment Manager tends to form long-term partnerships with the Stock Pickers, generally only taking them out of the portfolio if something fundamental changes, such as the departure of a key individual from the business or a change in business strategy or fortunes. With highly active, concentrated portfolios, periods of short-term underperformance are to be expected and are not a reason to doubt a Stock Picker if they are adhering to their philosophy and process. WTW does, however, keep a constant eye out for talent and may bring new Managers into the portfolio at the expense of an incumbent if they are a better fit. Responsible investment WTW believes that Environmental, Social and Governance (‘ESG’) factors have the potential to impact financial risk and return. As long-term investors, WTW aims to incorporate these factors into its investment process. As stewards of the Company’s assets, WTW seeks to integrate responsible investment into its process for managing the portfolio. ESG factors can influence returns, so these risk factors are taken into account in WTW’s investment processes, including assessing how Managers evaluate ESG risk in their decisions over what stocks to purchase. Climate change poses potential significant risks to investment returns from many companies, which is why both WTW and the Company have stated an intention to manage the assets with a goal of achieving Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions from the portfolio by 2050, with an interim intention of reducing portfolio emissions by approximately 50% by 2030, relative to 2019. In 2024, we saw an increase in the portfolio’s weighted average carbon intensity (which measures carbon emissions as a proportion of revenue) from 71.9tCO2e/$M sales to 117. 9tCO2e/$M sales. Over the year, some higher-emitting stocks came into the portfolio including, industrial company Alaska Air and materials company Alcoa Ord, and our allocation to the higher-emitting Utilities sector went up slightly with purchases of companies such as Southern Ord and American Electric Power. We are monitoring our progress against our Net Zero goal, and our Managers and EOS at Federated Hermes (‘EOS’) continue to engage with the companies in the portfolio on climate related issues. Progress towards Net Zero will not be linear. Emissions from the portfolio are dependent on holdings, which can change from year to year as WTW’s Stock Pickers seek value for investors. If companies are perceived as being at higher financial risk by being slow to adapt to a Net Zero world, we expect to use stewardship, such as voting and engagement, to encourage positive changes to business practices. WTW believes this is preferable to excluding companies from the portfolio, since exclusion merely passes the responsibility of ownership to other investors who may be less scrupulous about adherence to ESG standards or regulation. As well as engaging with companies on climate change, WTW’s Stock Pickers, together with stewardship provider EOS, focused on a wide range of other issues last year. Overall, EOS engaged with 97 companies in the portfolio on 515 issues and objectives throughout the year. Key areas of engagement included board effectiveness, climate change, human and labour rights and human capital, biodiversity, digital rights and AI. Of these engagements, the environmental category accounted for 29% of the total number of engagements, with 63% of environmental engagements relating to climate change. Meanwhile the Stock Pickers cast votes at 3,346 resolutions in 2024. Of these resolutions, they voted against company management on 386 and abstained from voting on 38 occasions. How We Manage Our Risks In order to monitor and manage risks facing the Company, the Board maintains and regularly reviews a risk register and heat map. The risk register details all principal and emerging risks thought to face the Company at any given time. The principal risks facing the Company, as determined by the Board, are Investment, Operational and Legal and Regulatory Non-Compliance. As part of its review process, the Board considers input on the principal and emerging risks facing the Company from its key service providers WTW and Juniper. Any risks and their associated risk ratings are then discussed, and the risk register and heat map updated accordingly, with additional measures put in place to monitor, manage and mitigate risks as required. During the period the Board carefully reviewed the risks associated with the implementation of the combination and the post transaction integration risks. Principal risks The principal risks facing the Company, how they have changed during the year and how the Board aims to monitor and manage these risks are detailed below. Emerging risks Emerging risks are typified by having a high degree of uncertainty and may result from sudden events, new potential trends or changing specific risks where the impact and probable effect is hard to assess. As the assessment becomes clearer, the risk may be added to the risk matrix of ‘known’ risks. The Board is currently monitoring a number of emerging risks: geopolitical tension continues to be an emerging risk for the Company due to ongoing conflicts across the world. Along with increased populism and nationalism, these risks may impact individual economies and global markets. Although covered in the operational risk section above, the Board recognises the increased risk that cybercrime and the misuse of AI poses to the Company. Geopolitical events such as the conflicts in the Middle East region, coupled with the potential breakdown of post war alliances and potential new trade tariffs and changes to US economic and international policies introduced by President Trump, could bring uncertainty and fragility to capital markets in 2025, including persistent or reacceleration of inflationary pressures. Stakeholder Engagement – Section 172 Statement The Directors have a number of obligations including those under section 172 of the Companies Act 2006. These obligations relate to how the Board takes account of various factors in making its decisions – including the impact of its decisions on key stakeholders. The Board is focused on the Company’s performance and its responsibilities to stakeholders, corporate culture and diversity, as well as its contributions to wider society, and it takes account of stakeholder interests when making decisions on behalf of the Company. As an externally-managed investment trust, the Board considers the Company’s key stakeholders to be existing and potential new shareholders and its service providers. Full details on the primary ways in which the Board engaged with the Company’s key stakeholders can be found on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Dean BuckleyChair6 March 2025 Viability and Going Concern Statements Viability Statement The Board has assessed the prospects and viability of the Company beyond the 12 months required by the Going Concern accounting provisions. The Board considered the current position of the Company and its prospects, strategy and planning process as well as its principal and emerging risks in the current, medium and long term, as set out on pages 27 to 29 of the Annual Report. After the year-end but prior to approval of these Accounts, the Board reviewed its performance against its strategic objectives and its management of the principal and emerging risks facing the Company. The Board received regular updates on performance and other factors that could impact on the viability of the Company. The Board has concluded that there is a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due for at least the next five years; the Board expects this position to continue over many more years to come. The Company’s Investment Objective, which was approved by shareholders in April 2019, is to deliver a real return over the long term, through a combination of capital growth and a rising dividend, and the Board regards the Company’s shares as a long-term investment. The Board believes that a period of five years is considered a reasonable period for investment in equities and is appropriate for the composition of the Company’s portfolio. In arriving at this conclusion, the Board considered: Going Concern Statement In view of the conclusions drawn in the foregoing Viability Statements, which considered the resources of the Company over the next 12 months and beyond, the Directors believe that the Company has adequate financial resources to continue in existence for at least the period to 31 March 2026. Therefore, the Directors believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the Going Concern basis in preparing the financial statements. Directors’ Responsibilities The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors to prepare Financial Statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards. Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss for that period. In preparing these Financial Statements, the Directors are required to: The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions, and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s position, performance, business model and strategy. Website publication The Directors are responsible for ensuring the Annual Report and the Financial Statements are made available on a website. Financial Statements are published on the Company’s website in accordance with legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements, which may vary from legislation in other jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the Financial Statements contained therein. Report of Directors and Responsibility Statement The Report of the Directors on pages 36 to 69 of the Annual Report (other than pages 61 to 63 which form part of the Strategic Report) of the Annual Report and Accounts has been approved by the Board. The Directors have chosen to include information relating to future development of the Company and relationships with suppliers, customers and others, and their impact on the Board’s decisions on pages 30 to 35 of the Annual Report. Each of the Directors, who are listed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report, confirm to the best of their knowledge that: On behalf of the Board All revenue and capital items in the above statement derive from continuing operations. The ‘Total’ column of this statement is the profit and loss account of the Company and the ‘Revenue’ and ‘Capital’ columns represent supplementary information prepared under guidance issued by the Association of Investment Companies. The Company does not have any other comprehensive income and hence profit for the year, as disclosed above, is the same as the Company’s total comprehensive income. The £553.6m (2023: £574.6m) of unrealised capital reserve arising on the revaluation of investments is subject to fair value movements and may not be readily realisable at short notice, as such it may not be entirely distributable. The unrealised capital reserve includes unrealised gains on borrowings of £22.8m (2023: £5.5m) and gains on unquoted investments of £3.5m (2023: £nil) which are not distributable. The Financial Statements were approved by the Board of Directors and authorised for issue on 6 March 2025. They were signed on its behalf by: Jo DixonChair of the Audit and Risk Committee The financial information set out above does not constitute the Company's statutory Financial Statements for the years ended 31 December 2024 or 2023, but is derived from those Financial Statements. Statutory accounts for 2023 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies and those for 2024 will be delivered following the Company's Annual General Meeting. The auditors have reported on those accounts; their reports were unqualified, did not draw attention to any matters by way of emphasis without qualifying their report and did not contain statements under s498(2) or (3) Companies Act 2006. The same accounting policies, presentations and methods of computation are followed in these Financial Statements as were applied in the Company’s last annual audited Financial Statements, other than those stated in the Annual Report. Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards (‘IASs’). The Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except that investments and fixed rate notes are stated at fair value through the profit and loss. The Association of Investment Companies (‘AIC’) issued a Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Companies (‘AIC SORP’) in July 2022. The Directors have sought to prepare the Financial Statements in accordance with the AIC SORP where the recommendations are consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). The Company qualifies as an investment entity. The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share. Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same. There are amounts of £1,222 (2023: £1,222) and £34,225 (2023: £34,225) owed to AT2006 and The Second Alliance Trust Limited, respectively, at year-end. There are no other related parties other than those noted below. Transactions with key management personnel Details of the Non-Executive Directors are disclosed on pages 37 to 40 of the Annual Report. For the purpose of IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, key management personnel comprised the Non-Executive Directors of the Company. Details of remuneration are disclosed in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 to 60 of the Annual Report.
