Title: The big bills to watch as Colorado’s 2026 legislative session begins

Colorado lawmakers will try to tackle some of the state’s most pressing issues during the 2026 legislative session, which starts Wednesday, from affordable housing and the high cost of health care to public safety and artificial intelligence. Any bills debated at the Capitol this year will come against the backdrop of a strained state budget. The legislature is facing a roughly $850 million shortfall, meaning there’s essentially no money to spend on new programs and services.Here are some of the big-ticket legislative items to keep tabs on during the 120-day lawmaking term. Democrats remain in control at the Capitol. They have big majorities in both the state House and Senate, and Democratic Gov. Jared Polis gets to decide which bills to veto. That means Democrats get to set the legislature’s priorities, and this year, Democratic leadership said their goal is to make Colorado more affordable. “We just really want to build upon what we’ve done already when it comes to increasing wages, when it comes to lowering costs — just creating pathways for families to be able to succeed and not have to worry so much about how they’re going to pay their medical bills or groceries,” said House Majority Leader Monica Duran, a Wheat Ridge Democrat. Duran said Democrats plan to take a multipronged approach to bringing down the cost of living, with bills to addressing health care premiums, homeowners insurance and property taxes. They also want to expand last year’s efforts to increase price transparency. Democrats plan to introduce several bills aimed at boosting Colorado’s affordable housing stock, setting up a familiar fight with local governments over land use.One of the most significant housing measures, called the HOME Act, would give qualifying affordable housing developers, public schools and universities the ability to bypass local zoning laws and build homes on their land. “We feel like, with those three entities in the bill, that we’re really going to capture a lot of folks who are already doing really good work in this space to bring about more supply and, further than that, affordable housing to our communities,” said state Rep. Andrew Boesenecker, a Fort Collins Democrat who is leading the legislation. The proposal — modeled in part on a bill that failed last year — has the support of Polis, who has made increasing housing inventory a top priority as he enters his last year in office. Another affordable housing bill Democrats plan to introduce this year would make it easier for homeowners to sell off a portion of their property. The proposal builds on legislation passed in 2024 that made it easier for Coloradans to build accessory dwelling units, also known as casitas, on their properties, and would apply to higher-density areas of the state, like the Denver metro area and in Grand Junction. Local governments are already opposing both bills. The Colorado Municipal League, which represents the interests of towns and cities at the state Capitol, argues the measures would undermine the rights of local communities to make decisions for themselves and could violate the constitutional self-governance powers of home rule cities. Democrats also want to make property insurance more affordable by creating programs to help people protect their homes against hail and wildfire, the two largest insurance cost drivers. The legislature tried to make that happen last year by imposing fees on policies to fund the mitigation initiatives, but the proposal was rejected over concerns about imposing new costs on consumers. House Speaker Julie McCluskie, a Dillon Democrat who is leading the effort, said she’s looking for a new funding mechanism. “I am pursuing something that will hopefully drive funding for those homeowners that are willing to harden their roofs,” she said. “We also want to pursue ways we can protect communities from catastrophic wildfire with either some type of reinsurance plan or deeper investments in mitigation.” Keeping health insurance premiums down is another central piece of Democrats’ affordability work this year and comes in response to congressional Republicans’ decision not to extend subsidies for Affordable Care Act plans. The legislature passed a one-year fix last summer, during the special legislative session. Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to sustain those savings going forward. It’s proving difficult given the state’s budget constraints. “I don’t know what the specifics of the bill are going to look like at this point,” said state Rep. Kyle Brown, a Louisville Democrat. “We’ve been talking about different funding sources.” Brown said he’s optimistic that a wide range of perspectives have come to the table to develop a solution, from hospitals to insurance companies to consumer groups. House Democrats also plan to expand their work to increase transparency around consumer prices in an effort to prevent price gouging. Last year, they passed measures to crack down on price increases during natural disasters and outlaw undisclosed fees for goods and services, also called junk fees, especially when it comes to rental housing.

Bill sponsor Rep. Yara Zokaie, D-Fort Collins, said the goal is to make it easier for consumers to find affordable options when shopping for groceries. “People are not able to really make an informed choice when they don’t know that they’re paying a markup,” Zokaie said. The bill also would put a cap on how much a business can charge “captive consumers” for an item. Captive consumers are those who have to buy an item from one specific seller. For example, when someone buys beer at a baseball game, the price is higher than it would be outside the stadium. Democrats’ bill would limit how much can be charged for a beer in a stadium relative to what it would cost in a more traditional setting, like a restaurant. Senate Majority Leader Robert Rodriguez, D-Denver, said lawmakers are also looking at ways to replace certain tax credits rolled back by the Trump administration. Given the political makeup of the legislature, Democrats do not need the support of Republicans to pass bills, and no GOP measures can pass without Democratic support. Still, the vast majority of legislation that becomes law in Colorado has bipartisan support. And affordability is an area where the two parties will work together. Senate Minority Leader Cleave Simpson, R-Alamosa, said his caucus will look for areas where it can find common ground with Democrats.“Making life more affordable,” Simpson said, summarizing the GOP’s big goal at the Capitol this year. The legislature is expected to take its third stab at revising a 2024 law that aims to prevent discrimination by artificial intelligence systems used by businesses and governments to make decisions in areas like hiring, education, health care and banking. Lawmakers delayed implementation of the law to June from February after they failed to broker a deal among consumer protection groups, unions and the business community — namely Big Tech — during the special session over the summer. They also tried and failed to reach an agreement on the policy during last year’s regular lawmaking term. As it is written now, the law will require companies to assess and disclose, to regulators and consumers, when AI is being used for consequential decisions, like employment, loans and housing. It will also require companies to explain how their technology works to consumers who dispute how AI made a determination. Those in the tech industry who develop AI tools have complained that the law will stifle innovation. Separately, companies that use AI products say the statute is too burdensome and will expose them to a great deal of liability. Rodriguez, the lawmaker most involved in the bill, suggested he won’t let changes to the AI law pass this year if they don’t offer enough protections to consumers. He thinks Colorado’s bill will become an example for other state legislatures, so he’s trying to be extra vigilant. “I don’t want to be the model bill that is not protective of consumers,” he said last week at The Colorado Sun’s legislative preview event. “That is a line that I’ve been really strong (on). Because once one bill is in, everybody starts running that. Are we actually doing the right thing to protect Coloradans and consumers across the country?” Rodriguez called AI the “industrial revolution in the technological age.” He said any tweaks to the law must include requirements that consumers be made aware when AI is used to make decisions about their health care, banking and hiring, and that consumers be given a chance to correct information and appeal. “Those are my core beliefs,” he said. “Everything inside of that I’m willing to negotiate.” Rodriguez said the governor’s latest task force of interest groups looking at the regulation was “in a good place” as of a few weeks ago. And Rodriguez is optimistic the law will take effect in June with changes. Polis said his concern is that Colorado will “go it alone” on AI regulation, which would discourage tech companies from operating in the state. “We’re not a big state,” he said. “So if we go more to what California has done or Texas has done, that would be one model. Ultimately, I do believe this will fall in Congress’ lap — and I hope that they take it on. The American people want to see protections, and we also want to make sure we’re a great country for innovation. But I think it’s very perilous for Colorado to do something that is different than either other states or the federal government, because, ultimately, consumers will be hurt in Colorado.” Adding another layer to the debate is the executive order signed by President Trump on Dec. 11 aimed at banning states from regulating AI by threatening lawsuits and funding cuts to states that don’t comply. AI will likely be one of the most-lobbied issues at the Capitol this year. A review of lobbying disclosures from the Secretary of State’s Office found that nearly half of the 182 companies and organizations that hired lobbyists to sway lawmakers on AI during the special session were from the health care and tech sectors, followed closely by investment, general business and telecommunications groups. Several other technology bills are also in the works. One measure will aim to require that social media sites and video games have privacy settings that can be set by parents and not easily turned off by kids. Zokaie, who is leading the bill, hopes the proposal will help prevent the platforms from promoting addictive or compulsory use or from becoming places where adult users can exploit children. “We’re not going to stop that from happening completely, no,” she said, “but the company is going to have a responsibility to show they took reasonable steps to prevent it from happening.” Social media companies generally oppose additional regulation and are expected to fight the bill. Two measures around data centers are also set to be introduced at the Capitol this year. One of the upcoming bills will be focused on the potential environmental impacts of data centers. It would require developers and the companies running the centers to be transparent about water and power usage. Bill sponsor Sen. Cathy Kipp, D-Fort Collins, said she wants the bill to also require that data centers use as much renewable energy as possible and prevent their energy usage from impacting the cost of utilities for the communities around them. A second data center bill that may be introduced would offer some incentives to businesses that build the massive facilities in Colorado. “It’s one of those things where business wants it and labor wants it, but then the environmentalists have concerns with it,” Rodriguez said. For the second year in a row, the Colorado labor movement will try to tweak the state’s labor laws to make it easier for unions to force all workers at a company to pay fees for collective bargaining representation — regardless of whether they are members of a union. A forthcoming bill, once again dubbed the Worker Protection Act by supporters, would repeal a requirement that a union get the approval of at least 75% of workers at a company before they can negotiate with a business over union security. Union security is the term for when workers are forced to pay fees for collective bargaining representation, even if they have not joined the union. Unions are required to bargain on behalf of all workers at a company which is why they feel it’s only fair that union security be imposed to cover the cost of things like lawyers and negotiating experts. Polis vetoed the same measure in 2025, and he said he’ll veto the 2026 version, too, if there aren’t major changes. He’s not willing to eliminate the union security vote altogether. “There’s nothing different, so I’m not quite sure why they’re doing it again,” Polis said. The governor said he is open to reducing the 75% threshold — a proposal labor leaders rejected — and he would be willing to negotiate a similar compromise with business groups if asked. Preventing the Worker Protection Act from passing is the top priority of business interests at the Capitol this year — just as it was in 2025 Democrats also plan to make energy and the environment priorities at the Capitol this year, though the details of their plans remain in flux. “You’re going to hear a lot about energy this session,” Polis said, “including making it easier to permit energy projects and get them done. One of the reasons we can’t have nice things is we don’t let them be built.” Some of those changes may be tied to a rewrite of the laws governing Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission, which oversees how much some consumers pay for things like electricity and natural gas. Another energy bill planned for this session is tied to Democrats’ affordability push. The proposal would require Colorado’s biggest energy providers, including Xcel Energy and Black Hills Energy, to provide electricity to low-income customers at a minimal cost. Under the bill, utility companies would have to provide these customers with enough electricity for basic needs and only charge them the cost of producing the energy without making a profit. Sponsors also want the bill to prevent the utility companies from increasing rates for other customers to make up for any losses in profit from the lower rates for low-income customers. House Minority Leader Jarvis Caldwell, a Colorado Springs Republican, said his caucus is concerned about the pace of the state’s climate and energy goals and how they could result in increased costs for consumers. “We’re really concerned about this 2050 goal for a 100% carbon emissions reduction being moved up to 2040, which when you talk to utility companies, they all say that, frankly, it’s undoable,” Caldwell said, referencing a rumor about Democrats’ environmental policy plans this year. “The result of it will be potentially doubling our utility bills within the next couple of years.” Another focus for Democrats will be responding to the Trump administration, particularly when it comes to federal immigration enforcement. State laws already prevent state and local officials in Colorado from sharing Coloradans’ personal information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement unless it’s being used for a criminal investigation. But some lawmakers would like to tighten those limits. Last month, state Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, said she wants to strengthen existing state laws to ensure the liability extends “beyond just the individuals that might share public information, but it also extends to agencies that allow it to happen.” “We still have more work to do to protect our communities and protect individuals that are targeted by this lawless agency,” Garcia said, referring to ICE, on a call in December with reporters and state legislators from California, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia. The existing laws are at the center of a lawsuit filed against Polis last year by a former state employee, Scott Moss. Moss says he was instructed by the governor’s office to turn over Coloradans’ personal information to ICE in response to an immigration enforcement subpoena from the agency. A state judge has blocked Polis from ordering certain state workers to hand over the requested personal information to ICE while the case is litigated. Lawmakers could also adopt ICE-related policies enacted in other states, like requiring agents to wear masks and clear identification. Democrats also plan to introduce bills to improve public safety and regulate law enforcement. One bill would require law enforcement to get a warrant before using the Flock Safety database in their investigations. Flock is a video surveillance network that includes license plate readers. Police say it helps them with investigations, but data privacy experts are concerned about misuse — including by federal immigration enforcement. The system has been used incorrectly in at least one high-profile case in Colorado. Another measure would require utilities to notify the public about planned power outages via phone calls or text messages, email and broadcasts on local radio and news stations. Supporters argue that early warnings are necessary for Coloradans to safely prepare for power outages, especially those who rely on electronic medical devices, and that alerts can give them time to make necessary preparations, like turning on a generator. The bill is in part a response to the death of a Delta woman who received no advance warning of a planned power shutoff and died when her medical equipment failed during the outage.A third bill, sponsored by Majority Leader Duran, would establish a statewide assessment protocol to help law enforcement identify domestic violence danger faster. One public safety issue that doesn’t appear to be on Democrats’ radar this year, after a series of major bills over the past decade, is guns.

Title: The 3 main storylines investors need to be watching as earnings season picks up steam

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Earnings season kicked off with a bang on Tuesday with a report from headliner JPMorgan. The company's stock ultimately fell 4% due to a mix of two factors unique to the business: (1) a surprise drop in investment banking revenue and (2) uncertainty around President Trump's proposed credit card interest cap, to which JPMorgan is especially exposed as America's largest issuer. It was a good primer for the upcoming earnings season, which could make or break the fortunes of major US companies, especially when it comes to AI plans. The previous quarter already saw a simmering of the red-hot AI trade for companies planning to continue spending heavily on capex without immediate tangible results. Just ask Meta and Microsoft how it went when they pledged to keep pouring billions into AI (spoiler alert: not well). With that in mind, First Trade — with the help of the equity strategy team at Goldman Sachs — has put together a three-part earnings primer for those looking to gain an edge up. 1. Watch for signs of AI-adoption progress So far, in the AI trade, it's been the infrastructure stocks that have dominated — the chipmakers and picks-and-shovels companies that make up the physical components of data centers. Goldman says that gains will broaden out to increasingly include companies showing productivity gains unlocked by AI. A prime example of this dynamic in action came last quarter, from freight-logistics company CH Robinson, which raised its profit-growth forecast specifically due to new AI efficiencies. The stock spiked 20% during the next trading day, and it's been at record highs pretty much ever since. The market is being clear about what it wants. Actually achieving that is the hard part. 2. Monitor how companies are planning to spend their cash Concerns over AI overspending reached a fever pitch last quarter — a trend Goldman expects to subside throughout 2026 after one last hurrah. The firm predicts that hyperscaler capex will see above-forecast growth for one more quarter, then begin a gradual deceleration, as shown in this chart: An additional element to watch is the degree to which that AI capex spending comes at the expense of share repurchases. After all, buybacks are crucial for engineering share-price increases during periods devoid of other positive catalysts. Goldman predicts that investors will reward companies generating strong free cash flow, which have the flexibility to return cash to shareholders. The firm says that group of stocks already outperformed throughout 2025. 3. Check the sustainability of earnings growth for mega-cap tech The number to watch here is 20%. That's the target Goldman has set for Magnificent 7 profit expansion in the quarter. Any downside disappointment here could mean stock declines. After all, earnings growth is the lifeblood of any bull market. Jump to

Title: Goldman Sachs breaks down what the doomsayers get wrong about the US economy in 8 charts

Every time Alex publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. American investors are worried. They've been worried for a while now: that a recession is coming, that stock valuations are overheated, and that AI spending is the only thing keeping the economy (and markets) afloat. And if you're in the wealth management business, like Goldman Sachs, it's your job to listen to these concerns. To nod solemnly and empathize as your millionaire clients lay bare their greatest fears. And then it's your job to tell them that, actually, things aren't so bad, and despite all the apparent chaos out there, it would be quite unwise to cash out your chips in the US stock market. Goldman Sachs' wealth management unit did just that Monday, sending out a report to clients saying that the outlook for the US economy and stock market is bright — and that most of the concerns keeping investors awake at night are overblown. "Clients — and also some colleagues — are now asking whether it is time to reduce exposure to US equities in favor of other developed and emerging markets," the firm's Investment Strategy Group wrote in its 2026 outlook report. But it concludes that many of the perceived risks dominating conversations these days — from tariffs to government dysfunction to market concentration — are overstated, and that the most significant risk for equities, a US recession, is unlikely. The group puts the probability of a recession at 25%, down from last year's estimate of around 35%. Instead, Goldman's base-case projection calls for continued economic expansion and robust earnings growth for the S&P 500. "We wanted to emphasize that in spite of all the headlines that you read about 'Is America on the decline?' et cetera, we want to make a very strong stand and say, 'No, that is not the case,'" Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer of the Investment Strategy Group, said in a media appearance for the report's release. The US remains the preeminent destination for investors around the world, Mossavar-Rahmani said — and a "surprising" number of popular narratives miss what's actually driving growth and returns. "We want to dispel a couple of myths," Mossavar-Rahmani said. Here are some of the other takeaways from Goldman's Investment Strategy Group, and what they're telling wealthy clients to do with their money in 2026. Goldman's team argues that "US preeminence" is evident across multiple measures, including economic wealth, labor productivity, deep capital markets, and natural resources — advantages they say are difficult for other major economies to match. They also point to US leadership in key innovation areas, including semiconductors, biotechnology, and AI, as well as the scale and liquidity of US equity and bond markets. Despite political turmoil and tariff uncertainty, Goldman says the US remains a magnet for global capital. "When people say, 'Oh, money's flowing out of the US.' It actually isn't. We had one month when that was the case," Mossavar-Rahmani said. That month of outflows came last April, in the aftermath of Trump's Liberation Day tariff plan announcement. Since then, foreign investors have flooded back into the US. One argument for US economic fragility is that the boom in AI-adjacent tech spending — including data centers, chips, and power infrastructure — is propping up GDP. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, which has a more dour global economic outlook, estimated the US would have been in a recession in the first half of last year if not for AI investments. A report from Deutsche Bank shows they're not alone in that sentiment. But Goldman says that view is off base, and that people underestimate how much consumption contributes to GDP. The bank's investment strategy group estimates all tech-related spending accounted for 0.5% of the 2.1% GDP growth in 2025, and Goldman's chief economist says AI capital expenditures accounted for just 0.1%. The estimate, which "includes everything related to AI, including data centers," Mossavar-Rahmani said, is "probably a little bit on the high side because they're trying to include all the power generation as well, all the utility infrastructure that has benefits elsewhere other than just AI." This dovetails with the myth that the US stock market is dependent on AI and the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), according to Mossavar-Rahmani. "It's just not correct that AI has driven everything in the US, including all earnings and including S&P 500 returns," Mossavar-Rahmani said. While no one disputes the incredible performance of these tech titans, Goldman contends that the rest of the S&P 500 receives short shrift and that earnings growth and returns remain respectable even after stripping out the contributions from the Magnificent Seven. "This idea that it would be a poor economy, a weak economy, no earnings, no returns is again, just another falsehood," Mossavar-Rahmani said. The S&P 500 hit record highs last year, and investors often worry that new highs mean a painful drop is imminent. In reality, history shows that the market usually continues to post robust gains after hitting an all-time high, Goldman notes. While Goldman acknowledges valuations are elevated, it doesn't see an overheated market reminiscent of past market bubbles. It expects the S&P 500 to continue its rise in 2026, with a base-case estimate of a 7% total return and 10% earnings growth. Goldman's "good" scenario assumes a 17% return; its "bad" scenario assumes a 15% decline in a recession. (The team assigns a higher probability to upside than downside.) "We do think that there are some good fundamental reasons why valuations have increased over time that are not just because of speculative excesses," said Brett Nelson, head of tactical asset allocation within Goldman's investment strategy group. In the run-up to the Dot Com bust at the turn of the century, for example, valuations and investor exuberance were divorced from earnings reality, which isn't the case today. Yes, the S&P 500 is highly concentrated, Goldman says, but today's tech companies have enormous profit margins justifying their stock valuations, not just hype. Goldman isn't worried about a bubble in US equities. Where its investment strategists do see cause for concern is bitcoin. "We do think bitcoin is a bubble," Mossavar-Rahmani said, noting that explosive price behavior in the cryptocurrency usually precedes a steep drawdown. "We are even more convinced than we were in 2021 that bitcoin has no real value, that it is a speculative and trading asset and that only questionable practices support its current price," the 2026 outlook report says. Another area of concern is gold, which is at unsustainable price levels unless central banks — especially the Chinese government and households — continue to buy it to prop it up, Mossavar-Rahmani said. "We do not recommend clients use gold or bitcoin as a hedge in their portfolios," the report says. There are also "pockets of euphoria" in generative AI, with some public and private companies carrying bubble-like valuations, according to Goldman's outlook, which calls out the circular financing, easy credit, and questionable economics, coupled with soaring expectations. "Some AI company founders and CEOs of the major companies involved with AI have raised expectations to an unrealistic level about what AI will deliver in the near future in terms of both revenues for the AI companies and productivity gains for enterprises leveraging AI," the report says.

Title: AI Could Spell Trouble for Software. These Experts Say to Avoid One Stock In Particular

Software was once the hottest industry on Wall Street. Not so in the AI era. S&P 500 software stocks lagged the broader index for the second consecutive year in 2025 as companies making the “picks and shovels” of the AI buildout—like semiconductors and memory devices—led the stock market higher. And analysts expect the challenges weighing on software stocks, especially application developers, to persist in 2026. One example: Oppenheimer on Tuesday downgraded Adobe (ADBE) stock to “Perform” from “Outperform” and withdrew its price target entirely, citing threats from AI that apply to varying degrees across the application software industry. The news pulled Adobe, shares of which have lost more than a fifth of their value over the past 12 months, down more than 5% on Tuesday. Software stocks were expected to have a strong 2025 supported by the deployment of AI agents. The rollout of those agents has moved much slower than expected, weighing on investor sentiment and raising concerns about the software industry's vulnerability to AI disruption. One of the primary issues Adobe faces, according to Oppenheimer, is the perception that AI is weakening its competitive position. Gen AI “is increasing the velocity of content creation while lowering price and subscriber growth,” wrote analysts led by Brian Schwartz. The company faces new competition from LLM providers like OpenAI and advertising platforms like Meta, which have introduced creative tools that allow people other options for doing what previously required an Adobe license and specialized knowledge. Investors also worry that generative AI could upend the seat-based pricing model on which many software-as-a-service providers like Adobe are built. Traditionally, Adobe sells a client a set number of Creative Cloud licenses for a set amount of time, which has meant reliable revenue. It and other software companies will have to adapt if the usage-based pricing—in which a customer pays each time they use a service—favored by AI developers and hyperscalers becomes the norm. Even if seat-based models remain standard, AI threatens to undercut software subscription growth by helping companies to get by with smaller teams and lowering the cost of switching vendors, according to a recent Deutsche Bank note. AI isn’t seen as a threat to all software companies. Infrastructure software stocks performed well last year as companies accelerated IT modernization and cloud migration efforts as they sought to transition to more AI usage, according to Deutsche Bank. Shares of data analytics software provider Palantir (PLTR) more than doubled in value last year as its commercial sales soared. Cloud migrations also helped support shares of companies like MongoDB (MDB) and Snowflake (SNOW). Morgan Stanley analysts expect many of the trends that fueled last year's infrastructure software rally to carry into 2026. They argue the rollout of AI copilots and agents should support demand for data management and observability tools, as should robust cloud growth. Cloud and AI spending are expected to remain top priorities for companies this year. Cloud spending growth is expected to hold steady at 10%, according to a Jefferies survey of IT executives and chief investment officers. That survey also found that, on average, nearly 12% of IT budgets will be dedicated to AI this year, up from 6.5% last year. Adobe's stock is down more than 50% since peaking in 2021. About half of the analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rate Adobe stock a “Buy,” while two are neutral and three recommend selling. The average price target near $392 represents 26% upside from Tuesday’s close.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry explains why he's betting against Nvidia, not Meta or Microsoft

Every time Theron publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Michael Burry says he's betting against Nvidia instead of Meta, Alphabet, or Microsoft because the chipmaker is particularly vulnerable to the AI boom ending in disaster. Nvidia is "simply the purest play," Burry wrote in a Substack post last weekend. The company has become "entirely dependent on hyperscaler spending, and I do not see how that math works," he continued. The investor of "The Big Short" fame, who pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing online late last year, added that Nvidia is likely to "sell $400 billion of its chips this year and there are less than $100 billion in application layer use cases." "Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted," Burry wrote. "So shorting it is cheap." Burry also name-checked CoreWeave, a provider of cloud services built for AI and a strategic partner of Nvidia, calling it the graphics-processor giant's "pet." Nvidia's stock price has surged 12-fold since the start of 2023, making the graphics-chip maker the world's most valuable public company with a $4.5 trillion market capitalization. Nvidia did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. Burry said that betting against Meta would mean he was "also shorting its social media/advertising dominance," and placing a wager against Alphabet would mean he was "shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc." He added that being short Microsoft would be tantamount to "shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath," referring to the company's software-as-a-service tools, including Word and Excel. Those Big Tech titans aren't "pure shorts on AI" and have staying power, Burry wrote. "They will realize they should not be spending so much, write off assets, and possibly restate earnings," he said. "But they still are dominant companies globally away from the AI buildout." On the other hand, Burry said he would short OpenAI if it were a public company. He highlighted the ChatGPT maker's $500 billion valuation in October, which exceeds the market values of Johnson & Johnson, Bank of America, and Costco. Burry said he owns bearish put options on Oracle, and directly shorted the database company in the last six months. "I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making," he wrote, adding that the company, cofounded by tech billionaire Larry Ellison, is making unnecessary, inexplicable moves and "ego" might be the driver. Burry is famous for predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s housing bubble, an episode of his career that was chronicled in the book and movie "The Big Short." He wrote on Substack that "technological obsolescence is on the menu as Nvidia now seems to introduce a new chip solution every year or less." That echoed a previous post in which he said Nvidia's Big Tech customers were overstating the lifespan of its chips to drag out their depreciation and flatter their short-term profits, raising the prospect of future writedowns. Burry also warned of trouble ahead, saying he's betting against AI stocks to "have the exposure on the right side when the music stops." Burry spoke about AI more broadly in his post, drawing a parallel between its rise and the history of electricity. He pointed out that building power plants and grids in the late 1980s and early 1990s required "massive upfront capital outlays," technological advances meant equipment such as transformers became quickly outdated and assets rapidly depreciated, and "cutthroat price warfare" between suppliers meant many ran into financial difficulties and were forced to merge with rivals. "What I see in electrification is very similar to what happened during the 2000 data transmission bubble and what I see happening with the AI bubble," he wrote. Burry said that electricity was as transformative to the modern world as a medicine that enables a patient to walk 10 feet, whereas AI "might be the anabolic steroid that allows superhuman feats of strength and ability," but could ultimately prove "more dangerous than anything." He also repeated his caution that if the US tries to win the AI race by going all-in on increasingly power-hungry chips, it will lose as China is ramping up its power-generation capacity much more quickly. "I see a big inventory problem in the AI buildout as a result of the current power generation setup," Burry said. Jump to

Title: Google's corporate parent joins $4 trillion club as investors continue to bet on AI breakthroughs

Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that’s become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race Google parent Alphabet Inc. on Monday became the fourth Big Tech powerhouse to be valued at $4 trillion, a once seemingly unfathomable milestone that's become more like a rite of passage amid an artificial intelligence arms race. Alphabet reached the threshold just four months after Google dodged the U.S. government's attempt to break up its internet empire following a ruling last year that branded its ubiquitous search engine an illegal monopoly. In an effort to prevent further abuses, a federal judge overseeing the case ordered a shake-up that investors widely interpreted as a slap on the wrist, resulting in a 57% increase in Alphabet's stock price since then that has created an additional $1.4 trillion in shareholder wealth. The rapid run-up thrust Alphabet into a $4 trillion club that has previously welcomed computer chipmaker Nvidia, which became the first to cross the barrier in July. Both Apple and Microsoft also surpassed market values of $4 trillion last year, but they have fallen back mid worries that the spending spree on AI will turn into a bubble that bursts. Nvidia's market value briefly topped $5 trillion in late October, before backtracking as the AI bubble fears also exacted a toll on its stock price because its chipsets are needed to power the technology. Meanwhile, Amazon is currently valued at $2.6 trillion, in part because of its AI ambitions, and Facebook parent Meta Platforms is valued at $1.6 trillion for some of the same reasons. Electric automaker Tesla also is betting heavily on AI, a gambit that prompted the company — now valued at $1.5 trillion — to approve a compensation package t hat would pay CEO Elon Musk $1 trillion if several targets are hit, including reaching a market value of more than $8.5 trillion. Alphabet joined the $4 trillion club on the same day that Apple announced it will rely on Google’s AI technology to help smarten up its virtual assistant Siri after coming up short in its own efforts to bring more advanced features to the iPhone. Google is well positioned to become one of the big winners in the AI battle because it is deploying the technology to transform its search engine into more of a conversational answer engine to compete against the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT and Perplexity. The next generation of the Gemini model underlying Google's AI technology has been winning rave reviews since its recent release, helping to drive up Alphabet's stock price while the shares of other AI-driven companies have dipped with ongoing bubble worries. Google's Cloud division that sells AI tools to corporate customers and government agencies has emerged as Alphabet's fastest growing segment during the past three years while AI technology has enabled its Waymo robotaxi division to dispatch more self-driving vehicles in cities across the U.S. The competitive threats posed by rising AI stars such as OpenAI and Perplexity is one of the reasons that U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta rebuffed the U.S. Justice Department's proposal to force Google to sell its industry-leading Chrome web browser. The judge reasoned the technological advances unleashed by AI already have been forcing significant changes in online search. Alphabet's market value could plunge if investor sentiment about the company's exposure to a potential AI bubble suddenly shift. Even Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai conceded that some market “irrationality” is contributing to the skyrocketing market values of Big Tech companies during a November interview with the BBC. “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said if the AI-driven euphoria suddenly evaporates. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

January 12, 2026 This isn't my usual deep-dive article where I unpack a specific subject such as an app I built, my obsession with craft, or revisiting an old iPod. I set out to share a few reflections and musings on a year marked by personal and professional change. This was a year of stripping back to the essentials: where I live, how I work, and what I build. I've been running this site for just over 20 years now. I began writing it in my dorm room at Georgia Tech, hosted on a G4 Mac Mini1, as a way for me to share technical how-to guides and news. I used WordPress for the first handful of years, then the Ruby static site generator Jekyll for a decade. It wasn't until 2024 that I redesigned and rebuilt this site from scratch using Next.js.2 I'll be turning 40 years old in 2026, which is still surreal to me. For my entire career, I was always the younger one on the team, and what feels like a sudden shift means that's no longer true. In many ways, that change is actually a clarifying feeling. I'm more focused and fired up to do great work than I've ever been. I'm driven by the desire to craft great products: things I can be proud of working on. My framing shifted from "Can I help this team build this product?" to "Is this the problem I want to spend my best years on?" I've developed a visceral aversion to working in any environment where I don't feel like I can do the best work of my career. The view from the Sesame office in San Francisco where I now work My taste and judgment have compounded over these years. I've been through similar experiences that I can draw from across whatever I'm working on. Even on minor UI challenges alone, I'm still surprised at how often I pull inspiration from my time at Twitter where density was king and compact timelines ruled everything. I always try to keep that as just one input though, especially working in AI when so much is continually changing and you can't bring assumptions with you.3 Table of contents The year started with me finally selling the one-bedroom condo I had purchased a decade earlier. I completely regret purchasing that place. Not because it had major maintenance issues or anything like that, but because it was a horrible investment. I had it for 10 years and still lost money on it once you factor in the lower sale price, prep work to sell (staging, floor upgrades, painting), and associated fees. It was a relatively new building in a bustling shopping and restaurant area in Nob Hill near Russian Hill. The entire building was only nine years old when I bought my unit, so I only had minor maintenance tasks over the years. I loved living there. The unit was modern, had a good HOA, no issues with neighbors, and had 500/500 Webpass as the ISP (this was before fiber was commonplace and before Google Fiber purchased Webpass). The condo staged for sale. Why did I buy this place to begin with? I got it in 2015 when I was 29. I had been at Twitter for a few years and made some money from the Twitter IPO. I hated having roommates, and the alternative of paying $4,000–$5,000 a month to rent my own apartment didn't feel like a good idea. And at the time, it felt like you couldn't go wrong buying in San Francisco. More and more companies were becoming SF-based instead of Silicon Valley, and many friends and coworkers around me were buying homes too. I purchased it with 25% down and a 2.75% 7-year ARM mortgage from First Republic Bank (RIP, they were great). I figured seven years was plenty of time to either sell or refinance before the rates increased. That didn't help either. I moved to New York in 2019 and rented out my condo through a property management company that handled everything while I was out of state. I was in NYC for four years and lost money every month renting it out. Not to mention the property management company was horrible and a pain to deal with. My 7-year ARM's fixed period ended in mid-2022 while I was in New York while the rate was increasing monthly. By the time I sold the unit, my expired 2.75% ARM mortgage had exceeded 7.5%. It wasn't worth refinancing by then, I knew I wanted to sell it soon. My wife and I came back to San Francisco in 2023. That same horrible property management company forgot to have the tenant sign a lease (you had one job..), and the tenant ended up moving out unexpectedly a few months in. It lined up perfectly with the end of our apartment lease in New York, so we decided to head to San Francisco for a few months to fix up the condo, sell it, then head back to NYC. When we got back in January 2023, it wasn't a great time to sell, so we stayed. We didn't mind escaping the New York winter for a while, and the AI boom was starting to make SF feel alive again. We still love New York, but at the moment it really feels like if you work in tech and AI, you need to be here. The energy is palpable. We eventually got around to selling it at the start of 2025. I always thought selling it would be a hassle and that I would need to do upgrades to make it enticing. Well, it ended up being so much easier to sell than I expected. A former coworker introduced me to a small real estate agency; they were perfect. I dropped off the keys and they took it from there. They refinished the floors, upgraded some things in the bathroom, updated the heating system, painted, and staged. In less than two months, it sold. I received 11 offers: four competitive and three all cash. Even though I lost money on the sale all things considered, I had expected it to sell for considerably less given it was listed in January instead of the ideal time in spring. I learned my lesson with this place. I don't see myself purchasing a house in San Francisco anytime soon. The opportunity cost of the down payment alone stings. It would have tripled in a basic total U.S. stock market ETF over those 10 years. We've since been renting in Noe Valley for the last year. I finally have enough space and my own garage, so I moved over all of my stuff that had been stored with family: my Eames chair, Pro Display XDR, and old gear like this original iSight. Finding this rental was a huge challenge. Every evening for what felt like a year was spent scouring rental sites before we eventually found it off-market through a friend. At one point there was an apartment in Pacific Heights we loved so much we wrote a love letter (more common with purchases, not rentals), offered many months of cash up front, and even extra rent. There was just too much competition. I frequently hear from people saying they're moving to San Francisco in a month or two. My advice is always the same: start looking for your apartment as early as possible! 2025 started with an itch. After two and a half years of working on Rewind, then through its evolution to Limitless and the Limitless Pendant, I needed a change. I needed a new design and product challenge. In my time there, we really embodied what a startup is all about. We had a true customer focus, endless product iteration, countless product strategy refinements, and long hours sweating the details. We were a remote team of ~15-20 people in recent years. I was the only designer for a period and wrote about what this was like in The Startup Designer. The Limitless team at various offsites. We built a lot of stuff as we searched for product-market fit. Rewind was a native Mac app that captured everything you'd seen (via screen capture), said and heard (via opt-in meeting and audio recording), compressed it, and made it actionable. You could visually rewind time as well as search or ask AI to find anything you've seen. I loved that it had a local-first approach, private by design, and was a bit uncanny until you got used to it. An app that records your screen all the time? Crazy. But it worked. I would tell people that making Rewind was probably a similar user and marketing challenge to what the team at 1Password likely went through when they were starting out in the mid-2000s. "You want me to put all my passwords into this one app I'm supposed to trust with my digital life?" Crazy. But it worked. The Rewind Mac app. Bottom right: Rewind website I designed and built. We also made Rewind for iOS, then I spent some time diving into Windows development with C# and WinUI as we worked on a Windows app focused on using a local LLM. While the product had some challenges with search quality due to limitations from the local approach, I still think the Rewind concept is solid. Microsoft famously thought so too and created the Rewind-inspired Recall feature. There are some things I'd approach differently if Rewind were rebuilt from the ground up today: prioritize task-based workflows over pure recall, and explore using lightweight visual models for data classification. Rewind described on Lenny's podcast We then pivoted to a cloud-based product called Limitless, largely as a result of feeling limited by what we could achieve with Rewind's local-based approach. There was the cross-platform Limitless web and desktop app, and then the React Native mobile app. The Limitless.ai website I designed and built with lots of design details. My favorite detail was custom animating cursors when you selected a new Pendant color. Limitless started with meeting recording and summary functionality. That was a recurring use case people had with Rewind. While I personally felt that functionality wasn't the most exciting thing to work on, nor did it have staying power with countless meetings-focused competitors working on the exact same thing, we had an ambitious roadmap. The goal was to continually add more data sources over time for context. One of those data sources was to be our own hardware, the Limitless Pendant, to capture in-person meetings and conversations to help differentiate us from competitors. Early versions of Limitless for iPhone I designed. The Pendant was a bold bet, but after a year of building its companion app and dogfooding it, I realized it wasn't a product for me. I take privacy extraordinarily seriously and lean introverted, so I wasn't exactly comfortable wearing a recording device out of the house and asking for consent every time I encountered someone new. On top of that, my wife wasn't comfortable with me wearing it at home either. The product had real use cases, and we heard about that consistently from customers, but it wasn't for me. Meanwhile, the tech industry was exploding as LLM capabilities improved at a rapid clip and I felt like I was watching from the sidelines. Agents, deep research, multimodal models, new interaction paradigms... I wanted to be at the forefront of that. The opportunity cost felt too high. My heart wasn't in it, and I decided to leave. The Rewind and Limitless story came to a close some months later at the end of 2025 with a Meta acquisition. It felt like a great time for the team to join a larger company with the means to really compete with AI hardware and services coming out across the industry. It was a well-deserved exit for the team. Financially, I received a modest sum for shares I had early exercised, and for my vested in-the-money stock options. I had also previously sold some equity5 right after the company's last public round. I'll likely put some of it toward a few angel investments. I've done several angel investments in the past, mostly in crypto companies like Rainbow and XMTP (the messaging protocol now used by Coinbase Base and World). However, I've declined to do them more regularly because I feel that to do a good job, you need to have the time and bandwidth to stay on top of deal flow—seek it, meet the founders, and maybe you end up investing in 1 out of every 10+ teams you come across. After leaving Limitless, I gave myself permission to slow down before jumping into something new. I ended up taking four months off, though it didn't really feel like time off at all. I was meeting with founders, companies, and VCs for weeks, and also spent time I was working on my design portfolio.In hindsight I went overkill on the portfolio—I had two versions, the most comprehensive of which was 177 slides—but the act of doing it was a great way to reflect on how I worked, what gave me energy, and what drained it. My wife made the most of me no longer working nights and weekends, and we ended up taking a few trips. First to Germany and Austria, then later to Milan and Lake Como for a friend's birthday. Altaussee and Hallstatt, Austria. I haven't traveled with my big Sony a7R IV in some years. I get by with my iPhone, shooting in RAW and minor edits in Darkroom app. I stopped consuming caffeine entirely in 2025. It was during the trip to a medical health resort called MayrLife on Lake Altaussee, Austria that made that happen. This place was strict: a set schedule with strict meal times along with no caffeine or alcohol. The alcohol part was fine, but getting off of caffeine was a challenge. I had zero alcohol in all of 2024 and maybe just 5 drinks for all of 2025. I just don't really care for it anymore, and never loved the feeling of feeling something the next morning even if I only had two cocktails the night before. After the first full year of zero alcohol, it's like I was rewired and completely don't even care for alcohol anymore. I'll have some non-alcoholic beers and mocktails at times, of course. I had been used to having a 2-3 strong cups of coffee every day. I ended up having about 4 or 5 days of caffeine withdrawal migraines as I went cold turkey. After that, I decided I didn't want to go back to my normal coffee routine. I still love coffee and have a cup of decaf every morning though. I've learned all about the different kinds of decaf processes like Swiss Water Process (chemical free; the lowest caffeine but the worst taste) and Ethyl Acetate (best taste). My current decaf favorite is by Perc Coffee, but I'm still trying out others I'm discovering on the r/decaf subreddit. Lake Como, Italy. Went for my friend Ashley's birthday. After the initial withdrawal issues, staying off of caffeine wasn't that bad. Decaf coffee doesn't dehydrate you during the day, which is something I could feel. I used to rely on melatonin and sometimes magnesium to more easily fall asleep at night after a day of coffees, but now I don't need that either. The biggest downside is that while I love the flavor of coffee it's harder to find good decaf options at coffee shops. If they do have decaf, it's likely just one kind and only served as an americano, not pour over or brewed. I also took the time to hit reset and simplify a few other things in my life. On the nerdy side, I got rid of the two servers I had been running for a while. I had one server that managed this website's email newsletter, that I publish to very infrequently. I had been using a self-hosted web app called Sendy that uses AWS SES to send emails cheaply. I ditched that in favor of Kit. But between that and my other server I used to host my personal Mastodon instance, I hated having to login every few weeks to install an update or fix something. It's a small thing, but it freed up mental space.6 I stopped wearing my Apple Watch too. I was constantly annoyed by all the useless notifications and buzzing on my wrist. While I appreciated the health tracking functionality, I wanted to simplify. It didn't start as an overnight consciousness decision. I got a simple Casio F-91W watch, changed the strap and started wearing it some days. Eventually that became everyday. Half of what I appreciate is that it's not a smartwatch. The other half I appreciate is that it's just so small and lightweight. I wrote down what was critical to me as I started thinking about what I wanted in a new role. At the end of the day, I wanted to work with an exceptionally talented team, at the forefront of AI, with leadership and a CEO who genuinely care about quality, and as little organizational friction as possible between us and an outstandingly well-crafted product. I wasn't in a rush to find the next thing. I had time and wanted to optimize for seeing what was out there first. I'm often reminded of How To Be Successful by Sam Altman, where he writes: “I am willing to take as much time as needed between projects to find my next thing. But I always want it to be a project that, if successful, will make the rest of my career look like a footnote.” Being in San Francisco and being public about the fact that I was looking for my next thing was like a cheat code for that process. My days were filled as I met with several dozen founders, companies, VCs and friends. Every founder and team I met with had a unique perspective on where the world is heading, and they were fighting through the ambiguity to get there. It's still wild to me that this level of energy and ambition is just par for the course in San Francisco. I'm grateful to folks who took time to chat with me: A few things crystallized from all these conversations: All of this helped me articulate exactly what I wanted next after talking with small teams and large teams. I'm happiest, most productive, and most ambitious working on 0→1 products and bold bets that scratch at something new in AI, where there's a shared understanding of quality. I would much rather be the first designer tasked with creating an app or site from scratch than a designer or manager on a team of dozens responsible for just a sliver of an app. Not on a team of dozens optimizing something that already exists. I wanted to stay close to the craft while also growing a team. When I began this process, I actually thought I wanted to optimize for compensation and go to a late-stage, pre-IPO, or public company. I had always felt like you wanted to alternate between riskier early-stage startups and late-stage companies in your career so you wouldn't get "behind" with savings and investments. It became clear to me that was not where my heart was at all. I needed to work on something I was beyond passionate about with a team that shared that desire. Sesame ended up being everything I was looking for and more. It's been phenomenal across the board: the shared appreciation and ambition for excelling at craft, the remarkable team comprised of industry veterans, and the bold bets we're making on the product we're building. Yes… I know everyone says this about their company when they join, but that's really how I feel. I've never worked somewhere that truly cared about craft and understood it this much. A lot of that is due to the CEO, Brendan Iribe, who was one of the founders of Oculus VR. Brendan reached out after I published Browse No More. He's one of those founders I was alluding to in the previous section: someone who's really, really good at speaking about the importance of what the team is building, about taste, and about how great products are made. Sesame team offsite in Skamania, Washington I've been on enough teams to know that it really doesn't matter if various executives on the leadership team say quality matters. In my experience, it has to come directly from the CEO too. Brendan gets it; for software and for hardware. I later met the rest of the team, including the CPO Nate Mitchell (also one of the founders of Oculus VR), and it was clear this was a team I needed to work with. We're building both software and hardware. On the software side, we're building what we call personal agents. They're not productivity assistants, they're more like a collaborator and thought partner you just talk with. But even that description doesn't do our ambitions here justice. They're much more than that. We've been focusing on making them remarkably lifelike. That comes across in their unique personalities and how they carry the conversation. It's the sort of thing you need to experience to see what I mean: you can try our research preview released earlier in 2025 that over a million people have used. We're also working on an iOS app—you can get on the waitlist here. "This is not another productivity assistant. It's something different: a lifelike, expressive collaborator—designed to engage and evolve with its user over time." The second piece is hardware. We're making the world's best intelligent eyewear. They're fashion-forward and made for all-day comfort. Sequoia has more details on both our software and hardware in their article A New Era for Voice. The mission we talk about that I really love is that we're working towards bringing the computer to life with our hardware and focus on voice-first AI. We've been saying "software is eating the world" for 15 years now. Now as AI is eating software, hardware is becoming the new distribution and interaction frontier for AI. I'm not saying we won't have phones in 5 years (I still absolutely love mine), but I'm eager to spend time collaborating with the team here to see what these new interfaces will enable. "Hardware becomes a more popular moat (amid a surge of hardware startups). In a world where everyone can make their own software, unique products will emerge that tightly couple hardware and software." —Scott Belsky Sesame San Francisco one week when the NYC and Bellevue teams were visiting. Top: I'm on the left And after five years of almost entirely working from home, I'm thrilled to be back in an office. When covid started, I thought I'd never go back to the office. I loved having my own desk setup and being able to focus. Now I just miss working with people, whiteboarding design ideas, and perfecting prototypes right next to teammates. Also, teams building hardware kind of need to be in person with the number of physical prototypes we're continually crafting and testing out. It's been six months since I joined as Sesame's Head of Design, based out of our San Francisco office. My current day-to-day is heavy on design and code (Figma & Xcode for our iOS app)9 and helping out with things across product, hardware, brand, and marketing. We've got a lot in store for design this year across mobile, web, brand, and hardware. It's always a fun design challenge to work beyond just software product design. Basheer Tome joined my team to focus on hardware design, interaction design, prototyping, and everything in between. He had previously worked on Google Glass, Google Pixel Buds, autonomous driving, and all sorts of projects spanning PM, ID and CMF at Fellow. I'm looking forward to growing our design team this year. I'm the only software product designer at the moment10, and am looking to hire a seasoned product designer to work closely with me in our San Francisco office with a focus on visual design with a passion for craft and design engineering. We're hiring for quite a few different roles outside design too. I finally perfected my home office setup. For the two years prior I had a small desk in the bedroom at my previous place. Once we moved, I finally had space to build things out the way I wanted. I had room for my iMac G3 and vintage gadgets, a much larger 72x30" standing desk, and a lounge chair behind it. I also finally shipped my Pro Display XDR to San Francisco from where it had been in storage at my in-laws' house on the East Coast. iMac G3, Studio Display, Pro Display XDR, Glove80 keyboard, Uplift Standing Desk with custom LED lighting. For the last decade, I've had occasional wrist pain during extended computing sessions, but I have it under control these days with a combination of an adjustable desk (kept low enough so my elbows are properly angled), the Glove80 split ergonomic ortholinear keyboard, a Logi Lift vertical mouse, and a wrist brace for long sessions. Using a keyboard like the Glove80 (or similar models like the Kinesis Advantage2 I used before it) takes some getting used to, but it's worth it if you're in a similar boat with wrist pain from RSI. Separately, I try to use AI voice dictation apps like Aqua to speak instead of type when I can. I haven't quite built that habit yet. I've been thinking about getting a gooseneck desk mic for the office, like some other coworkers have, to do this more often. I've made a few other additions to my gear recently, but the standouts are my 333MHz Revision D iMac G3 from 1999, my original iSight camera, and my new OWC 4-bay M.2 SSD RAID enclosure. With the latter I've also started using Immich to manage my photos (hosted on my Mac, behind Tailscale) and will probably migrate my Google Photos to it. I've been meaning to post a much more in-depth article about the iMac. I updated the RAM, converted the HD to an SLC NAND flash CompactFlash card, and applied new thermal paste to the CPU heatsink. So much nostalgia. Ironically, I now work in the office on weekdays, so the setup doesn't get as much use anymore. I purchased a car for my commute, the newly redesigned 2025.5 Audi SQ5 SUV. I haven't had a car since I sold my E92 M3 about 7 years ago. Mechanically, it's great: quick, makes a nice sound, and overall fun to drive. The rest is just okay. The interior design leaves a lot to be desired. There's ugly piano black plastic everywhere and too many controls are touch-based. Driving to work… notice the check engine light that comes on and off randomly. Take it from me: don't buy the first year of a new car generation. But the icing on the cake is the garbage computer system. Not the infotainment system (though I really dislike that it lacks a traditional tachometer gauge cluster setting), but the whole car's computer system has been remarkably buggy. Various warnings and check engine lights constantly come on and then vanish on their own. I took it in for service just a month after I purchased it. They kept it for more than a week and the issues persisted. Others on Reddit are having similar problems and hope an upcoming software update will fix everything. I've definitely learned my lesson about buying a new generation car. Okay it's not an app, but I love taking notes, sketching UI designs and scratching off to-do list items in Mnemosyne x Kleid notebooks with my Baronfig Squire. I also love Uchida Le Pens for sketching too. I've gone through a few in 2025. Dia has been my primary browser for the majority of 2025. After living with Arc for the few years prior, I'm really accustomed to a browser with side tabs. I've tried to get into the ChatGPT Atlas browser and Perplexity's Comet browser but they never stuck for me, even with the promise of all their agentic functionality. I just don't really have a huge need to automate things just yet. Actually, I take that back, I would but the few times I've tried current solutions they were too slow and inaccurate. Maybe later in 2026. About 99% of what I have AI do in a browser for me is summarize long articles, and I use both Dia's integrated chat for that, and recently, Anthropic's Claude browser extension for that. I just hope that Dia keeps its craft and charm even after its parent company's acquisition by Atlassian. Flighty for insanely good flight tracking. I don't fly that much and this app is still worth every penny. I get notified of flight delays before the airlines send notifications. I can more easily look up alternate routes, see where the inbound plane is, and more. It's just a delightfully well-crafted app. Yuka lets you look up the health impact of various food and cosmetic items. My wife and I use it often to make better choices when shopping, such as avoiding harmful chemicals. There are a few apps like it but it's simple and works well. It does not have data about microplastics (you should definitely take a look at Nat Friedman's PlasticList) yet unfortunately, but other apps like Olive and Oasis Health do. These days we're much more mindful about what we bring into the house and have replaced pans with non-toxic ceramic ones, plastic cutting boards with oiled wood ones, avoiding certain dish detergents, et cetera. Mercury is hands down the best personal banking app and bank out there. There's an annual fee but you get a lovely, well-designed modern app with things like automatic transfer rules to move money around (e.g., don't keep cash in checking, always move to HYSA) and support for sending wires really easily. NetNewsWire combined with Feedbin is my RSS reader setup of choice. NNW has been around since I had a G4 Mac Mini in my college dorm in 2004. Great, simple piece of software. Though I do wish it had slightly more robust search functionality. Things has been my to-do list app for many years. Simple, well-built apps for desktop and phone. I have a few minor design gripes with it (what designer wouldn't have strong thoughts about their to-do list app) but it gets the job done. There's an unofficial Things MCP server I've been meaning to integrate into my workflow too. Raindrop is where I send articles I want to read later, curate design inspiration, save interesting links, and everything in between. It also saves a permanent copy of each link you bookmark so it's still accessible even if that page ceases to exist on the web. I try to go through it weekly to organize and review what I've saved. Obsidian (with the Cupertino theme) is my catch-all for daily notes and more. I pay for Obsidian Sync service too. While I have various folders for different types of documents from outlines and drafts of blog posts to documents for ideas, I primarily use it for work. I create a new file each week where I write notes for the week. At the bottom of each week's document I keep a running to-do list. At the end of each day I'll reprioritize that list or write down an action plan if I'm in the middle of a large task so I'm prepared the next morning. While I really love Obsidian, it's not perfect. Searching for files is really, really rough in my experience. I need to keep things in organized folders as I know I'll need to find them later and can't rely on search. Also, despite a robust developer community, there's not yet an amazing LLM solution. Fortunately everything in Obsidian is flat files, so I often use Claude Code with my Obsidian vault for things like synthesizing summaries and themes across a lot of files. And finally, the other thing I don't love about Obsidian is the mobile app navigation. It's likely a downside of it being a highly-extensible and cross-platform app, instead of a more opinionated native iOS app. Despite using all these apps for notetaking, saving, and curating, I don't really like the term second brain for this PKM stack. This quote below from I Deleted My Second Brain resonates with me to a degree, and I sometimes find myself saving things I never revisit. "The “second brain” metaphor misfits how human memory works: associative, embodied, and purposefully forgetful. When I first started using PKM tools, I believed I was solving a problem of forgetting. Later, I believed I was solving a problem of integration. Eventually, I realized I had created a new problem: deferral. The more my system grew, the more I deferred the work of thought to some future self who would sort, tag, distill, and extract the gold. That self never arrived."" 2025 was the year of coding agents for me (and everyone else too). It's a remarkable, remarkable tool. At the start of the year I mostly used Cursor for smaller tactical changes, but I quickly became heavily dependent on Claude Code. It just kept getting better throughout the year. "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like - something that in a loopy way strings together tool use and reasoning for extended problem solving. In addition, CC is notable to me in that it runs on your computer and with your private environment, data and context." —Karpathy There's many articles online on the proper way to configure and use Claude Code, how to put skills, agents, and CLAUDE.md to work for you, but this thread from the Claude Code creator in particular is worth a scroll: Tools like Claude Code still need constant babysitting and can sometimes get stuck in a loop, trying the same solutions that didn't work. I find it critical to try out other models regularly, even for the same task. For example, I get the feeling that Sonnet/Opus aren't amazing at more advanced or recent SwiftUI tasks. In a recent example it gave me the old GeometryReader hack for getting scroll offset from a ScrollView instead of the single .scrollPosition() modifier I wanted. These days I'm usually bouncing between Claude Code (usually via their official extension inside Cursor, which has nice expandable inline diffs) and Gemini 3 Pro via Cursor Agents. I don't have a set workflow. Sometimes I'll have Opus make a plan, then have GPT poke holes through it before Claude Code implements. I've also dabbled with tools like Conductor. Aside from the obvious desire for faster and smarter models that just nail each task, there's one thing I wish these tools were better at: undo. I know version control is technically my job. Git exists. But when I'm iterating quickly on a specific piece of functionality, I want to easily roll back to the last known good version without thinking about it. That's often from a previous agent response. I can leave a trail of commits behind me, but that doesn't look great on a PR. I can spend more time amending commits or dealing with git rebase, but that's friction I'd rather avoid. This feels like something these tools themselves should help with. Cursor, for example, doesn't have diffs for each agent response. If you want to undo the last change, you have to ask the LLM to do it, wait, and hope nothing else unexpected is changed in the process. Compare that to just discarding changes if you'd made a git commit. Much of what I do is design something from scratch in Figma, get it to around 90% or to a point where I have a few options I can't decide between without trying them out, and then begin building it. Figma is very much still a starting point. Lots of iteration—in aesthetics, interactions, and logic—happens while I'm building and feeling it out with real builds.11 For me that even meant going deep on working with metal shaders this past year: an area that seemed too complex to approach previously.12 However, I will sometimes use Figma MCP to help speed up parts of the development workflow. The act of building and testing out as you build is what design is all about to me. It rapidly surfaces new ideas for iterations and directions. There should have never been a design to engineering "handoff" phase. It's the same thing. Every designer should be a design engineer too. Being able to more rapidly build designs and interactions also means you no longer have to scratch your head trying to decide if you should come up with a long dissertation about why a certain piece of feedback from a peer or executive isn't worth pursuing. Most of the time, you can just try it out and see how it feels that day. Don't close off paths too soon. The biggest shift in design has not been on the visual design front for me. I don't necessarily need production assets with models like Nano Banano Pro, nor are there any UI design tools good enough yet to truly enhance my visual and UI design workflow… yet. I've tried to use them for coming up with design inspiration for things like iconography and brand design tasks at times, but haven't found anything that truly enhances my workflow yet. Designers need to push on what AI isn't good at yet. To me, that means constantly seeking inspiration, curating, and communicating well. Always be curious. You need to constantly be seeking information and inspiration. It can come from anywhere. Archive what feels good, interesting, or provocative to you. Hone your taste. The best designers I know are always curating. Some on Are.na and X. Some just in their own Figma moodboards. Some with link saving tools like Raindrop. Build that habit. With Claude Code, Cursor Agents, and dozens of other AI dev tools anyone can build for themselves now. We're entering the era of rapidly created, personalized and bespoke software. It's going to seem even more insane this year. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should. The hard part now isn't building. It's restraint in this world where we have more capabilities than ever. I've noticed this industry is a bit too trigger-happy to jump into Claude Code and start generating, then immediately commit what was one-shotted. Maybe we should all be doing our own product plan mode outside of Claude Code's plan mode. Taking a step back to ask what we're actually building and why before we start. It's too easy to skip the product thinking and strategy. That's the necessary but slow and hard work of deciding what should exist, why, and who it's for in the first place. What I'm referring to is just the normal product development process we've been doing for decades. Nothing new here. Just a reminder to not skip it when AI makes the building process closer and closer to a single button press. As I design things I'm continually in a loop asking myself things like: Similarly, even if AI does make something for you and does it well, quality can drop fast if you're not careful to polish and clean up everything afterwards. For code quality and product design quality. Always polish it yourself. That's where craft lives. Everyone's building some sort of agentic assistant right now. Connect your calendar. Integrate your email. Take actions. It all feels the same. A lot of assembled parts. Too many teams skip the hard parts: personality that builds trust, memory that truly enables continuity, and extensibility that meets you where you are. They also don't think enough about the why. Okay, so you can access my calendar… now when and why am I supposed to use this? That's why too many of these tools today feel like packaged slop. Personality and memory are what make these tools feel familiar and natural, not merely transactional. When GPT-4o was retired after GPT-5 launched, people were genuinely upset. They had gotten attached to how 4o wrote, how it felt. That's not nothing. As AI becomes more ubiquitous, more ambient—even worn—this will only matter more. Even in quick interactions, the wrong tone and style is immediately clocked. Personality, memory, and extensibility form the defining triad of future agentic systems that you'll want to use: It's time to stop thinking about building these systems as a series of LEGO bricks to slap together. 2025 was a lot of change compressed into twelve months—new job, new house, new daily habits. Most of it came down to getting rid of stuff, physically and mentally, that were getting in the way. Now I'm at Sesame working on problems I actually want to solve with people who care about the same things I do. This has been a lengthy article… a lot longer than I had originally planned. If you made it this far, thank you for reading. While I've been religiously saving interesting links and articles for inspiration in Raindrop, one thing I've started doing in the last year is maintaining a single markdown file where I paste interesting design-related quotes and related things. I wanted to close this article with a few of those. I always like to refer to old computer and operating system reference material and designs for inspiration. The creators of these systems started from what felt like a blank canvas, drawing on things like the desktop metaphor, to build what we have today. I try to get myself into the mindset they might have been in when thinking about the next generation of computing we'll have with AI. Palm webOS is a great one too… I got a Palm Pixi Plus recently: "People aren't trying to use computers—they're trying to get their jobs done." —Apple, Human Interface Guidelines: The Apple Desktop Interface (1987) On seeing things fresh and getting unstuck: "[…] looking closely at the micro level can unblock you for understanding the macro level. […] Pirsig's Brick is a tool for seeing things freshly “without primary regard for what has been said before” which creates that perfect tension of challenge and ability enabling flow." —Jordan Moore, How to Dismantle a Creative Wall "But there's a paradox at the heart of design that's rarely discussed: the discipline that most profoundly determines how lasting and inspiring a work of design can be is a designer's ability to look away — not just from their own work, but from other solutions, other possibilities, other designers' takes on similar problems. […] The most innovative solutions often come from designers who are aware of conventions but not beholden to them. […] This discipline of looking away preserves the singularity that makes great design resonant. When we constantly reference existing solutions, our work inevitably gravitates toward the mean. […] This is perhaps the most difficult discipline in design — harder than mastering software, harder than learning color theory, harder than understanding grids and proportions. It requires confidence to trust your own vision when countless examples of "how it's done" are just a search away. It demands the courage to pursue a direction that hasn't been validated by others. —Christopher Butler, Good Design Comes from Looking, Great Design Comes from Looking Away On design conviction: "There's an important rule of prototyping: find the fun first and build from there. In all of your brainstorming, you need to determine what is actually fun to play. Sometimes a really complex or interesting system is compelling to plan out, codify, and parse as an algorithm… but then turns out to be lackluster to engage with. Keep moving. Find this fun as fast as possible, and don't accept anything less. Your players won't either." —Andrew Zigler, MUD Cookbook: design meets implementation "Conviction often stands in opposition to market trends. To have conviction before validation may make you seem weird or delusional, but it defines great artists—the ability to appreciate what others overlook or even fight against." —Willem Van Lancker, Design Literacy "Hayden, you can't change the world. It's not possible. All you can do is try to make your own world and then invite other people to be a part of it." —George Lucas to Hayden Christensen On soul: In its purest form, design is poiesis. It is drawing ideas from the ether. It's a Muse. "Beautifully designed products without soul, are just that: representational garden art. In all of our history, we've never had more money to design beautiful, functional and usable products. The bar is higher than ever, yet, they've never been more boring and devoid of soul." —Steyn Viljoen, Beautiful, boring, and without soul On software today, especially with this era of personalized software: "software isn't just functional anymore. it's quietly turned into a lifestyle brand, a digital prosthetic we use to signal who we are, or who we wish we were.[…] people don't just use these apps. they use them to imagine themselves differently. more organized. more intentional. more in control. apps like superhuman or linear aren't just tools, they're lifestyle upgrades. software that feels like a reward. a signal that you care about your time, your taste." —you are what you launch: how software became a lifestyle brand "We stopped doing the real thing that would be the most empathetic, useful, and that would actually serve business outcomes best: building stuff that worked well and that people would love." —Jenny Wen, Don't trust the (design) process As for books, I did not read much at all in 2025 and really need to change that in 2026, similar to my 2017 goal of reading 24 books. I'm currently reading The Soul of A New Machine and The History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality. I'll probably find more from this list of books mentioned on Hacker News. 1 After 20 years, I finally got my G4 Mac Mini back. The person I sold it to reached out after noticing my gear pages where I've been collecting vintage gadgets and asked if I wanted my old Mac Mini back. I need to add it to my gear section. I have an old Intel Mac Mini too. 2 I've been running this site for half my life. These days I mainly just try to keep my gear pages updated frequently, and then only focus on an article when I have some topic I want to go deep on, a perspective I think is unique and worth unpacking, or generally just something I want to nerd out on. That tends to mean about one longer article per year, which is fine with me. Work consumes a lot of my time and I'm passionate about designing and building great products. 3 Also, I've worked with too many people who use their past experiences as the primary input for a decision. That's not only the wrong approach all too often, but it also makes everyone around them resent their unwillingness to consider new ideas and perspectives (or even just entirely different culture, values, quality, people). Not to mention.. do you know how annoying it is to keep hearing, "When I was at [company], we did X."? I always, always try to catch myself when I'm about to say that about my time at Twitter or another past company. 4 Even with fresh daily contacts, they're still nowhere near as comfortable as glasses on my eyes. Glasses are just easier and I've started collecting eyewear I really like, such as Mr. Leight and Lindberg. 5 Not being emotional with investments like that and being quick to diversify is something I learned after being at Twitter for 9 years where the stock was performing pretty poorly most of the time. Whenever I'd vest new RSUs and have an open trading window I'd immediately sell them. The logic there was "if you had $X in cash right now, would you go out and buy Twitter stock?" The answer for me was usually no. 6 Mastodon didn't quite pan out. I got really excited about the prospect of owning and hosting my own social media back when the Twitter exodus began in 2023… but it was never quite as active over there (same with Threads and Bluesky), and I still prefer Twitter/X. 7 I stopped the process with one company after meeting the CEO I would have worked with who lacked that energy. Instead, it felt like they sucked all the energy from the conversation. 8 5-10 years ago it felt like there was a wave of designers that figured success was going on the management track early (after sometimes just 2 years as an IC) when on a large team and we had bloated teams with too many managers that slowly lost touch of craft over time. Now they're having a hard time getting back into IC. Similarly, designers that don't do well with 0-1 design from scratch, for example without relying on existing design systems, will have a harder time operating on these smaller, craft-focused teams. AI tools today can't help that much on the visual design side, and people lacking those foundational skills will need to find ways to adapt. 9 My 2.5 years endlessly designing, building, then redesigning and rebuilding every part of my app Stocketa prepared me well for sweating the front-end details.

Technology The market cap of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) is more than twice as much as that of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META). Nvidia has a huge advantage in that it almost single-handedly powers the AI revolution. Sending You to Google News in 3 © ipopba / iStock via Getty Images Its $4.5 trillion market cap makes Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) the most valuable company in the world. That puts it well ahead of Apple and Alphabet, which have market caps near $3.9 trillion. What is more staggering is that even if Nvidia’s market cap dropped 50%, it would be worth slightly less than Amazon ($2.6 trillion) and much more than Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META) ($1.6 trillion). This shows the huge advantage of being the company that powers the AI revolution almost single-handedly. Nvidia may be known as an arms dealer. That is, it provides companies at war over artificial intelligence with the one thing they absolutely must have. Without its chips, none of the big players can build their arsenals to pound away at one another. From Meta to Microsoft to OpenAI or Grok, none has a huge revenue base that is growing at a rate of 60% a year, a number that could accelerate. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia’s revenue rose 62% year over year to $57 billion. Earnings were up 67% to $1.30 per share. Note that at Nvidia’s current revenue growth, the company could be larger in revenue than Apple is within two years. Nvidia is also picking off parts of the AI revolution via investments. It has investments in 138 companies, most of which are in the AI industry. This includes CoreWeave, ARM, Applied Digital, OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI. Its investments alone must be worth at least tens of billions of dollars. Nvidia has finally been able to sell products to China, which is second only to the United States in AI development. This move could bring the company tens of billions of dollars in sales. CEO Jensen Huang puts the figure at $50 billion. Nvidia reportedly has over 90% of the AI chip segment worldwide. That figure is unlikely to change soon. Nvidia is worth more than twice as much as Meta because Meta is a combatant to which it sells bullets.

Title: 5 Once-Sleepy Dividend Utility Companies Are Striking Massive Deals With Big Tech

Investing Growth and income investors looking for a safer way to play the AI and data center explosion have found an avenue with utility stocks. Many top U.S. utility companies have already cut landmark deals with big-tech giants. Paying dependable dividends and offering long-term safety for investors, top utility stocks make sense in a growth and income portfolio. Sending You to Google News in 3 © zhongguo / Getty Images Big tech companies are increasingly striking direct deals with utilities to secure reliable, long-term energy supplies as their power needs surge, driven mainly by data centers, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. These agreements often include power purchase agreements for renewable energy, such as wind and solar, allowing tech firms to lock in stable prices while helping utilities finance new generation and grid upgrades. In some cases, companies are also partnering with utilities on energy storage, transmission expansion, and even next-generation sources like small modular nuclear reactors to ensure around-the-clock power. For utilities, these deals provide guaranteed demand and investment capital. At the same time, tech companies offer energy security, cost predictability, and progress toward sustainability goals—making the partnerships strategically crucial for both sides. We decided to screen our 24/7 Wall St. utility stocks research database to identify the top companies in the sector that have already struck substantial deals with some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent players. Surging demand for electricity, which will only continue to grow, has made some of America’s oldest and best utility companies one of the best investments for growth and income investors who would like to participate in the AI/data center revolution but would rather play it from a safer angle. What could be a better avenue than utility stocks that pay dependable, and in some cases large, dividend payments every quarter? Five top companies that we have covered for years may be perfect stocks for Boomer and Gen X investors, and all are rated Buy at the top Wall Street firms we cover. This off-the-radar utility stock is an ideal choice for growth and income investors, with its hefty 3.93% dividend yield. Brookfield Renewable Corp. (NYSE: BEPC) operates renewable power platforms and sustainable solutions. The company has signed a framework with Microsoft to develop over 10.5 GW of new renewable energy capacity from 2026 to 2030, and also has a hydro framework agreement with Google. The company’s portfolio comprises hydroelectric, wind, solar, and storage facilities across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. It has approximately 33,000 megawatts of installed capacity and a development pipeline with approximately 155,400 megawatts. Brookfield Renewables businesses include: Morgan Stanley has an Overweight rating with a $48 target price. This is one of the top companies in the industry, and it has already completed some huge forward deals. With a small 0.45% dividend, Constellation Energy Inc. (NYSE: CEG) is a growth story for sure. It is a producer of emissions-free energy and an energy supplier to businesses, homes, and public sector customers nationwide. The company has secured 20-year power purchase agreements with both Microsoft and Meta Platforms, including the entire 1,121-megawatt output of its Clinton Clean Energy Center nuclear plant to power a Meta data center. The company’s nuclear, hydro, wind, and solar generation facilities have a generating capacity equivalent to powering 16 million homes and provide about 10% of the nation’s clean energy. Its segments include: Through its integrated business operations, it sells electricity, natural gas, and other energy-related products and sustainable solutions to various types of customers, including distribution utilities, municipalities, cooperatives, and commercial, industrial, public-sector, and residential customers across multiple geographic regions. The company’s nuclear fleet has a generating capacity of approximately 22 gigawatts (GWs). It operates approximately 10 GW of natural gas, oil, hydroelectric, wind, and solar generation assets. TD Cowen has a Buy rating with a $440 target price. Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE: D) is an integrated energy utility that offers electricity, natural gas, and related services. Many of the Wall Street firms we cover are positive on utilities, and this company pays a strong 4.62% dividend. The company has received requests to supply 47.1 gigawatts of power to data centers in Virginia, a major data center market, as part of a $50 billion capital investment plan from 2025 to 2029. Dominion Energy operates through four segments: The Dominion Energy Virginia segment generates, transmits, and distributes regulated electricity to residential, commercial, industrial, and governmental customers in Virginia and North Carolina. The company has received requests to supply 47.1 gigawatts of power to data centers in Virginia, a major data center market, as part of a $50 billion capital investment plan from 2025 to 2029. The Gas Distribution segment engages in: This segment serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers. The Dominion Energy South Carolina segment generates, transmits, and distributes electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers in South Carolina. Dominion serves approximately 7 million customers, and the company’s portfolio of assets includes approximately: Barclays has an Overweight rating with a $64 target price. This energy company primarily engaged in electric power production and retail distribution in the Deep South of the United States. This top utility stock always makes sense for conservative investors, and Entergy Corp. (NYSE: ETR) pays a solid 2.64% dividend. The company produces and distributes electricity in the United States and is embarking on building two new 1.5 GW gas-fired power plants to supply Meta’s $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana, with $41 billion in planned investments. It operates in two segments: The Utility segment generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric power in the City of New Orleans, as well as portions of: The company also distributes natural gas. The Entergy Wholesale Commodities segment is involved in: The company generates electricity through gas, nuclear, coal, hydro, and solar sources. It sells energy to retail power providers, utilities, electric power co-operatives, power trading organizations, and other power generation companies. Its power plants have approximately 24,000 megawatts (MW) of electric generating capacity, which includes 5,000 MW of nuclear power. J.P. Morgan has a $108 target price for the stock. This top company is among the highest-rated utility stocks on Wall Street, and it pays a dependable 2.79% dividend. NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE) is an electric power and energy infrastructure company. It is working with Google on developing gigawatt-scale data center campuses and will generate 2.5 GW of solar projects for Meta. NextEra also agreed to a 25-year deal with Alphabet to acquire 3 GW of energy from a redeveloped nuclear facility. NextEra operates through its wholly owned subsidiaries, NextEra Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Transmission (collectively, NEER), and Florida Power & Light Company (FPL). The FPL segment is a rate-regulated electric utility that generates, transmits, distributes, and sells electric energy in Florida. FPL has approximately 35,052 megawatts of net generating capacity, over 91,000 circuit miles of transmission and distribution lines, and 921 substations. The NEER segment owns, develops, constructs, manages, and operates electric generation facilities in wholesale energy markets in the United States and Canada and includes assets and investments in other businesses with a clean energy focus, such as battery storage, natural gas pipelines, and renewable fuels. It owns, develops, constructs, and operates rate-regulated transmission facilities in North America. J.P. Morgan has an Overweight rating and a $97 price target.

Title: The report on the blackout, the Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting in Riyadh, Jumbo will also sell cigarettes, the One and Only and the permits

Greetings, if 2026 began dynamically with the “seizure,” in a cinematic manner, of Maduro by the American army, do not think that many days will pass before we experience something equally spectacular on the international stage. Perhaps this will be the fall of the savage Islamic regime of the Mullahs of Tehran, which does not even require Trump to lend a hand: after so much violence and oppression over 50 years, the people are in the streets, the dead according to international sources are already in the hundreds, and it now seems difficult for Khamenei to endure. Now, what will happen afterward… here is where things get difficult, because as you will remember, after the Arab Spring came the hell of ISIS. Still, we seem to be heading toward the fall of the Iranian regime, even if in a second phase. More difficult for us Europeans will be Trump’s other great “occupation,” the conquest of Greenland, even if by buying out its inhabitants—unbelievable, right? Greenland formally belongs to Denmark, you see, therefore it is in some way EU territory, so there things become complicated for us as Europeans. We will have an exceptionally interesting year in 2026 with all this, but let us not forget that President Trump’s imperium will be tested (this year as well), because there are midterm elections in the U.S., so it will become clear whether his momentum will be cut short or not. Farmers – K.M. On domestic matters, Mitsotakis left for Madrid, where today he will meet with Pedro Sánchez on a visit that I do not know, beyond protocol, why it is happening now, although a similar one between the two heads of government last took place about 13 years ago. He will return in the evening to meet with our honored farmers on Tuesday at the Maximos Mansion, where logically the issue will also be closed, since, as we said, in a few days the real farmers—not those who will go to Maximos—begin work in the fields. Report on the airport blackout Within the week, the report of the Committee investigating what happened at the beginning of the month, when the communication system between airports and airplanes went down, is also expected. My source says they are almost certain it was a hardware failure—in plain Greek, that the system broke down because it is ancient. If what happened is what seems almost certain, Mitsotakis has, in my opinion, one thing to do: cancel whatever tender is running (or almost running…) and bring in an urgent piece of legislation for reasons of national security and citizens’ safety, with direct assignment to whoever has such systems, guided by speed and technical competence. Nothing less or more. And what Dimas says, that the upgrades will be completed by 2028, I hear as a huge mistake, without of course blaming the minister, who has not been there for more than a year. The office visit and Tragakis’s daughter Let me convey two snapshots from K.M.’s visit on Saturday afternoon to the ND offices on Piraeus Street on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his election to the leadership. The first thing the prime minister did upon arriving was to take the elevator up to his office on the third floor of the building, where he will obviously return during the pre-election period of 2027. Otherwise, there were greetings and short huddles, while the “lifelong” Giannis Tragakis was walking arm in arm with his daughter, Argyro Tragakis, who is destined for the ballot of Piraeus B. Indeed, Tragakis’s daughter has also had a relevant meeting with K.M. for weeks now. President Nikos, the unmoving needle, and Pavlos’s eviction And we move on to PASOK matters, where the unmoving needle is driving MPs and party officials crazy, day in and day out—those who want to claim a parliamentary seat but see no progress on the “green” horizon. The percentages remain stuck and disappointing, mainly in the electoral districts of Attica, where the appearance of Alexis makes President Nikos’s life even more difficult. Tsipras has his own “little problems” in the region, where Karystianou is entering the game with… momentum—if the momentum turns out, of course, to be of… Popi (that pre-election 2023 moment when Tsapanidou saw something that citizens did not see in SYRIZA’s dynamics), the former prime minister may hope that the times will turn (in his favor). President Nikos, on the other hand, sees the dream of second place in the basin drifting away and being lost, slowly but steadily. Even if the ranking order of ’23 is simply repeated, PASOK will once again see the back of the KKE and end up in fourth place. The current MPs, apart from the unmoving and single-digit needle, also have to contend with new “players” entering their area. Diamantopoulou decided to run in South Athens aiming for first place, since one seat for PASOK is considered certain, the one secured last time by Pavlos Christidis. President Nikos was also a candidate in southern Athens, but preferred to keep the seat in Thessaloniki A and push out Haris Kastanidis. Now? The “nice” thing is that some hard-core Androulakis supporters, who take for granted the candidacy of President Nikos (without a preference vote) in some district of Attica, do not rule out any scenario—even the one that has Androulakis running in Athens A. With one seat for PASOK, and if Androulakis keeps it, Pavlos Geroulanos will be left out… It is an extreme scenario and yet it is circulating, and if nothing else it describes the… fierce intentions of the presidential camp against their intra-party opponents. The other scenario being heard says that Androulakis will run “opposite” his intra-party rival, Manolis Christodoulakis, in East Attica. If he does not do so, he may field Nikos Milis and throw the entire party machine behind him, aiming at the methodical erosion of Christodoulakis’s momentum. A mess… President Maria… Otherwise, President Maria has properly entered the party’s trip, because I see and read that she now makes political statements wherever she stands and wherever she goes, one per day. Various people have appeared attaching themselves to Karystianou and praising her publicly, such as the pianist Farantouris, Zakri, who sees that Kasselakis might… leave politics and not know where else to go herself, and other desperate figures. She is undeniably the most interesting figure at the beginning of the new year because, despite what she said… as if something bit her, she decided to press the button and announced a party, whereas she could have waited. Some tell me she was convinced that Mitsotakis will allegedly call elections before the start of the Tempi trial. Everyone in the world can of course believe whatever they want, but K.M. is the last person to be thinking about elections, not even about a reshuffle. In the coming days, polling will also begin, and it will be interesting to see what Maria’s needle does as a party leader and not as the sympathetic mother of Tempi. The symbolism of Pierrakakis’s announcement On Friday night, Kyriakos Pierrakakis announced, with his new capacity as president of the Eurogroup, the six candidates for the position of Vice President of the European Central Bank. Among them were two names that were anything but unknown in Greece during the decade of the crisis: Olli Rehn and Mário Centeno, who are seeking a recommendation from the Eurogroup to the European Council, in a process that requires a 72% majority of eurozone member states. It is recalled that the Finnish politician served in 2010, at the outbreak of the crisis, as Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Euro (with the legendary “good luck” at the first memorandum), while the Portuguese served as president of the Eurogroup in 2018, after Jeroen Dijsselbloem. And while Pierrakakis is not the only one responsible for their selection, still, it has its symbolism that it is the Greek finance minister who announces their candidacies. From transatlantic flights to Riyadh For those who are watching, it does not go unnoticed that Stavros Papastavrou until today was almost a permanent passenger on planes heading to the other side of the Atlantic. Contacts in the U.S. consistently focused on an energy mix with fossil fuels at the center: hydrocarbon exploration with American giants ExxonMobil and Chevron and LNG imports. The minister has been in Riyadh since yesterday, making his first trip to an Arab country since taking office. Officially, his presence in Saudi Arabia is linked to a conference on critical raw materials. Behind the scenes, however, it is considered a given that during his stay there will be contacts with clear energy interest. Saudi Arabia has the rare triptych of capital, geopolitical weight, and strategic alliance—elements that are hard to ignore when major projects are on the table. At the center is the Greece–Saudi Arabia electricity interconnection, a high-demand project being worked on by ADMIE and National Grid, which aspires to open a new energy corridor between Europe and the Arabian Peninsula. What is sought at this stage is not technical details, but whether and to what extent there is political and investment appetite to move forward. At the same table, a more cautious reference to an even more complex project may also be made: the Greece–Cyprus interconnection, especially given that interest from the Arab side is not unknown. It is recalled that in December 2023 Cyprus signed a Memorandum of Understanding with state-owned TAQA, with the participation of ADMIE, to promote investments in the Cyprus–Crete electricity interconnection. But with the project’s problems, all these agreements went out the window. It is no coincidence that, according to his interlocutors, Stavros Papastavrou often points out that the participation of investors from other countries in the share capital of the cable can contribute decisively to managing balances, especially in projects with complex geopolitical issues such as the GSI. Papastavrou will have bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of energy, Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and the minister of industry and mineral resources, Bandar bin Ibrahim Al Khorayef, as well as with executives of major Saudi groups operating internationally, including Dar Global, Quara Holding, and Alireza. Papastavrou–Eric Trump meeting As part of the official visit mentioned above, which he has been making since yesterday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Stavros Papastavrou met yesterday with Eric Trump, the second son of the President of the United States. Eric, together with his brother, is responsible for the Trump Organization, which is developing intense business activity in Saudi Arabia and more broadly in the Middle East. As part of his presence in the country, the minister was invited to and attended the inauguration ceremony of the new projects being implemented by the Trump Organization in Riyadh and Jeddah. Prayers did not reach the Supreme Court The well-known businessman Pantelis Mantonanakis, who invokes Saint Stylianos as his protector, found himself facing adverse developments. His prayers and efforts bore no result. With the recent decision AP 17/2026, the Supreme Court (Areios Pagos) rejected the application for annulment he had filed, through which he challenged the “abusive,” as he claimed, termination of his loans by creditors in 2019. This decision now leaves the way open for forced execution against his hotel units, which are entering the center of liquidation proceedings. Jumbo will also sell cigarettes Jumbo decided to distribute an extraordinary cash dividend of €0.50 per share to its shareholders and for this reason is calling an extraordinary general meeting on February 4. There is, however, another issue to be discussed. It concerns the amendment of Article 4 (“Purpose”) of the company’s articles of association. What is changing? Jumbo decided that it will be able to sell tobacco products, including new tobacco products, electronic cigarettes, and all related smoking items. Other activities are also being added to the articles of association, such as the provision of storage and distribution services (logistics), the production of electricity from photovoltaic systems, leasing and maintenance services for owned and leased properties not intended for residence, and the purchase and sale of owned real estate. Particularly the latter appears to be of great interest, and it remains to be seen what exactly it αφορά… Tiresias–Equifax: The cooperation still has a long way to go Major projects have been launched at Tiresias. The first step was the conclusion of a strategic commercial partnership with Equifax, a leading global Credit Bureau specializing in data, analytics, and technological solutions for decision-making. Through this commercial partnership, Tiresias, whose CEO is Ilias Xirouchakis, will support businesses and financial institutions in credit-related decisions through cutting-edge technological systems that will utilize Tiresias’s reliable data. The cooperation with Equifax became possible because after three years Tiresias returned to profitability, and the beginning comes with the provision of four categories of products. It appears that Tiresias will soon move into advisory services, while expansion into other products is also planned. In the market it is said, without confirmation, that the two companies—as the cooperation matures—may move jointly abroad, something that possibly explains why a group of Equifax’s caliber took an interest in the Greek market of 20 million. HSBC: Warns of overheating of the Athens Stock Exchange HSBC issued a clear warning about the overheating of the Greek stock market. In a report, the investment bank recommends that investors reduce their exposure to the Greek market in 2026. Put more simply, to start taking their profits, estimating that the strong rally of recent years (the General Index stands at +140% over the six-year period 2020–2025) has now exhausted the margins for further upside. HSBC stresses that the positive elements of the Greek economy—fiscal stability, improvement in bank indicators, and reforms—have already been priced into valuations, limiting future catalysts. At the same time, it aligns with other houses that argue that Greece’s transition from emerging to developed market status, although institutionally positive, may in the short term cause significant capital outflows, as several funds will be forced (also due to their statutes) to divest. HSBC warns that many Greek stocks risk losing their visibility in international indices, reducing investment interest. Overall, the bank sees 2026 as a year of increased risks and lower returns for the Greek market, with the risk–return balance deteriorating markedly compared to previous years. Agricultural electricity: The price of €0.085 cannot be reduced further The price of electricity for agricultural use, through the GAIA tariff, has now definitively “locked in” at €0.085 per kilowatt-hour, with no possibility of further reduction. Sources with knowledge of the matter state that this price constitutes a final arrangement and cannot be readjusted, definitively closing the relevant discussion. Nevertheless, public debate continues with requests for additional reductions which, according to the available data, are not supported by economic or regulatory grounds. The assessment of the €0.085 price requires—as the same sources emphasize—examining the overall regime of charges and exemptions applicable to agricultural electricity, and not only the nominal kilowatt-hour price. According to calculations arising from the current framework for the tariff’s application, farmers are not burdened with transmission and distribution network usage fees (ADMIE, DEDDIE), do not pay special consumption tax, and pay significantly reduced charges for Public Service Obligations (PSO) and ETMEAR (RES levy) compared to other consumers. The result is a real energy cost many times lower than that of household tariffs. In practice, if the net energy cost of a household consumer with a green tariff is indicatively depicted as “10,” the corresponding cost for the agricultural tariff does not exceed “4.” This is a difference that places agricultural electricity in the lowest pricing tier among professional categories. A similar picture emerges from comparison with the Social Household Tariff B, under which approximately 300,000 beneficiaries fall. Based on current prices, farmers until now paid a comparable cost to beneficiaries of the social tariff. With the new price of €0.085, they will now pay less than the SHT, despite being a professional group that uses electricity to generate income and not as a measure of social protection. According to calculations based on average professional and household tariffs, agricultural electricity is today among the lowest-priced electricity for productive use, not only nationally but also at a European level. This picture arises both from nominal prices and from final charges after regulated fees. In this context, the issue of electricity cost is expected to be raised again at Tuesday’s meeting between the government and farmers, although—according to the same sources—there is no margin for renegotiating the price. The meeting may also be attended by the CEO of PPC, Giorgos Stassis, lending additional institutional weight to the process. With these δεδομένα, the agricultural electricity component appears to have essentially closed, with the discussion now shifting to the remaining open issues facing the farming community, from trade agreements and international competition to the broader structural challenges of the primary sector. One & Only Kea wants to expand – The reactions The file for the expansion of the One & Only Kea Island of the international Kerzner group on Kea is scheduled to pass this week through the review of the competent authorities of the Ministry of Culture, specifically the Central Archaeological Council, and it remains to be seen whether it will be a… walk in the park or not. This concerns the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) that has been submitted for increasing the capacity of the island’s five-star resort from 330 to 565 beds, along with a “redesign of the layout of the existing villas/bungalows” and “grouping accommodation into smaller ‘clusters’ of residences.” It is noted here that the sale of residences worth several million euros is being promoted by Dolphin Capital Partners of Miltiadis Kambouridis, which is also participating as an investor in the project. As noted in the EIS, “the units are organized into clusters of small hubs, with rows/clusters including 3–8 residences per group, in order to maintain a sense of dispersion and reduce visual mass compared to a large, compact development,” for a project that is also strengthened with additional infrastructure for wellness, sports activities, port facilities with the placement of floating platforms, additional swimming pools, expansion of the desalination unit, a helipad, etc. The EIS submitted for approval also refers to changes in volumes and heights in specific sections, with the maximum permitted height in certain zones increasing from approximately 7.5 meters to sections reaching 10.5–15 meters, serving “the integration of larger or two-story/modified units and auxiliary spaces,” with height changes characterized as critical “for visual intensity and for the footprint on the landscape.” For the expansion, however, indicative are the (not few) comments and objections during the consultation of the relevant EIS (completed in early December 2025) from local bodies and residents, who speak of significant strain on the island’s carrying capacity, unequal distribution of natural resources, disproportionately negative impacts on elements of the natural environment, etc. As noted indicatively, “according to data from the Hellenic Chamber of Hotels for the year 2023, the island had a total of 584 beds.” The creation of the Integrated Tourist Resort for One & Only Kea Island “initially increased this number by 56.5%, while the proposed modification with the additions will almost double the island’s original number of beds.” In addition, the new design does not take into account “the disproportionate burden on water consumption on the island during the summer months, which often reaches the point where prolonged interruptions in the municipal water supply network are observed, as well as phenomena of salinization and/or silty contamination,” while reference is also made to the “underestimation of helicopter flights and their impacts.” Movement Competition is growing, good people are not lost, and thus Stavros Karagrigoriou, former CFO of Ethniki Asfalistiki (National Insurance), is heading toward Minetta Insurance, within the framework of the insurer’s restructuring. S. Karagrigoriou remains one of the capable executives of the insurance market, has many years of experience in financial services, and joined the workforce of Ethniki Asfalistiki in 2016 assuming the role of CFO. Administrative changes at the company, within the framework of the new shareholder structure, resulted in his departure. Nicolas with the 27 ships and the $250 million cash pile Contships Logistics, interests of Nicolas Pateras, once again confirms its strong position in the feeder containership sector, strategically and consistently exploiting the opportunities presented by the secondary market. The recent sale of five vessels to Medkon Lines and Metrostar Management brings more than $60 million into the company’s coffers, while the vessels are accompanied by existing charter contracts with major liner companies, ensuring their value and immediate returns. The company, which started in 2015 with a limited investment in the feeder sector, today has a fleet of 27 vessels with no debt, while cash reserves are expected to rise to approximately $250 million after the latest sales of the five vessels, which will be used for new investments. Nicolas Pateras has proceeded with ship sales at particularly profitable prices, taking advantage of the rise in the charter market, while at the same time renewing the fleet with newer vessels, without borrowing and with stable dividends for shareholders. Also significant is the return of Metrostar of Panagiotis and Dimitris Angelopoulos to the containership sector after approximately 15 years. The acquisition of two feeders from Contships marks its dynamic re-entry and its intention to exploit opportunities in this sector, demonstrating confidence in the quality of the Greek shipowner’s fleet and transactions. These moves confirm Pateras’s ability to manage the fleet and investments with consistency and strategic planning. Contships remains focused on fleet renewal, liquidity, and reliability toward major liner companies, while the market watches the entry of new players such as Metrostar, showing that the momentum of Greek shipping in containerships continues. Pistiolis and the sale of the mega yacht “San Lorentzo” The transfer of the under-construction mega yacht San Lorenzo, with scheduled delivery in the second quarter of 2027, by the U.S.-listed company TOP Ships is not a lifestyle issue, but a purely business decision. Evangelos Pistiolis chooses to remove from the company an asset that is not connected to its core role, namely tankers. Specifically, with the sale of the special purpose company to Rubico Inc., which is the contracting party to the shipbuilding agreement for the newbuild vessel, for $38 million, TOP Ships “locks in” value and avoids future capital commitments until the vessel’s delivery in 2027. At the same time, it transfers to a third party the risk of delays or cost overruns in construction. For the market, the message is simple: management does not invest in assets that do not directly enhance revenues and the image of the listed company. DFC and the second disbursement for investments at the Elefsina shipyards Within February, the disbursement of the second tranche of the total $125 million loan from the U.S. state development bank, DFC, for the Elefsina shipyards is expected. At the same time, a visit by a bank delegation to Greece is planned, further strengthening the cooperation. ONEX is preparing to submit within the coming days the application for the second tranche, estimated at approximately $30 million, securing as collateral the two floating docks of Syros. Investments at Elefsina are progressing according to plan and timetable, with projects including, among others, the creation of new infrastructure networks, the renovation of gantry cranes, as well as the modernized renewal of electrical and mechanical installations. The progress of the works appears to be entering an accelerated pace, marking a critical phase for upgrading the shipyards and strengthening the Greek shipbuilding industry. Farmers’ roadblocks helped consumption in urban centers Unexpected assistance from farmers’ mobilizations was received by retail trade in major urban centers during the festive period. Christmas turnover reached €5 billion and conceals an asymmetric distribution: while the regions were bleeding, commercial shops (as well as food service) in major urban centers saw traffic and turnover increase. Difficulties in transportation trapped consumers who would have left for the regions for the holidays. At the same time, the cost of “last-minute” airline tickets abroad skyrocketed to prohibitive levels. The result was visible: thousands of Athenians and Thessalonians who would have been away remained in their cities and channeled their spending into the local market. Ermou Street, Aristotelous Square, and the malls experienced days of high footfall. Data from the Hellenic Confederation of Commerce show that 45% of businesses that significantly increased their turnover during the holidays are concentrated mainly in urban centers, while the regions paid the price of “trapped consumption.” A stock market of the few and the strong The recap data of the fifth consecutive year of growth that led the Athens Stock Exchange into the embrace of Euronext reveal a market with a strong concentration of power in a few large players. In 2025, Piraeus Group Securities dominated with a 23.63% market share and transactions exceeding €240 billion. The top trio of brokerage firms is completed by Eurobank Equities (17.26%, €155 billion) and Euroxx (12.42%, €35 billion). Notable is the presence of Alpha Finance in fourth place (8.18%), while National Securities follows with the same percentage, showing that the four systemic banks control nearly 62% of the market. UBS Europe (6.38%) in sixth place represents the international dimension of the market. From there downward, the picture shows a fragmented space with dozens of smaller players sharing percentages of 1% and below. In the new Euronext era, for a brokerage firm to be a Prime Broker it needs share capital from €5 million (for equities) to €10 million (for derivatives) and €100 million to operate in the bond market. The money required is substantial and the Greek market is small, making it difficult to sustain such sizes. Everyone is awaiting the first signs from the new president of ATHEX to trigger the inevitable developments. Progressive ATE saga: Shareholders’ G.M., one day… after the hearing Late on Saturday night, the management of “Progressive ATE” informed its shareholders that the postponed General Meeting will take place on January 23. The date is not random, since one day earlier, on January 22, the interim measures filed by the main shareholder Chrysa Koutla (who appears to now control the company’s statutory minority) against the capital increase will be heard. It is obvious that the Board of Directors will request a new postponement from the Court in view of the “critical general meeting” the following day. The timetable betrays a strategy of continuous postponements on all fronts, while the Board knows it faces certain rejection. The situation is worsened by the emphatic absence of the Americans of LDA Capital Ltd from the entire process, despite the submission of a “Notice of claim” by the major shareholder, which remains unanswered. The contract with LDA Capital Ltd will be judged by the General Meeting of shareholders, while the invalidity of the extraordinary share capital increase of October 17 for their remuneration is expected to be decided judicially. All of this is quaint and interesting, while the case is being monitored by the Hellenic Capital Market Commission, as it had sent its officials to record the process of the postponed meeting. Mark Zuckerberg opened the nuclear energy floodgates Friday will be recorded in economic history as a critical milestone for Wall Street. Meta Platforms officially confirmed that the artificial intelligence revolution has an energy problem, and the solution can be nothing other than nuclear energy. Meta Platforms’ agreements with Oklo, TerraPower (of Bill Gates), and Vistra reveal the magnitude and scale of the problem. The data centers that power LLMs consume energy at levels that renewable sources cannot reliably cover. Nuclear energy offers the unique combination of high power, low emissions, and stable supply 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Wall Street reacted with an upward move of +1.2% in utility companies, but this probably does not reflect the full significance of the development. Utilities that for decades were “boring” dividend-yield stocks are transforming into swans of growth potential. Demand from AI data centers is creating a new cycle of infrastructure investments that could exceed $500 billion in the coming years. A +2.9% rally was also recorded in the Semiconductor ETF. Everything indicates that Wall Street “sees” an “energy bottleneck” that must be resolved soon. The expansion of Artificial Intelligence is not being restrained. Semiconductor companies such as Nvidia and AMD, as well as “semiconductor foundries,” that is, factories that manufacture chips on behalf of other companies such as TSMC, depend on the construction of new data centers. Data centers need energy. Oklo specializes in small reactors (Small Modular Reactors – SMRs). Meta has opened the nuclear energy floodgates. Amazon, Microsoft, and Google will follow with similar agreements. The race for dominance in Artificial Intelligence begins with who will secure reliable nuclear energy first. The restructuring of Commodity Indices will (temporarily?) pressure Silver An extremely interesting week begins in the precious metals market. The restructuring of Commodity Indices, after the stunning upward trajectory of Gold and Silver prices, will reveal their true dynamics. Goldman Sachs published a chart revealing a striking divergence in the precious metals market since 2022. While central banks accumulated approximately 3,600 tons of gold, Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (Gold ETFs) recorded net outflows of more than 1,000 tons. When Russian assets were frozen in 2022, mass gold purchases by central banks began, while the first Fed rate cut in 2024 marked a new phase. Emerging economies avoid transactions in dollars, trade in local currencies, and “lock in” exchange rates with gold. Geopolitical tensions fuel demand for “safe investment havens.” Silver, on the other hand, faces a different reality. Its hybrid nature (50% safe haven and 50% essential industrial metal) makes silver vulnerable to abrupt moves. Gold is driven by central bank purchases. Silver is affected by algorithmic trading as well as the green transition (which requires silver). The coming days will show the true dynamics. Explore related questions

The feature will allow users to specify specific assets, such as stocks and crypto, when posting cashtags like $BTC or $NVDA, according to a Sunday post by the company’s head of product, Nikita Bier. Tapping a Smart Cashtag will open an in-app page showing live prices, price changes, charts, and posts mentioning the asset. X said the tool is designed to reduce ambiguity around tickers and smart contracts, particularly in crypto markets where symbols can overlap. In some cases, assets will be identified by their underlying smart contract addresses. Bier said X plans to collect user feedback ahead of a public release targeted for next month. The company did not disclose whether the feature would include trading or monetisation components. The move reflects X’s broader effort to position the platform as a real-time source of financial information, as users increasingly discuss markets and trading activity on the platform. Musk has repeatedly said he wants to turn X into an “everything app,” including payments and financial services, and has previously floated the idea of supporting cryptocurrencies on the platform, while stopping short of confirming whether digital assets such as Dogecoin, his preferred meme coin, would be integrated into any future payments product. X’s former CEO, Linda Yaccarino, also announced in June that the platform would support in-app investing and trading. A month later, she resigned. Further announcements regarding an exact timeline of that feature’s rollout have not been provided. X Corp did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comment. Bier joined X around the same time as Yaccarino’s departure, and is an advisor to Solana and a venture partner at Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Title: Magnificent 7’s stock market dominance shows signs of cracking
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/11/magnificent-7-stock-market-dominance-cracking-nvidia-microsoft-apple-meta-alphabet-amazon-tesla/
Time Published: 2026-01-11T21:43:27Z
Full Content:
To beat the market in recent years, many investors applied a simple strategy: Load up on the biggest US technology stocks. It paid handsomely for a long time. But last year, it didn’t. For the first time since 2022, when the Federal Reserve started raising interest rates, the majority of the Magnificent 7 tech giants performed worse than the S&P 500 Index. While the Bloomberg Magnificent 7 Index rose 25% in 2025, compared with 16% for the S&P 500, that was only because of the enormous gains by Alphabet Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Many Wall Street pros see that dynamic continuing in 2026, as profit growth slows and questions about payoffs from heavy artificial intelligence spending rise. So far they’ve been right, with the Magnificent 7 index up just 0.5% and the S&P 500 climbing 1.8% to start the year. Suddenly stock picking within the group is crucial. “This isn’t a one-size-fits-all market,” said Jack Janasiewicz, lead portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, which has $1.4 trillion in assets. “If you’re just buying the group, the losers could offset the winners.” The three-year bull market has been led by the tech giants, with Nvidia, Alphabet, Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. alone accounting for more than a third of the S&P 500’s gains since the run began in October 2022. But enthusiasm for them is cooling as interest in the rest of the S&P 500 rises. With Big Tech’s earnings growth slowing, investors are no longer content with promises of AI riches — they want to start seeing a return. Profits for the Magnificent 7 are expected to climb about 18% in 2026, the slowest pace since 2022 and not much better than the 13% rise projected for the other 493 companies in the S&P 500, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. “We’re already seeing a broadening of earnings growth and we think that’s going to continue,” said David Lefkowitz, head of US equities at UBS Global Wealth Management. “Tech is not the only game in town.” One source of optimism is the group’s relatively subdued valuations. The Magnificent 7 index is priced at 29 times profits projected over the next 12 months, well below the 40s multiples earlier in the decade. The S&P 500 is trading at 22 times expected earnings, and the Nasdaq 100 Index is at 25 times. Here’s a look at expectations for the year ahead. The dominant AI chipmaker is under pressure from rising competition and concerns about the sustainability of spending by its biggest customers. The stock is up 1,165% since the end of 2022, but it has lost 11% since its Oct. 29 record. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has won data center orders from OpenAI and Oracle Corp., and Nvidia customers like Alphabet are increasingly deploying their own custom made processors. Still, its sales continue to race ahead as demand for chips outstrips supply. Wall Street is bullish, with 76 of the 82 analysts covering the chipmaker holding buy ratings. The average analyst price target implies a roughly 39% gain over the next 12 months, best among the group, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For Microsoft, 2025 was the second consecutive year it underperformed the S&P 500. One of the biggest AI spenders, it’s expected to invest nearly $100 billion in capital expenditures during its current fiscal year, which ends in June. That figure is projected to rise to $116 billion the following year, according to the average of analyst estimates. The data center buildout is fueling a resurgence in revenue growth in Microsoft’s cloud-computing business, but the company hasn’t had as much success in getting customers to pay for the AI services infused into its software products. Investors want to start seeing returns on those investments, according to Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “What you’re seeing is some people looking for a little bit more quality management in terms of that cash flow management and a better idea on what profitability really looks like when it comes to AI,” Mulberry said. Apple has been far less aggressive with its AI ambitions than the rest of the Magnificent 7. The stock was punished for it last year, falling almost 20% through the start of August. But then it caught on as an “anti-AI” play, soaring 34% through the end of the year as investors rewarded its lack of AI spending risk. At the same time, strong iPhone sales reassured investors that the company’s most important product remains in high demand. Accelerating growth will be the key for Apple shares this year. Its momentum has slowed recently, the stock closed higher on Friday, narrowly avoiding matching its longest losing streak since 1991. However, revenue is expected to expand 9% in fiscal 2026, which ends in September, the fastest pace since 2021. With the stock valued at 31 times estimated earnings, the second highest in the Magnificent 7 after Tesla, it will need the push to keep the rally going. A year ago, OpenAI was seen as leading the AI race and investors feared Alphabet would get left behind. Today, Google’s parent is a consensus favorite, with dominant positions across the AI landscape. Alphabet’s latest Gemini AI model received rave reviews, easing concerns about OpenAI. And its tensor processing unit chips are considered a potential significant driver of future revenue growth, which could eat into Nvidia’s commanding share of the AI semiconductor market. The stock rose more than 65% last year, the best performance in the Magnificent 7. But how much more can it run? The company is approaching $4 trillion in market value, and the shares trade at around 28 times estimated earnings, well above their five-year average of 20. The average analyst price target projects just a 3.9% gain this year. The e-commerce and cloud-computing giant was the weakest Magnificent 7 stock in 2025, its seventh straight year in that position. But Amazon has charged out of the gate in early 2026 and is leading the pack. Much of the optimism surrounding the company is based on Amazon Web Services, which posted its fastest growth in years in the company’s most recent results. Concerns that AWS was falling behind its rivals has pressured the stock, as has the company’s aggressive AI spending, which includes efforts to improve efficiency at its warehouses, in part by using robotics. Investors expect the efficiency push to start paying off before long, which could make this the year the stock goes from laggard to leader. “Automation in warehouses and more efficient shipping will be huge,” said Clayton Allison, portfolio manager at Prime Capital Financial, which owns Amazon shares. “It hasn’t gotten the love yet, but it reminds me of Alphabet last year, which was sort of left behind amid all the concerns about competition from OpenAI, then really took off.” Perhaps no stock in the group shows how investors have turned skeptical about lavish AI spending more than Meta. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has pushed expensive acquisitions and talent hires in pursuit of his AI ambitions, including a $14 billion investment in Scale AI in which Meta also hired the startup’s CEO Alexandr Wang to be its chief AI officer. That strategy was fine with shareholders — until it wasn’t. The stock tumbled in late October after Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditures forecast to $72 billion and projected “notably larger”spending in 2026. When the shares hit a record in August they were up 35% for the year, but they’ve since dropped 17%. Demonstrating how that spending is boosting profits will be critical for Meta in 2026. Tesla’s shares were the worst performers in the Magnificent 7 through the first half of 2025, but then soared more than 40% in the second half as Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk shifted focus from slumping electric vehicle sales to self-driving cars and robotics. The rally has Tesla’s valuation at almost 200 times estimated profits, making it the second most expensive stock in the S&P 500 behind takeover target Warner Bros. Discover Inc. After two years of stagnant revenue, Tesla is expected to start growing again in 2026. Revenue is projected to rise 12% this year and 18% next year, following an estimated 3% contraction in 2025, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, Wall Street is pessimistic about Tesla shares this year. The average analyst price target projects a 9.1% decline over the next 12 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show.

Title: The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a good choice if you want to buy a pair of earbuds almost exclusively for FPS games

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are a specialist product that excels in its particular niche. With clear, directional sound, they’re perfect for competitive shooters like Counter-Strike 2 and might even give you a slight advantage over your competition, but the very flat bass and lack of in-built microphone make them a poor fit for more general gaming in other genres. Comfortable with a wide range of fit options Clear, high fidelity spatial sound Fantastic included case Perfect for FPS games Lacks microphone Flat overall tuning Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Sony makes it very clear who the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are for. Developed in partnership with eSports team Fnatic, these wired in-ear monitor (IEM) style earbuds are squarely aimed at competitive first-person shooter (FPS) players or those with a generous budget aspiring to become one. Retailing for $149.99 / £129 / AU$209, they’re competing closely with some of the best gaming earbuds like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but don’t deliver the same all-round performance. If you’re looking for something that will elevate your experience in some of the best story games like God of War Ragnarok or Cyberpunk 2077, then these are certainly not it. The Sony Inzone E9 headphones are highly comfortable to wear and come with a superb carrying case, but the unapologetically flat sound is not going to help cutscenes or action sequences sound their best. The GameBuds, or even Sony’s own but more expensive Inzone Buds, are clearly better choices, but it's hard to fault the Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones for that, as that’s obviously not what they’re for. They really come into their own in a competitive first-person shooter (FPS) setting, pairing well with games like Counter-Strike 2, Valorant, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Here, the lack of bass prevents explosion and gunfire sound effects from overwhelming your senses, allowing you to focus on the impressive directional reproduction instead. The direction of key audio cues like footsteps is crystal clear and remarkably easy to discern, potentially giving you an advantage over those without such specialised audio gear. The noise isolation is exquisite, thanks in no small part to the excellent seal of the headphones in your ears. A plethora of ear tips is included in the box to make it easy to find the perfect fit, and the included USB-C audio box stores EQ profile settings to make for a hassle-free setup every time - ideal if you’re competing in tournaments and need to access the same settings on a new machine. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are priced at $149.99 / £129 / AU$209. This is a significant investment for a pair of wired gaming earbuds, with top wireless options like the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds costing not much more at $159.99 / £159.99 / AU$359. In addition to traditional gaming options, the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are also competing with the pricey in-ear monitor (IEM) earbuds favored by some FPS players. Here they come in at a very similar price to relatively affordable models from other big brands, such as the $149.99 / £129.99 Sennheiser IE 200. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are made specifically for gaming, however, setting them apart from most of the market and helping to justify the price. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones are available directly via Sony in the US and UK. They can also be found at a wide range of retailers, such as Best Buy in the US or Amazon in the UK. In Australia they’re in stock at both JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman. Price $149.99 / £129 / AU$209 Weight 0.16oz / 4.7g Compatibility PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, mobile Connection type Wired (3.5mm / USB-C with audio box) Battery life N/A Features USB-C audio box, spatial audio Software Inzone Hub (PC) The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones will have a familiar design if you’ve used a pair of IEM earbuds before. They’re lightweight, with rounded earbuds connected to a rigid section of cable that hooks around the top of your ears. Two colorways are available: black and white. Both are rather plain, but the abundance of Inzone logo branding printed on the earbuds does give them some character. Sony has definitely made some smart decisions when it comes to practicality, particularly with the length of the headphone’s cable. At 5.9ft / 1.8m, I found that it was more than long enough to comfortably reach my ears directly from my gaming PC’s 3.5mm headphone jack without the need for a cable extender. If you play on a console, you won’t have any issues hooking it up to your controller. I also appreciate the clear left / right marking that’s printed on each earbud, with the latter presented in a bright red that makes it easy to spot at a glance. A wealth of alternate ear tips come in the box, with a total of eight pairs to choose from. This includes standard silicone rubber ear tips and more foamy noise isolation earbud tips, both in four sizes (ranging from extra small to extra large). These are Sony’s widespread EP-EX10A and EP-NI1010 series tips - so replacements are easy to find if you need them later down the line. You get a USB-C audio box for use with PCs, too. This can be used to store settings from the compatible Inzone Hub software, like your desired equalizer pre-sets or custom profiles. It also lets you use a dedicated spatial sound mode, giving a good impression of sound in a 3D space, albeit at the cost of some overall fidelity. Between uses, you can store everything in the included carrying case that benefits from a surprisingly unique design. It’s divided into two compartments (one for the earbuds and the other for the audio box) joined together by a springy rubberized strip. The underside of the strip has little magnetic buttons, clipping down to keep everything in place. It might be a bit hard to imagine, but it works really well and is much more practical than the cheap pouches included with most earbuds these days. You also get a little Inzone-branded cable tidy, which is a neat bonus. The Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones have quite a flat sound profile out of the box, though this is presumably intentional. There’s not a lot of bass leading to quite an unexciting sound. Playing through some Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Assassin’s Creed Shadows on PS5, key story moments felt a tad muted with the backing music missing the punch needed to really drive the emotion home. You can address this somewhat by tweaking the EQ settings in the compatible Inzone Hub software, but there’s only so much that you can do to increase the bass on hardware that’s not designed for it. For story-focused games, the results were never punchier than what you get out of the box with the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds and far less effective than even cheap wired over-ear sets like the Corsair HS50. This lack of bass makes a lot more sense when you jump into a competitive shooter like Counter-Strike 2. Flashbangs and grenades are no longer overwhelming and don’t threaten to deafen you if you’re playing at higher volumes. Gunfire is more subdued, helping you stay focused in firefights. The sound is crystal clear too, with an impressive level of directionality that makes it easy to track enemy movements using key sounds like footsteps. It’s very impressive, especially given how well the effect holds up in more frantic situations. Diving into an explosive match of Nuketown in Black Ops 7, I was able to accurately hear where nearby opponents were moving, even against the constant barrage of explosions conjured by grenades and killstreaks. The detail is excellent, which is borderline essential in tense extraction shooters such as Escape From Tarkov, where being able to discern the subtle snapping of a twig can often mean the difference between life and death. If you’re currently one of the many people devoting every waking moment to Arc Raiders, I could see the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones being worth the asking price on this fact alone. Despite offering no active noise cancellation (ANC), the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones do a commendable job of blocking out background noise by virtue of the strong seal of their fit. No, it’s not as effective as the ANC of the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds, but it is good enough to drown out household sounds and conversations with the volume set at a decent level. Although very uncommon in the IEM market, I’m also a little disappointed that the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones don’t come with a small built-in microphone. It’s not a dealbreaker by any means, but it did mean that I had to reach for my Final VR2000 gaming earbuds when I wanted to chat with a friend while playing an Xbox Series X game. You’re a die-hard FPS fanIf you’re an FPS-head shopping for a pair of earbuds that you want to use exclusively to play the latest shooters, then the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones could be a very worthwhile investment. You want every possible advantageThe directionality offered by the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones is excellent and could mean the difference between a win and a loss in a competitive gaming setting. Pick up a pair if you want to ensure you have every possible advantage. You want a general use pairThe flat sound profile of the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones means that they’re not ideal for general use. At this price, there are loads of strong alternatives if you want something designed for a wider selection of genres with a microphone to help you chat with friends.

For more information, check out our full Sony Inzone Buds review I tested the Sony Inzone E9 in-ear gaming headphones over a period of roughly two and a half months. During that time, they were my primary gaming earbuds across all of my usual platforms. This included PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC. I tried the earbuds with a wide selection of games, ranging from story-based titles such as Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater to some of the most popular FPS games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Black Ops 7, Valorant, and Counter-Strike 2. Throughout my time with the earbuds, I compared their performance to my hands-on testing of a wide range of other gaming audio devices across the price spectrum.

Title: Larry Page, Jeff Bezos, and Sergey Brin are close to joining the $300 billion club as tech fortunes soar

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The $200 billion club could soon be old hat as tech bosses ride the AI wave to new levels of wealth. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin have seen their personal fortunes soar to over $250 billion each, putting all three men within striking distance of the $300 billion mark. For context, some of America's largest companies, including Costco, Netflix, Home Depot, Chevron, and Wells Fargo, have market capitalizations between $300 billion and $400 billion. Page and Brin were worth $281 billion and $261 billion, respectively, at Friday's close, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. They added $101 billion and $92 billion to each of their fortunes in 2025, making them the year's biggest wealth gainers after Elon Musk, and have gained another $12 billion and $11 billion each already this year. The key driver has been Alphabet shares soaring 65% last year, and rising a further 4.5% so far in 2026, as investors have grown more and more excited about the search-and-advertising titan's AI efforts. Bezos' wealth has climbed more modestly, from $239 billion at the start of 2025 to $268 billion at Friday's close. That reflects a roughly 5% rise in Amazon's stock price last year, and another 6% rise this year, as investors wager the e-commerce giant's massive AI investments will start to pay off. Only Musk is richer than the trio; the Tesla and SpaceX CEO was worth $639 billion at Friday's close. He saw a $165 billion wealth jump last year, thanks to Tesla stock gaining 11% and SpaceX's valuation leaping from $350 billion to $800 billion. He's added an unmatched $19 billion to his name so far in 2026. Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Musk in wealth last September, when his fortune ballooned by a record $89 billion in a single day to $388 billion. Since then, investors have cooled on Oracle's AI prospects, pushing down Ellison's net worth to $251 billion at Friday's close. In total, there are 18 "centibillionaires," or individuals with at least a $100 billion net worth. As a group, they grew $708 billion richer last year, lifting their combined wealth to $3.6 trillion — a figure greater than Microsoft's market value. Within that elite group, there are seven people worth upward of $200 billion: Musk, Page, Bezos, Brin, Ellison, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury giant LVMH. All of them except Arnault own huge stakes in some of the world's leading AI companies, which have soared in value as investors rush to buy their shares on news of buzzy partnerships, massive contracts, and sky-high growth forecasts. Advocates, including investors Ross Gerber and Kevin O'Leary, have told Business Insider that AI will supercharge productivity and boost corporate profits. But skeptics, like Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, have warned that tech giants are overinvesting in microchips, data centers, and other infrastructure in their scramble to win the AI race, creating a bubble that will burst disastrously down the line.

Daily Tech News 11 January 2026 Top Story Meta has signed long-term contracts with three suppliers for a total of 6GW of nuclear power for its datacenters. (Tech Crunch) Two of the partners are startups developing small modular reactors; the third, Vistra, is a major operator of traditional large non-modular reactors. Meanwhile researchers in China have managed to break the Greenwald limit on the number of alt accounts a single journalist can have agreeing with his posts before he screws up. (The Independent) Wait, I'm told in this context it's an empirical limit on sustained plasma densities in Tokamak-style fusion reactors. With this breakthrough, fusion power is now only nineteen years and twelve months away. Tech News It's a water heater! It's a Bitcoin miner! It's both! (Tom's Hardware) Given that the main cost of mining Bitcoin is the energy it takes - and disposing of the waste heat somehow - why not use it for, say, heating water? The Superheat H1 does exactly that. And if the price of Bitcoin collapses, it still heats your water. Can light move faster than the speed of light? (Science Daily) Some theories of loop quantum gravity predict small fluctuations of the speed of light in a vacuum. New experiments put an upper bound on how big those fluctuations could be, ruling out some of these theories. I call them theories rather than mere speculation because they actually made sufficiently robust predictions to be ruled out in the first place. A theory can be wrong, but it's not a theory if you can't test it. Can AI do your job? (MSN) If you're a computer programmer, or you otherwise work solely with words, possibly yes. If you do literally anything else, the best AI models currently succeed at 2.5% of human tasks. AMD will be launching socketed versions of the Ryzen 400 processor series later this year. (WCCFTech) Too late, really. Zen 6 will be out this year, and if you want integrated graphics it looks like Intel's Panther Lake is faster - though only if you are willing to go with a system with soldered memory. If you need conventional DIMM or SODIMM memory, you get models cut down from 12 GPU cores to just 4, which isn't beating anything. So maybe not too late, but underwhelming. And if you want dedicated graphics, you might need to buy soon. (Tom's Hardware) Nvidia GPUs are hardest hit so far, with reports of stock on all models running low in Germany and Japan. Since that was the first direct warning we had of the memory crunch (though in retrospect the signs were there months earlier) I bought myself a 9060 XT while they were in stock and on sale. Which as of time of writing, they still are. Asus and Gigabyte are putting 64MB of ROM on their new AM5 motherboards. (Tom's Hardware) Earlier AM4 motherboards often had as little as 16MB of ROM for the BIOS, which became a problem as AMD kept releasing new chips for the platform - Socket AM4 first appeared in 2016, even before Zen 1, and the most recent new processor for that socket, the 5500X3D, was launched in June last year. There were simply too many different models of compatible processors to fit all the necessary code into 16MB. With AM5 confirmed to support the upcoming Zen 6 chips later this year, and strongly hinted to support Zen 7 due in 2028, it will end up being an even longer-lived platform with more CPUs, so motherboard makers are fixing the problem before it arises. Amazon is using AI to sell your products on their store without you having to lift a finger. (Modern Retail) Also, without Amazon ever asking permission to do so. Also also, without Amazon bothering to sync the data properly from your online store so that they don't, for example, still list long-discontinued products for sale. Store owners are not happy. NBC News is intensifying a collapse of trust online. (NBC News) No, they didn't have a brief moment of self-awareness. They're blaming three years of AI for thirty years of their own failings. Musical Interlude In 2008, a young Suzuka Nakamoto was part of a short-lived trio called Karen Girl's - yes, with the misplaced apostrophe - and performed Over the Future, the opening theme for the anime series Zettai Karen Children. You may know her better as the lead singer for Babymetal. Thanks Mikeski for pointing me to the Babymetal cover of Over the Future. (I checked three different versions of the first clip. The full-length animated one is available in every single country in the world, except, for some reason, Belarus. If anyone is reading this from Belarus, sorry.) Disclaimer: Give me chocolate...

Speaking of data centers and water... during a county zoning meeting this past summer, the county executives were attempting to slide a center into an area of farmland being rezoned. It was revealed that the center would consume millions of gallons of water a month. More than half the current residential consumption. And up to 50% of that water evaporated during the cooling process for the processors at the datacenter. The rest wasn't recycled due to contamination and would have to stored in evaporation ponds. Half of the local, residential water would be consumed by this thing. And there was no plan to increase the water capacity. I'll note that this was only part of the county. The entire county wouldn't end up dry.... just this one, little, undeveloped area nobody seemed to notice. Except for everyone who lived there.

I believe the US moved some military assets into the region about the same time we went after that "dark fleet" oil tanker in the N. Atlantic. So... earlier this week. We already struck ISIS in Syria for killing 2 National Guard (Iowa, I think) and their American interpreter, so assets are in the region. I just think the administration doesn't quite know what to do in Iran. It's not as simple as it would seem. Wheels within wheels....

UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’s Grok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multiyear period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle

Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.
