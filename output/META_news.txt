The new iPhones will be the first to be released since President Donald Trump returned to the White House and unleashed a barrage of tariffs, in what his administration says is an attempt to bring overseas manufacturing back to the US — a crusade that has thrust Apple CEO Tim Cook into the hot seat. If Apple follows the same naming scheme since the product's 2007 debut, the new models will be called the iPhone 17. But the Cupertino, California, company recently deviated from tradition with its naming formula for the iPhone operating system. When the next version of its iOS system was previewed at its developers conference in June, Apple revealed the free update will be called iOS 26 in reference to the upcoming year — a marketing technique that automakers have embraced for decades. Regardless, these new iPhones are still expected to be made in Apple's manufacturing hubs in China and India, much to the Trump administration's consternation. Both Trump and US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick have repeatedly insisted that iPhones be made in the US instead of overseas. It's an unrealistic demand that analysts say would take years to pull off and would result in a doubling, or even a tripling, of the iPhone's current average price of about $1,000. Cook tried to placate Trump by initially pledging that Apple would invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years and then upped the ante last month by adding another $100 billion to the commitment. He also gifted Trump a statue featuring a 24-karat gold base. That kind of diplomacy has helped insulate Apple from Trump's most severe tariffs. However, the iPhones being brought into the US still face duties of about 25 per cent, stoking speculation that the company will reveal its first across-the-board price increase in five years in an effort to preserve its hefty profit margins. Since 2020, Apple has charged $800 for its basic iPhone and $1,200 for its top offering, but analysts now believe the company may raise prices by $50 to $100 on some of the new models. If Apple does announce price increases, it will come just weeks after Google held steady on prices for its new Pixel smartphones. Whatever Apple ends up charging for the next iPhone, the new line-up isn't expected to be much different from last year's model — the first to be designed for a wide range of new artificial intelligence features. While the iPhone 16 has proven to be popular, the models didn't sell quite as well as analysts had anticipated because Apple failed to deliver all the AI-fueled improvements it had promised, including a smarter and more versatile Siri assistant. The Siri improvements have been pushed back until next year. That has lowered the expectations for this year's line-up, which will likely include the usual improvements in camera quality and battery life on top of a slightly redesigned appearance. The most significant new twist could be the introduction of an ultra-thin iPhone dubbed “Air” — a moniker Apple already slaps on like its sleekest iPads and Mac computers. The relatively minor updates to recent iPhone models are raising questions about Apple's ability to innovate in the fast-moving era of AI, said Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson. “Apple is reaching a tipping point, and I expect 2026 and 2027 to be pivotal years." Apple's AI follies, combined with its exposure in Trump's trade war, have weighed on the company's stock, while the market values of Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet have been surging. Although Apple's stock price is still down by 4 per cent so far this year, the shares have been bouncing back in recent months amid signs it won't be as hard hit by the tariffs as once feared, and a highly anticipated court ruling cleared the way for the company to continue receiving USD 20 billion annually to lock in Google's search engine as the default option on iPhones.

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Jeremy here again, filling in for Andrew, who is at Fortune Brainstorm Tech in Deer Valley, Utah. The conference kicked off yesterday, and man, I’ve got serious FOMO.Some highlights so far: But the big news in tech today, aside from what’s happening at Fortune Brainstorm Tech, of course, is anticipation around Apple’s big hardware reveal later today. iPhone fans—and Apple investors—have great expectations. Will Apple live up to them? Bea Nolan has a rundown below of what we might see unveiled. One thing analysts are cautioning we probably won’t see: a lot of those native AI features Apple has been promising iPhone users for more than a year now.Always leave ‘em wanting more may be good showbiz advice, but it might not do Apple’s share price any favors. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple is set to unveil its latest iPhone in an “awe-dropping” event later today. The company is hosting its annual product launch in Cupertino where it's slated to launch major hardware refreshes across its lineup and debut the brand new iPhone 17 family. The company is also expected to launch updates to the iPad Pro, Vision Pro headset, Apple TV, and HomePod mini and reveal the iPhone 17 Air, set to be the thinnest iPhone to date. Apple has been navigating a complex political environment, and some analysts expect the tech giant to raise prices on the Pro models as the company deals with a challenging tariff environment. Analysts have also cautioned against expecting a major AI announcement during the event. “Apple has already shared that a major Siri and Apple Intelligence revamp will only happen in 2026 and, timing-wise, it’s unlikely a major strategic investment in an AI firm would coincide with Apple’s keynote next week,” Forrester’s Thomas Husson noted. Instead, he said Apple is more likely to spotlight its new A19 Pro chip, which features a more powerful Neural Engine for on-device AI tasks like conversational models, advanced photo editing, and personalized suggestions. A fresh AI partnership with Google’s Gemini could also surface, building on last year’s tie-up with ChatGPT. The show kicks off at 10 a.m. PT. —Beatrice Nolan OpenAI is scrambling to salvage its corporate restructuring after facing unexpected opposition, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal report. The company is even considering the "nuclear option" of leaving California entirely, though a spokesperson denied any plans to relocate. The stakes couldn't be higher: about $19 billion in funding—nearly half of what OpenAI raised in the past year—depends on investors getting traditional equity in a new for-profit structure. Currently, OpenAI issues "profit participation units" instead of traditional stock, but investors want real equity. If the restructuring collapses, those investors can pull their money—a potentially catastrophic blow for a company planning to burn through $115 billion by 2029. OpenAI now faces a coalition of dozens of nonprofits, labor unions, and philanthropies opposing the move, plus a legal challenge from Elon Musk. Meta has been lobbying to block the deal too, the Journal reports. Both California and Delaware attorneys general are investigating the restructuring, with concerns about recent suicides linked to ChatGPT interactions complicating approval. Regulators are questioning whether OpenAI has abandoned its original public benefit mission for revenue. The AGs could sue or demand hefty settlements as conditions for approval. OpenAI executives didn't anticipate this backlash, according to the Journal, and are now scrambling to save the deal, hiring advisers with ties to Governor Newsom while pledging $50 million to community organizations.—Jeremy Kahn Two former and two current Meta employees have submitted documents to Congress alleging that Meta curtailed research into children’s safety, according to a report from The Washington Post. The employees allege that after Frances Haugen’s 2021 leaks, Meta quietly limited how staff could study sensitive issues like youth well-being, race, and harassment. They allege Meta’s lawyers advised researchers to avoid collecting data on minors and even urged them to run sensitive studies under attorney-client privilege. One researcher says he was ordered to delete an interview in which a teen described his 10-year-old brother being sexually propositioned in Horizon Worlds. Meta told news outlets the deletion was required under privacy law, citing rules that ban collecting information from children under 13 without verified parental consent. Meta has denied the rest of the claims, saying the allegations were “stitched together. The company also said it had approved nearly 180 Reality Labs-related studies on social issues, including youth safety and well-being, since 2022. A Senate subcommittee is set to review the whistleblowers’ claims this week. —Beatrice Nolan The judge overseeing Anthropic’s proposed settlement with authors has blasted the agreement as “nowhere close to complete.” Judge William Alsup said at a Monday hearing that he felt “misled” by the settlement proposal and had “an uneasy feeling about hangers on with all this money on the table.” He cited concerns about class lawyers striking a deal behind the scenes that will later be forced “down the throat of authors.” The motion to approve the deal was denied, and a post-hearing order stated that approval is postponed until more information is provided. Attorneys will now have to return with a revised settlement proposal. As part of this, the judge directed the parties to create a form requiring all copyright owners to opt in to the settlement; if any owner opts out, that work will be excluded. Judge Alsup set a September 15 deadline for submitting a final list of works, which currently stands at just under 500,000. The $1.5 billion settlement had already been touted as one of the largest copyright deals in U.S. history, and experts say it could establish a benchmark for similar cases. —Beatrice Nolan Anthropic endorses California’s AI safety bill. It’s the first major AI company to back the bill. Trump’s tech dinner triggers a MAGA backlash. Tech bosses spike tensions in MAGA land. SpaceX to acquire EchoStar Spectrum in $17B deal. The deal will allow EchoStar to resolve a regulatory probe. A former WhatsApp security chief has sued Meta, alleging ignored privacy risks. WhatsApp called the claims false and tied to poor performance. Google says the open web is already in “rapid decline.”The statement starkly contrasts Google’s recent claims about the health of web search. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Massive AI salaries and RTO are fueling a real estate boom in San Francisco: 'It's going to rain money'
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-money-rto-real-estate-boom-san-francisco-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-09T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
The AI boom has lit a fuse under San Francisco's housing market, with prices and rents inflamed by a tech workforce increasingly returning to the office, and as the AI talent wars push salaries to dizzying highs. Tech workers are flocking to the Bay Area to work at OpenAI, Anthropic, and Nvidia after the region was dealt a massive blow during the COVID-19 pandemic. Real estate agents say RTO is fueling the resurgence, with AI being particularly synonymous with in-person work and hardcore culture. What's more, tech workers, especially those working in AI, are commanding massive salaries, including multimillion-dollar compensation packages. The salary needed to afford a home in the San Jose metro area — which encompasses Silicon Valley and the headquarters for Meta, Google, and Nvidia — crossed the $400,000 threshold for the first time in April 2024, said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist — "an inconceivable amount of money unless you work in AI, and those salaries are probably more common." This makes it the most expensive metro area in the US. Home prices in the San Jose metro area are up 3% year-over-year, according to Redfin. While big AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic aren't public, employees can tap equity during stock sales on the private market. One former OpenAI employee, who requested anonymity to speak about personal matters, told Business Insider they purchased a home in San Francisco during the company's last tender and knew of at least four others who did the same. "It's definitely the popular move, and people are talking about it again," they said. The luxury housing market in San Francisco is also setting records. More homes sold above $20 million in the city last year than ever before, according to Sotheby's 2025 Mid-Year Luxury Outlook report, which its international realty chief marketing officer, A. Bradley Nelson, attributed largely to AI's rise. Another Bay Area county, San Mateo County, nestled between San Francisco and Silicon Valley, is seeing record prices for single-family homes — $2.6 million on average this year, according to MLS data. This boom is fueled by both the rise of AI and the strength of the stock market, said Raziel Ungar, a San Mateo County real estate agent who has worked with Big Tech buyers working at Oracle, Google, and Apple. "There's been so much wealth that's been created in the last few years, in particular in the Valley, that it's pushed our prices higher," Ungar said. San Francisco real estate agent Ruth Krishnan has worked with several OpenAI employees who have cashed out during tender offers to make down payments on homes, she said. Krishnan likened the current "level of frenzy" to the period before Facebook's IPO in 2012, with homebuying anticipation fueling rapid transactions and swaths of competitive offers on each property. With news of OpenAI's latest $10.3 billion secondary share sale, "it's going to rain money in SF," she said. AI workers are quickly adapting to newfound wealth. A second former OpenAI employee said that when they first moved to San Francisco, they lived in a group house and paid roughly $1,200 a month in rent. Now, former colleagues frequent Michelin-starred restaurants and wear luxury goods. "They have massive bag collections, they have upgraded their houses, and everything," the second former employee said. "It feels more like a normal tech company or even kind of like finance in some ways." The rental market is also rocketing. Rents across the San Francisco metro area are up about 5% since last year — double the pace of national growth, a Zillow representative told Business Insider. Apartment hunters are handing out "tenant résumés" at packed showings, making offers site unseen, offering several months of rent in advance, or coming in at thousands of dollars over the asking price, The San Francisco Standard previously reported. In terms of specific San Francisco neighborhoods, Mission Bay is central to AI activity, Krishnan said, while the Hayes Valley neighborhood has been dubbed "Cerebral Valley." Other desirable neighborhoods for those in the field include South Beach, Dogpatch, Potrero Hill, the Mission, Noe Valley, and Bernal Heights, Krishnan said. Despite their eye-popping salaries, the average AI homebuyer tends to be more pragmatic, real estate agents said. They're "data-driven and decisive," said San Francisco real estate agent Danielle Lazier, adding that many clients "model payments, taxes, and micro-market evaluations with large language models before touring." While the single-family home market is "on fire" and condos are "perking up," Lazier said a full pre-COVID recovery hasn't yet been attained. Krishnan agreed that buyers in AI aren't "going crazy," adding that a typical purchase ranges from $2 million to $4 million — still a relatively staggering sum. The AI wave is nascent, and while many of her clients are young, they're aware of past tech busts, she said. "They're being very cautious about what if this doesn't last forever," she said. "They've heard of people who thought that they had all this money that then disappeared, and it seems to be top of mind for them, actually. So they're not overspending. They're cautiously spending."

Title: Snap breaks into 'startup squads' as ad revenue stalls | TechCrunch

In a new annual company letter, CEO Evan Spiegel just announced the company is restructuring around small “startup squads” of 10 to 15 people to better compete against larger competitors. The move comes as the 5,000-person company faces mounting pressure. Advertising revenue growth flatlined at 4% in the second quarter, and North American daily active users declined 2% to 98 million, a troubling sign in Snap’s most important market. Spiegel does highlight one bright spot: Snapchat+ subscriptions now generate over $700 million in annual recurring revenue from more than 15 million paying subscribers, making direct revenue “one of Snap’s fastest-growing opportunities.” Snap is also doubling down on Specs, building its own AR glasses that Spiegel envisions will replace smartphones entirely. He calls them a “a once-in-a-generation transformation towards human-centered computing.” (Meta and Google see the same future, partnering with Ray-Ban and Warby Parker, respectively.) Spiegel acknowledges the current stock price “reflects doubt” but writes that there’s “startup-style return potential” at Snap’s roughly $12 billion valuation. Left unsaid: that number is down 90% from September 2021, when Snap’s market cap topped $116 billion during the height of social media mania.

UPDATED 13:26 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 by Chad Wilson Artificial intelligence is no longer just a software story — it is the foundation for AI factories, where chips, data pipelines and networks work together as production systems for digital outcomes. This emerging model is redefining how performance is measured and how value is created across industries. These AI factories combine custom semiconductors, low-latency fabrics and massive data instrumentation into real-time feedback loops that generate competitive advantage. They are reshaping business models as chipmakers secure long-term custom contracts and enterprises harness telemetry to transform traditional experiences into living, digital ecosystems. The economics of compute now rival the economics of manufacturing. This framing sets the stage for the latest episode of theCUBE Pod with theCUBE Research’s John Furrier (pictured, left) and Dave Vellante (right), who explored how Broadcom Inc., Nvidia Corp. and IBM Corp. are navigating this shift. Their conversation ranged from real-time analytics at the U.S. Open to the rise of custom silicon deals and the broader race to scale AI-powered infrastructure. “This is going to be a continuing boom for the Broadcoms and the Nvidias because they’re the arms dealers and the supply chain,” Furrier said. “Nvidia is going after the enterprise. Broadcom is taking more of an open approach.” The concept of AI factories came up repeatedly as a lens for interpreting today’s market. The phrase underscores that compute resources are not abstract tools, but production lines for data-driven outcomes. Broadcom and Nvidia illustrate two ends of this spectrum. Nvidia pursues a vertically integrated model where hardware, software and systems are tightly coupled. Broadcom takes a modular approach, pursuing multi-year custom silicon deals while pairing semiconductors with software to balance cycles, according to Vellante. “They’ve turned the US open into an AI data factory,” he said about theCUBE’s recent attendance at the sporting event. “They don’t use that marketing. That’s Dell and Nvidia, but it really is a data factory. They’ve got over a hundred years of matched data. They got all the history on where the balls lands. The note I have here is four and a half million data points per match and it’s unbelievable.” The US Open became a showcase of AI factory economics, with IBM’s watsonx processing millions of data points in near real time across 17 courts. Broadcom’s $16 billion quarter underscored the same theme: Long-term chip deals and capital-intensive ecosystems are redefining vendor strategies, customer experiences and enterprise value, Furrier explained. “The OpenAI deal represents what I call the white box model for the large-scale clusters, which is simply there will be a market that will rise up to feed the demand for essentially custom chips that will feed into what could be a clone of Nvidia, meaning purpose-built systems,” he said. “OpenAI had a huge incentive in cash to vertically integrate their own. We’ve been having this debate, heterogeneous versus homogenous.” Beyond the headlines on earnings and chip design, the broader conversation centered on how ecosystems evolve. AI factories are not just hyperscaler phenomena. Their influence touches enterprises through partnerships, data integration strategies and the application of agentic workflows. That’s why upcoming conversations in the AI factories series are significant: They extend the debate from chips and cloud clusters into enterprise readiness, interoperability and governance, Vellante emphasized. “Broadcom … almost $16 billion in revenue, up 23% in the quarter. That’s just the quarter, operating income at six billion, almost 37% of revenue,” he said in reference to their place in the industry. “Their free cash flow is $7 billion, 45% of revenue — that’s higher than Microsoft; that’s higher than Nvidia. The thing about Broadcom … they have these long duration, high value, multi-year, multi-billion-dollar custom chip deals.” Nvidia’s integrated approach, framed by “Jensen’s Law,” highlights doubling performance annually, though its enterprise impact remains in question. Both Nvidia and Broadcom are benefiting from AI demand, while Salesforce Inc., IBM and others push agentic, data-driven growth. Yet Wall Street often overlooks these strategies, underscoring why financial and technical roadmaps remain inseparable. “I would say that Nvidia’s on the learning curve and Nvidia’s ahead of everybody to the extent that you need the latest greatest,” Vellante explained. “They are furthest along on the learning curve, which means they have the most innovation and the lowest cost, not the lowest price of course, but that’s their moat. I see it continuing for quite some time unless and until those laws become non-immutable.” Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta Platforms Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI David Sacks, White House AI and crypto czar Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Jim Cramer, American TV personality and author Arvind Krishna, chairman and CEO of IBM Bruno Aziza, group VP, data, BI and AI at IBM Aaron Rakers, managing director and technology analyst at Wells Fargo Pat Gelsinger, former CEO of Intel Paul Maritz, chairman at Pivotal and former CEO of VMware Jeff Bezos, chairman of Amazon Michael Dell, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies Marc Benioff, chair and CEO of Salesforce George Gilbert, principal analyst at theCUBE Research Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase Sarbjeet Johal, founder and CEO of Stackpane Jonathan Cantor, SVP and deputy chief privacy officer of Truist Lina Khan, former chair of the FTC Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft Janet Reno, former U.S. attorney general Jack Ma, Chinese business magnate and investor Donald Trump, 45th and 47th president of the United States of America Here’s the full episode of this week’s theCUBE Pod: Don’t miss out on the latest episodes of “theCUBE Pod.” Join us by subscribing to our RSS feed.

UPDATED 12:08 EDT / SEPTEMBER 08 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom Inc. and Nvidia Corp. are locked in a zero-sum battle for artificial intelligence data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. Nvidia has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the internet. In this Breaking Analysis, we examine the different strategies of Broadcom and Nvidia and explain why the success of one doesn’t necessarily mean dilution to the others’ prospects. Nvidia’s strategy is straightforward in concept but extraordinarily difficult to replicate. The company builds a full-stack platform that starts with graphics processing units and extends across the system. Jensen Huang has repeatedly emphasized that the unit of competition is no longer the chip, but the system or what Nvidia coined as the AI factory. Nvidia has positioned itself as the indispensable supplier for anyone looking to stand up these factories. At the core of Nvidia’s stack are GPUs such as Hopper and Blackwell, paired with NVLink/NVSwitch interconnects to form tightly coupled compute domains. These “pods” scale to 72 GPUs, creating high-bandwidth, low-latency islands optimized for extreme parallel processing workloads such as AI training. Nvidia extends these pods outward using InfiniBand, a proprietary network technology it captured from its Mellanox acquisition. In addition, Nvidia leverages its Spectrum-X Ethernet, a purpose-built Ethernet fabric designed to handle AI traffic deterministically. On top of the hardware sits its CUDA software stack and hundreds of libraries that represent the software glue that makes these systems programmable and highly tuned. Nvidia’s software moat is deep, with tens of thousands of developers locked into its ecosystem and wide supporting a virtually infinite number of use cases. In addition, the company offers systems and services such as DGX, NIMS inference microservices and Omniverse for simulation and digital twins, further solidifying its position as a platform, not just a chip supplier. The cadence of innovation is relentless. Each year, Nvidia launches new architectures that deliver better performance per watt and higher utilization of the cluster. This annual rhythm turns capital spending into a recurring monetization cycle. The result, when power is a constraint and systems are underutilized, is that customers spend more, generate more tokens per watt, and reduce unit cost at scale. Broadcom’s approach is significantly different from that of Nvidia. Chief Executive Hock Tan and Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, are not chasing GPUs or building giant AI systems. Instead, Broadcom’s playbook is to identify durable franchises – markets with a decade or more of runway – establish technology leadership, and run them with intense operating discipline. Some investors have shied away from Broadcom citing it as a “commodity player.” In our view, this narrative is misguided and lacks an understanding of the engineering investments required to deliver the products Broadcom produces, including in its wireless portfolio. In semiconductors, Broadcom has staked its claim in connectivity. Its Tomahawk and Jericho families dominate merchant Ethernet switching. It has also secured custom silicon design wins with Google, Meta and likely ByteDance, embedding Broadcom deep into the hyperscale AI buildout. These are multibillion-dollar, long-duration deals that are highly strategic. The company just announced it closed another $10 billion custom chip deal, widely known to be with OpenAI, which, like the hyperscalers, is designing its own chips to reduce its reliance on Nvidia. On the last earnings call, Tan had what appeared to be an inadvertent and ironic “tell” saying the following: Today’s AI rack scales up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabit per second bandwidth using proprietary NVLink. On the other hand, earlier this year, we have launched Tomahawk 5 with OpenAI — with open Ethernet, sorry, which can scale up 512 compute nodes for customers using XPUs. This slip of the tongue came right after he announced the most recent $10 billion custom chip deal, leading many observers, including us, to conclude that OpenAI was clearly embedded (in a good way) in Tan’s head space. Charlie Kawwas’ mantra is “OSP.” It stands for open, scalable, power-efficient and frames Broadcom’s philosophy. The company bets that open standards such as Ethernet and PCIe will ultimately win out over proprietary approaches such as InfiniBand and NVLink. History suggests this is a good bet, which is why Nvidia has also embraced Ethernet. In software, Broadcom has reshaped VMware around VMware Cloud Foundation, announcing VCF 9.0 claiming the integration of all those disparate VMware software modules was achieved with thousands of engineers creating the bundle. Broadcom’s strategy to force customers into higher-value contracts, though controversial, has driven operating margins above 70% and gross margins over 90%, substantially better than other software-as-a-service gross margins. Moreover, VMware has become the most robust on-premises alternative to public cloud and represents the most mature private cloud offering on the market, in our view. The quirk of Broadcom’s VMware strategy is that alternatives such as Hyper-V, Nutanix, Red Hat and others have gained momentum, where previously they were shut out as virtualization plays. Broadcom doesn’t want the customers unwilling to pay up for the full VCF stack, but alternative players that don’t have nearly the profitability profile of Broadcom are happy to take the business. The graphic below shows Enterprise Technology Research’s Net Score methodology for the virtualization market. The vertical axis (Net Score) represents the net percentage of customers spending more on each platform and the horizontal axis shows penetration into the data set. The data would lead one to believe that VMware is struggling, noting its precipitous drop from January 2023. But the methodology doesn’t capture amount of spend. As such, it misses the fact that Broadcom’s strategy has been to focus its efforts more narrowly on those high value customers willing to spend on the whole VCF bundle to lower total cost of ownership. This is a classic Broadcom move. It only competes in markets where it can dominate. In the case of VMware, it’s not the number of logos that matters, rather its the number of customers that willing to absorb price increases and buy the full bundle. Contrary to many misguided narratives, Broadcom invests heavily in engineering and surrounds its platform with critical technologies that drive clear return on investment. This is why (for example) even Nvidia buys networking technologies from Broadcom. The bottom line is that Broadcom doesn’t need to win in GPUs head-to-head with Nvidia to thrive. Instead, it supplies the glue — SerDes, NICs, optics and switches — that make large AI systems possible. In Kawwas’ words, Broadcom doesn’t make GPUs, it makes the stuff that makes XPUs and HBMs work. In addition, it has secured multibillion-dollar, long-duration contracts to build custom AI chips for some of the top companies in the world, including Google, Meta, ByteDance and now OpenAI. A major flashpoint between the two companies is the question of scale. On Broadcom’s most recent earnings call, Tan depositioned Nvidia’s NVLink 72 as “scaling up a mere 72 GPUs at 28.8 terabits per second,” contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet fabrics that can connect 512 nodes using Tomahawk 5. At face value, this makes Nvidia’s approach sound limited. But the comparison is misleading in our view. The way we interpret Nvidia’s use of the “scale up, out, across” terminology is as follows: Broadcom, in Tan’s remark, appears to have used “scale up” more loosely to mean “supporting larger clusters than 72 GPUs.” But technically, connecting 512 compute nodes with Ethernet is a scale-out fabric, not scale-up. In particular, scale-up is generally thought of as making a single logical system bigger by tightly coupling components. Think symmetric multiprocessing in a single box. In our view, Tan was depositioning NVLink’s rack-level island (72 GPUs) as small, contrasting it with Broadcom’s Ethernet-based ability to connect hundreds of nodes. In doing so, he takes liberty with the terminology, calling Ethernet’s cluster expansion “scale up,” when in fact in classic parlance it’s scale-out. In contrast, Nvidia’s 72 GPUs refers to a tightly coupled NVLink domain where high-bandwidth memory pools are shared across GPUs, enabling highly efficient parallel operations. Broadcom’s 512 nodes really refers to the scale-out capability of Ethernet fabrics. It is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The two approaches solve different problems. NVLink maximizes performance within a rack, while Ethernet extends clusters across racks and rows. The tradeoff is that NVLink delivers peak performance per GPU, Ethernet delivers estate-level scalability and economics. In practice, operators use both – NVLink for high-performance compute islands, Ethernet for stitching those islands together. The financial models of Nvidia and Broadcom underscore their different strategies. On the surface, both companies post extraordinary results, but the way they get there is different. Nvidia today is running at a revenue pace of roughly $187 billion annually, up an impressive 56% year-over-year. Despite moderating from the triple-digit growth rates of prior quarters, this remains one of the fastest growth profiles of any mega-cap. Margins are equally impressive: 73% gross, 65% operating and 33% operating cash flow. With a market capitalization north of $4 trillion and a 22x run rate revenue multiple, Nvidia is being valued as a once-in-a-generation growth company, not a traditional semiconductor provider. In our view, this reflects investor conviction that Nvidia’s full-stack AI factory strategy has years of runway left, with annual cadence upgrades, CUDA software lock-in and hyperscaler demand elasticity sustaining momentum. And an economic value proposition that is compelling when power is the limiting factor and utilization/efficiency improvements can be achieved with rapid tech refreshes. In its recent earnings call, Nvidia stressed the ramp of Blackwell, with NVLink 72 deployments showing 10x efficiency gains on reasoning workloads compared with Hopper. Management highlighted that inference is now a meaningful revenue stream, alongside training. In terms of ROI, elasticity (Jevons paradox) is allowing Nvidia to cut price per token while still growing revenue. Broadcom, by contrast, is delivering exceptional results with a different playbook. The company is operating at an annualized revenue run rate of about $64 billion, growing a solid but more measured 22% year-over-year. This past quarter its non-AI semiconductor offerings were a headwind, but they’re expected to grow sequentially. Broadcom’s gross margin of 67% is lower than Nvidia’s, but Broadcom shines in cash generation, with 45% operating cash flow margin – a remarkable figure given the scale of the business. Operating margin sits at 37%, well below Nvidia’s, but consistent with Broadcom’s blend of semiconductors and infrastructure software. Its valuation, at roughly $1.6 trillion market cap and a 25x revenue multiple, is notable. Investors are waking up to Broadcom, not for its hypergrowth, but for its durability, discipline and strategic positioning as the connective tissue for AI infrastructure, the go-to firm for custom AI chips and the value creator of its VMware asset. Broadcom’s recent earnings highlighted Tomahawk 5’s ability to scale clusters well beyond the NVLink pod size. We note the caveats to Tan’s statements, as cited earlier. Tan reiterated that VMware Cloud Foundation adoption is ahead of schedule, with software margins approaching 70%. AI silicon revenue run-rate hit ~$16 billion, anchored by custom hyperscaler wins and an exciting $10 billion deal widely reported to be with OpenAI. In our opinion, these financial metrics underscore Nvidia as a hypergrowth platform company trading at a premium for its velocity, while Broadcom is a durable compounder valued for its consistency, cash flows and long-term franchises. Both models are exceptional, both companies are fundamental to the AI movement, but they reflect entirely different philosophies of how to capture value in the AI era. We believe the implications of these strategies are meaningful in the sense that: In our opinion, the market should stop framing Broadcom and Nvidia as rivals in a zero-sum contest. Moreover, the idea that Broadcom is a commodity play, as posited by some pundits, is absurd in our view. Nvidia and Broadcom are playing different games, both of which are essential to the AI era. Nvidia builds the compute engines and software platforms that drive new workloads. Broadcom ensures those engines can scale, interconnect and operate profitably over a decade-long horizon. Our research suggests that as AI moves from cloud to enterprise to real-world systems, both Nvidia and Broadcom will expand their moats in very different, but highly synergistic ways. The real battle is not between them, but between this new architecture and the legacy compute stack it is replacing.

ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map.

In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, or HSG, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/07/job-growth-sputters-rate-cuts-and-recession-incoming/
Time Published: 2025-09-07T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Deutsche Bank analysts have been watching Amazon Prime, it seems. Specifically, the “breakout” show of the summer, “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” In the AI sphere, analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan wrote, it was the summer AI “turned ugly,” with several emerging themes that will set the course for the final quarter of the year. Paramount among them: The rising fear over whether AI has driven Big Tech stocks into the kind of frothy territory that precedes a sharp drop. The AI news cycle of the summer captured themes including the challenge of starting a career, the importance of technology in the China/U.S. trade war, and mounting anxiety about the impact of the technology. But in terms of finance and investing, Deutsche Bank sees markets “on edge” and hoping for a soft landing amid bubble fears. In part, it blames tech CEOs for egging on the market with overpromises, leading to inflated hopes and dreams, many spurred on by tech leaders’ overpromises. It also sees a major impact from the venture capital space, boosting startups’ valuations, and from the lawyers who are very busy filing lawsuits for all kinds of AI players. It’s ugly out there. But the market is actually “more sober” in many ways than the situation from the late 1990s, the German bank argues. Still, Wall Street is not Main Street, and Deutsche Bank notes troubling math about the data centers sprouting up on the outskirts of your town. Specifically, the bank flags a back-of-the-envelope analysis from hedge fund Praetorian Capital that suggests hyperscalers’ massive data center investments could be setting up the market for negative returns, echoing past cycles of “capital destruction.” AI has captured the market’s imagination, with Cox and Abrudan noting, “it’s clear there is a lot of hype.” Web searches for AI are 10 times as high as they ever were for crypto, the bank said, citing Google Trends data, while it also finds that S&P 500 companies mentioned “AI” over 3,300 times in their earnings calls this past quarter. Stock valuations overall have soared alongside the “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, which collectively comprise a third of the S&P 500’s market cap. (The most magnificent: Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.) Yet Deutsche Bank points out that today’s top tech players have healthier balance sheets and more resilient business models than the high flyers of the dotcom era. By most ratios, the bank said, valuations “still look more sober than those for hot stocks at the height of the dot-com bubble,” when the Nasdaq more than tripled in less than 18 months to March 2000, then lost 75% of its value by late 2002. By price-to-earnings ratio, Alphabet and Meta are in the mid-20x range, while Amazon and Microsoft trade in the mid-30x range. By comparison, Cisco surpassed 200x during the dotcom bubble, and even Microsoft reached 80x. Nvidia is “only” 50x, Deutsche Bank noted. Despite the relative restraint in share prices, AI’s real risk may be lurking away from its stock-market valuations, in the economics of its infrastructure. Deutsche Bank cites a blog post by Praetorian Capital “that has been doing the rounds.” The post in “Kuppy’s Korner,” named for the fund’s CEO Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, estimates that hyperscalers’ total data-center spending for 2025 could hit $400 billion, and the bank notes that is roughly the size of the GDP of Malaysia or Egypt. The problem, according to the hedge fund, is that the data centers will depreciate by roughly $40 billion per year, while they currently generate no more than $20 billion of annual revenue. How is that supposed to work? “Now, remember, revenue today is running at $15 to $20 billion,” the blog post says, explaining that revenue needs to grow at least tenfold just to cover the depreciation. Even assuming future margins rise to 25%, the blog post estimates that the sector would require a stunning $160 billion in annual revenue from the AI powered by those data centers just to break even on depreciation—and nearly $480 billion to deliver a modest 20% return on invested capital. For context, even giants like Netflix and Microsoft Office 365 at their peaks brought in less than a fraction of that figure. Even at that level, “you’d need $480 billion of AI revenue to hit your target return … $480 billion is a LOT of revenue for guys like me who don’t even pay a monthly fee today for the product.” Going from $20 billion to $480 billion could take a long time, if ever, is the implication, and sometime before the big AI platforms reach those levels, their earnings, and presumably their shares, could take a hit. Deutsche Bank itself isn’t as pessimistic. The bank notes that the data-center buildout is producing a greatly reduced cost for each use of an AI model, as startups are reaching “meaningful scale in cloud consumption.” Also, consumer AI such as ChatGPT and Gemini is growing fast, with OpenAI saying in August that ChatGPT had over 700 million weekly users, plus 5 million paying business users, up from 3 million three months earlier. The cost to query an AI model (subsidized by the venture capital sector, to be sure) has fallen by around 99.7% in the two years since the launch of ChatGPT and is still headed downward. Praetorian Capital draws two historical parallels to the current situation: the dotcom era’s fiber buildout, which led to the bankruptcy of Global Crossing, and the more recent capital bust of shale oil. In each case, the underlying technology is real and transformative—but overzealous spending with little regard for returns could leave investors holding the bag if progress stalls. The “arms race” mentality now gripping the hyperscalers’ massive capex buildout mirrors the capital intensity of those past crises, and as Praetorian notes, “even the MAG7 will not be immune” if shareholder patience runs out. Per Kuppy’s Korner, “the megacap tech names are forced to lever up to keep buying chips, after having outrun their own cash flows; or they give up on the arms race, writing off the past few years of capex … Like many things in finance, it’s all pretty obvious where this will end up, it’s the timing that’s the hard part.” This cycle, Deutsche Bank argues, is being sustained by robust earnings and more conservative valuations than the dotcom era, but “periodic corrections are welcome, releasing some steam from the system and guarding against complacency.” If revenue growth fails to keep up with depreciation and replacement needs, investors may force a harsh reckoning—one characterized not by spectacular innovation but by a slow realization of negative returns. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person in the world and he's all set to get richer. Musk, whose current net worth is close to $378 billion, was the first person to have a net worth of over $400 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Now, a proposed new pay package could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. The company's shares were trading 8% lower year-to-date as of Sept. 5, 2025. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk was vocal in his support for Trump, Forbes reported, joining him on the campaign trail and becoming Trump's second largest donor by putting $118 million into America PAC, which Musk created. He also served on Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency till May this year. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionnaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. Tesla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

Title: Google's $3.5B Fine Signals End of Big Tech's Free Pass

Google's regulatory reckoning has finally arrivedâand it's expensive. The tech giant is facing a historic $3.5 billion fine from European authorities for breaking antitrust laws, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. With courts finding Google liable for maintaining monopoly power and global antitrust enforcement fines hitting $6.7 billion in 2024âmore than double 2023's totalâwe're witnessing a fundamental shift in how regulators approach Big Tech monopolies. PRO TIP: This isn't just about one company getting fined. The coordinated global crackdown on Google represents the end of Big Tech's "move fast and break things" era. For consumers and competitors, this could mean real change in how we access information and digital services. Let's break down the scale of Google's legal troubles. In April 2025, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google liable for 'willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power' through its integration of advertising tools. The court found that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing open-web digital advertising markets for over 15 years, manipulating ad-tech auctions and stifling competition. Here's where it gets interesting: Google's dominance isn't just about search. The company commands more than 90% of Android app downloads and processes over 24 billion updates per week through its Play Store. That level of control means Google decides which developers succeed, what users can access, and how much everyone pays. The EU's approach has been particularly aggressive. The Digital Markets Act designated Google as a 'gatekeeper', imposing strict data governance rules. The EU can fine companies up to 10% of their global annual revenue for DMA violations, which translates to a potential $35 billion maximum penalty based on Google's 2024 earnings. The genius of Google's strategyâand what makes it so problematicâlies in how its 2008 DoubleClick acquisition created the infrastructure for today's violations. By purchasing the dominant ad-serving platform, Google didn't just buy a competitor; it acquired the tools to control every step of the digital advertising process. This acquisition enabled Google to implement the DMA-violating practices and Play Store restrictions that courts are now finding illegalâturning what appeared to be routine business expansion into the foundation of systematic market manipulation. Google's advertising empire is where the real money flowsâand where regulators are focusing their firepower. These ad tech tools account for roughly $95 billion in annual revenue, approximately 15% of Alphabet's total revenue. But here's the kicker: Google's advertising technologies generate about $30 billion annually and form the backbone of internet economics. The DOJ's case reveals how Google systematically eliminated competition. The DOJ has demanded a structural divestiture of Google's ad tech business, including the sale of DFP and AdX. Internal evidence shows Google takes a 20 percent commission on transactions carried out through its ad exchange, while Google's DFP ad server has enjoyed a market share of 84 to 90 per cent over the last ten years. The court's findings are damning. Google engaged in unlawful conduct to maintain monopolies by limiting publisher ad server access and requiring publishers who wanted access to AdX to use DFP. This isn't just market dominanceâit's market manipulation. Bottom line: Google essentially became the auctioneer, the auction house, and the payment processor all at once. When competitors tried to offer better deals or more innovative solutions, Google made it increasingly difficult for them to participate. Internal documents revealed that Google deliberately designed its systems to favor its own servicesâand when publishers tried to resist these changes, Google knew they had no choice but to comply or lose access to essential advertising revenue. The European Commission isn't playing games. Abuse of dominance decisions by The European Commission accounted for over 75% of the overall global fine volume in 2024. Beyond Google, the EC set its third ever highest fine with its EUR1.84 billion fine on Apple and fined Meta EUR792.7 million for abusing its dominance. Google's European troubles run deep. The EU's top court upheld a record-breaking â¬2.4 billion fine for anti-competitive promotion of its Shopping service. Google was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favour its own comparison shopping service, presenting search results with attractive visual information while relegating competitors to basic links. The pattern is clear: Google has accumulated penalty exposure of more than 8 billion euros by the EU for various antitrust violations. This isn't just about one caseâit's systematic regulatory pushback against Google's market practices. What makes Europe's approach revolutionary is its shift from traditional antitrust thinking. Unlike previous cases that focused on consumer harm through higher prices, the EU's Digital Markets Act targets "gatekeeper behavior" that stifles innovation and choice. In the Shopping case, the court found that Google's conduct was discriminatory and did not fall within the scope of competition on the merits. Translation: Google wasn't winning because it was betterâit was winning by rigging the game, and that's enough for enforcement action regardless of immediate consumer impact. The stakes couldn't be higher. The remedies trial will decide whether Google must divest its ad tech assets or adopt behavioral changes, with the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust showdown with Google entering its final phase this fall. Google isn't going down without a fight. The company has opposed the breakup, warning of 'seismic disruptions' to its ad tech ecosystem and proposes behavioral adjustments, such as ending UPR and sharing bid data with competitors. But UBS warned in 2025 that a forced breakup of Google's ad-tech business could trigger a 30% stock plunge. The ripple effects extend far beyond Google. A breakup could create opportunities for rivals like Meta, TikTok, and independent ad tech firms, while the case mirrors EU antitrust actions against Google and could influence ongoing U.S. cases targeting Amazon and Meta. Here's what makes Google's predicament particularly challenging: the company has already tried to make concessions, proposing alternative billing options and even considering partial divestitures to appease European regulators. But publishers rejected the proposal, viewing these measures as insufficient half-steps that fail to address the fundamental structural problems. With the Biden and Trump administrations both supporting this case, there's rare bipartisan consensus that meaningful action is requiredâmaking it nearly impossible for Google to wait out the regulatory storm. Bottom line: We're witnessing the end of Big Tech's regulatory free pass. The Biden and Trump administrations both have supported this case, showing rare bipartisan cooperation in prosecuting tech monopolies. The current batch of significant antitrust cases working through the courts could eventually provide the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to reshape antitrust jurisprudence for the digital era. Google's $3.5 billion fine isn't just a penaltyâit's a signal that the era of unchecked tech dominance is ending. With global antitrust enforcement reaching unprecedented levels and regulators worldwide coordinating their efforts, the question isn't whether Google will face more consequences, but how dramatically the entire tech landscape will reshape in response. What makes this regulatory moment truly unprecedented is the coordinated international response. European, American, and other regulators are no longer working in isolationâthey're sharing intelligence, coordinating enforcement strategies, and learning from each other's legal frameworks. This makes it impossible for tech giants to play regulatory arbitrage or simply absorb fines as a cost of doing business. When the EU develops new approaches like the Digital Markets Act's "gatekeeper" framework, U.S. courts take notice, creating a global convergence toward tougher tech oversight. The implications cascade beyond Google to the entire interconnected web of Big Tech dominance. Apple faces its own antitrust challenges, Meta confronts divestiture demands around Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon faces scrutiny over its treatment of third-party sellers. Unlike previous enforcement efforts that tackled companies in isolation, regulators now understand how these platforms reinforce each other's market power and are addressing the ecosystem systematically. For users, developers, and competitors who've been squeezed by Google's dominance, this regulatory reckoning might finally level the playing field. If these enforcement actions deliver on their promise, we could see genuine choice in search engines, real competition in digital advertising, and innovation from companies that no longer face impossible barriers to entry. The real test will be whether these legal victories translate into tangible changes in how we experience and interact with digital platforms. The era of "move fast and break things" is over.

Title: Using The Blog Module vs Divi 5’s Loop Builder

The #1 WordPress Theme & Visual Page Builder Harness the Power of Divi With Any Theme The Best Theme for Bloggers and Online Publications The Ultimate Email Opt-In Plugin for WordPress The Best Way To Promote Social Sharing Forgot Your Username or Password? Posted on September 5, 2025 by Christopher Morris Leave a Comment The Blog Module is Divi’s built-in feed generator that works out of the box. It gives you a fast way to list posts with toggles for titles, images, excerpts, and metadata. Divi 5’s new Loop Builder takes a different approach. You design the item with any modules, then feed dynamic content into it. Both tools display looped content, yet each shines in different scenarios. Knowing when to use which saves time and prevents frustration. Let’s compare the two. Subscribe To Our Youtube Channel This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to the concept of a Loop Builder: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The Blog Module is built for recognizable blog patterns. It assumes common elements and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how blog posts work in WordPress. Every post shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as blog content. These shared characteristics include: The Blog Module was designed with traditional posts in mind. Titles tell you what the post covers. Featured images add visual draw. Excerpts preview the content. Metadata says who wrote it and when. Divi’s Blog Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in querying tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the author but keep the date, show the image, or skip the excerpt. Small decisions yield quick results. The Blog Module can display normal posts and properly register Custom Post Types. The Blog Module works fine when the CPT mirrors standard post fields. It becomes limiting when you need true custom data. So, a Team Member CPT works when things are kept simple. The Blog Module handles this situation with ease. Limitations appear with any fields that default posts don’t share. Social links, certifications, or years of experience won’t appear in the Blog Module because it was built for the standard fields found on default WordPress blog posts. The module has no toggle for those custom fields. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module packs elements inside a fixed structure in a fixed order. You can’t reorder the title and image unless you use custom CSS. You can manage the layout of each blog card via flexbox or block, but child items (the cards) don’t have Sizing settings for child flexbox control (like shrink to fit or grow to fill). ﻿ The Blog Module is excellent and fast to use for standard card layouts. If you get a bit of a creative bug, you might find yourself looking for something more custom. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying dynamic content. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, Loop Builder allows you to construct your content display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Blog Module. With the Blog Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. Loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop,” it repeats itself for each matching result. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, and Button modules. You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct token. Divi’s UI makes this pretty simple. The Image points to the featured image. The Heading points to the title. The Button links to the post URL. This modular approach gives you structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can also add two text blocks for two custom fields. This way, you can build the card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a couple of quick scenarios. We’ll keep the pattern and swap the fields. Let’s use the card design from our previous example and see how it can be adapted using custom post types and custom fields. First, build a custom Loop for standard blog posts. Use the stand Posts ‘post type’ with the standard fields for title, category, publish date, and feature image. Map each to the respective module in your design. These use standard post fields but are arranged in a unique layout. We can do something similar for some simple real estate listings. Using the same card layout, we can populate content from our custom post type with the heading assigned to the property title, Text Modules assigned to bedrooms, bathrooms, and property description, and a Button bound to the property listing URL. The end result looks like our blog card, but uses the Loop Builder’s ability to assign content from Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. All this talk of CPTs, how do you make those? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here. Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset also create fields that Loop Builder can read. Use what fits your budget, experience, and stack. A note for real estate websites: You’ll want to use a dedicated plugin that pulls listings from an IDX into WordPress as a CPT. That way, you have fresh data and minimal manual work (no one wants to manually enter properties every morning). Flexbox pairs naturally with the Loop Builder. You can use it at two levels for a clean, responsive structure without custom CSS. First, style the outer loop container. Select the loop parent container. Turn on Flex layout. Set direction to Row. Enable Wrap if you want multiple flex-rows. Set Gap to control spacing between items. Then, adjust the sizing of the child container where your loop sits using the Sizing options. You can create a responsive and attractive layout for your looped elements between the container Flex controls and the child Flex controls. Second, style the inner card layout. Select the root container inside the loop item (the Column or Group Module, for instance). In Layout options, set Flex direction to Row if you want some elements side by side. Set the width of the image module to take up about half the space in the container. Let the text area (in this case, a Group container with various modules inside) fill the rest (Grow to Fill in Group Module Sizing options). You can arrange the various containers or modules however you want. You aren’t locked into a preconfigured layout. Here we put the Title in the left Group and set the right group to Flex Column. This gives us a subtle yet unique change of layout. There really is no shortage of possibilities. ﻿﻿ This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Blog Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Blog Module when content follows standard post patterns. Title, featured image, excerpt, and basic meta are its sweet spot. Basic news sites, company updates, and simple portfolios qualify. Visitors expect a conventional layout, and you may want a reliable solution with minimal setup. With the Blog Module, you can ship a working feed in minutes. Fewer moving parts also mean fewer chances to break things (or get confused). Non-technical users who might still be lost on the concept of a “loop” will still heavily rely on the Blog Module. It’s a great tool and should absolutely be used. Use Loop Builder when you need fields that posts don’t have, or when your card structure doesn’t match a stock pattern. Ecommerce, real estate, and education are typical industries that tend to need more customization. Each needs details that live in custom fields. When you are working with more content or more types of content, layouts tend to need more flexibility. Use Loop Builder when content relationships get complex. You may need to mix post types in one view and show content from repeaters. Divi’s Blog Module is still the fastest way to ship a standard feed. The Loop Builder unlocks custom cards, custom fields, and repeaters. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design that you have in mind, while the Blog Module has some limitations there. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the job. Divi 5 is coming together and is more powerful (and stable) than ever.

Title: What’s up with… Ciena, Telecom Italia, Starlink in India
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ciena-telecom-italia-starlink-in-india-53773/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:47:16Z
Full Content:
Sep 5, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ciena’s on a roll; Telecom Italia’s new largest shareholder is Italy’s state-owned postal service; Elon Musk’s Starlink is prepping for its satellite broadband launch in India; and more! As we reported on Thursday, Ciena is benefitting from the rising investments needed in network capacity as cloud, video and, in particular, AI-related data volumes increase, as it reported a 29.4% year-on-year increase in revenues to $1.22bn for its fiscal third quarter that ended on 2 August. In the company’s earnings presentation, the optical, routing and automation software technology vendor noted that in addition to that stellar growth continuing into its fiscal fourth quarter, it is also set to extend into its fiscal year 2026, which runs (roughly) November 2025 to the end of October 2026. The company expects full year revenues for fiscal 2026 to be 17% higher than in fiscal 2025 (which ends in late October), way higher than the 10% growth that financial analysts had been expecting. That growth is being driven by increasing investments from the hyperscalers, big tech giants/datacentre operators, such as Meta, and major US telcos, such as Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. Fiscal 2025 full year revenues are set to come in at around $4.7bn, so that puts Ciena’s expectation for its fiscal 2026 sales at $5.5bn. No wonder the vendor’s share price jumped by an incredible 23.3% on Thursday to end the day at $116.92. Italy’s state-owned postal service Poste Italiane has been given unconditional approval by the country’s antitrust authority, the AGCM (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), to acquire a 15% stake in national telco Telecom Italia (TIM) from French media giant Vivendi. The deal was first announced in late March. According to Poste Italiane, “the AGCM resolved to approve the transaction unconditionally and, therefore, not to initiate an investigation, as it does not significantly impede effective competition in the affected markets and does not result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant position”. As a result of the purchase, Poste Italiane is now Telecom Italia’s largest single shareholder, with a total stake of 24.81%. In August, Telecom Italia reported revenues of €6.6bn, up 2.7%, for the first six months of the year, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 5% to €1.7bn. Starlink, Elon Musk’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation that is having a major impact on the global broadband services and direct-to-cell (D2C) communications sectors, has received a provisional spectrum licence from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) so it can trial its satellite broadband services in the country. The New India Express reports that Starlink is setting up ground stations at 10 locations across India as well as a main operations hub in Mumbai. The operator now has to prove it can comply with India’s security rules during a number of tests and trials: If it is successful it will be awarded a full licence, though the DoT noted that full licence pricing and terms are still to be finalised. The expectation, though, is that Starlink will proceed without any major issues and soon become an influential player in India’s broadband services sector, not least because it has already struck partnerships with India’s two largest telcos, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. US long-distance operator Lumen Technologies is to use Palantir Technologies’ Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help transform its business. “Lumen is transforming from traditional telecom into a next-generation technology infrastructure company leveraging its physical fiber network, digitally powered platform and connected ecosystem,” noted Palantir in this announcement. “To meet customers’ evolving multicloud, AI-ready needs, Lumen is collaborating with Palantir across its operations, finance and technology functions to unlock new value. Palantir’s Foundry and AIP aim to streamline workflows, accelerate decision-making, and simplify complex legacy operations – from customer service and compliance reporting to the decommissioning of legacy telecom infrastructure and migration of products into modernised ecosystems. By surfacing actionable insights and enabling AI-assisted decision-making, the software is driving faster execution and improved operational efficiency, empowering Lumen to transform its network and services with speed,” added Palantir. Dave Ward, chief technology and product officer of Lumen Technologies, stated: “As Lumen powers the backbone of the AI economy, we’re determined to make our own operations intelligent and efficient, just like the networks we deliver to our customers. Working with Palantir allows us to harness AI to accelerate our modernisation efforts and deliver the network and services our customers need in the AI era.” – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 10, 2025 Sep 10, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Marvell: MRVL Stock To $140?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/marvell-mrvl-stock-to-140/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T12:35:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been one of the tech sectors more puzzling stories this year. Despite delivering record second quarter results and showing signs of building a niche for itself in AI infrastructure, the stock has slumped 43% year-to-date - including a 15% slide in the last week - after management issued a cautious outlook for its data center business. Shares now trade at $64 apiece. The sell-off stems from lumpy orders for Marvell’s custom AI accelerators, but such quarterly volatility is fairly common in this market. Delays in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) next-generation AI chips amid design changes could be pushing back demand for Marvell’s silicon, while Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS which relies on Marvell for its Trainium AI chips has been losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Overall, these issues appear more like timing-related volatility than structural problems. Marvell’s long-term opportunity in AI looks compelling, given not just its custom accelerators, but also its optical connectivity chips. Could this underappreciated AI player be set up for a sharp rebound? We outline a case that could see the stock more than double to almost $140 per share from current levels. Separately, see important current market context – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Marvell's Long Growth Runway In AI Marvell’s push into the AI market began with its high-speed interconnect solutions for data centers. These optical and electrical interconnects are essential for moving the enormous volumes of data generated by AI and machine learning workloads. Since these workloads rely on massive parallel processing and ultra-fast data transfer, they place heavy demands on existing infrastructure, creating a need for the advanced connectivity technologies that Marvell provides. The bigger growth driver has been application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for AI. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are customized for the requirements of individual customers such as hyperscalers, delivering better cost efficiency, lower power consumption, and superior performance. This could play to Marvell’s advantage in the long-run. Big tech is in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure such as GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, investors will eventually begin to prioritize returns on AI investments and companies could become more judicious with spending. Big companies could seek alternatives to Nvidia, and Marvell’s specialized models could be a top choice for hyperscalers. Also see: What’s happening with SMCI stock? There are signs that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may begin to level off, with the industry’s focus shifting toward inference - the application of trained models to new data in real time and at massive scale. Inference is lighter per task but occurs continuously across millions of users and applications. This transition plays directly into Marvell’s strengths, as it opens the door for specialized, power-efficient solutions beyond the high-end GPUs that dominate training. The market could potentially shift from large-scale general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized ones, potentially helping more niche players like Marvell who offer tailored products that optimize costs and performance for specific applications. The 2x Math Coming back to the stock's potential, the math works like this. Marvell trades at about 40x trailing earnings and about 23x estimated FY'26 adjusted earnings. This is well below peers such as AMD and Nvidia. AMD trades at about 40x forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 38x. This indicates that Marvell’s multiple is not stretched. Revenue Growth: Marvell Technology has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 10.9% over the last 3 years, but this does not capture the big AI surge the company is witnessing. Over the most recent quarter, net revenue came in at a record $2.0 billion, up 58% compared to the same period last year. Marvell revenue stood at about $5.77 billion in FY'25 and the metric is likely to grow by about 41% to $8.14 billion per consensus estimates. Looking ahead, if revenues expand at an average rate of 30% each year over FY'27 and FY'28, driven by AI demand, Marvell's top line could scale to about $13.7 billion by FY'28. Adjusted margins: Coming to margins, Non-GAAP net income was $585.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Adjusted net margins stood at 28% over the first six months of the year. As scale improves and fixed costs are absorbed, margins are expected to gradually move higher. For perspective, Nvidia now posts margins of over 50%. If Marvell’s adjusted net margins rise to about 30%, this would translate into adjusted net income of over $4.1 billion, roughly 3x FY'25 numbers. Earnings multiple: Now if income rises so much, the trailing multiple, which stands at about 40x would fall to a third of its value or about 13x, right? Probably not. As Marvell scales up its business profitably, investors might continue to assign a high multiple of about 30x, about 25% below current levels. This would translate into a market cap of roughly $120 billion, or a little over 2x from current levels. See MRVL Valuation Ratios What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three - as long as MRVL sustains its revenue expansion trajectory and steadily improves margins, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17%

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. American Bitcoin, a mining company tied to US President Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., wrapped up its first day of trading on the Nasdaq with sharp swings but still managed to finish 16.75% higher at just over $8. After-hours trading pushed the stock up another 6% to $8.50, reports confirmed. Trading opened with a rush. The newly rebranded company, formed through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP), jumped as high as $13.21 from Gryphon’s previous close of $6.90, a 90% surge. That early momentum collapsed quickly, sending the stock down to $6.70 in the afternoon before it recovered part of the loss. Nasdaq halted trading five times due to extreme volatility. Despite the erratic moves, Bloomberg estimated Eric Trump’s 7.5% stake at roughly $548 million by the end of the session. His fortune is now tied directly to how American Bitcoin performs in the market. According to Eric Trump, the company will not only mine Bitcoin but also buy it when conditions make more sense. He described the approach as switching “to whichever is better at the time.” The company’s existing treasury already holds 2,443 BTC, making it the 25th-largest stash among public companies. With Bitcoin trading above $112,000, that holding is worth about $275 million. Eric Trump emphasized that the business will aim to maximize shareholder value by balancing mining output and market purchases: “We’re going to harness daily mining to the fullest, but we can also go out and purchase Bitcoin to support the treasury,” the presidential son said. The launch has stirred questions about whether American Bitcoin benefits from President Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Eric Trump dismissed criticism that his family is profiting directly from political ties, saying his father has “nothing to do with this business.” The American Bitcoin debut came just days after another Trump-linked venture. Tokens for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a separate crypto project involving President Trump and his sons, were listed on exchanges earlier in the week. WLFI’s performance has so far been weak, dropping 30% from its debut price and losing another 7% in the last 24 hours to about 21 cents, based on CoinMarketCap data. A company tied to the Trumps owns nearly a quarter of all WLFI tokens, estimated at $4.6 billion in value. While WLFI struggles to gain traction, American Bitcoin’s opening has given the Trump family another high-profile position in the crypto sector. Whether the stock can maintain its momentum after a chaotic debut remains uncertain, but Eric Trump called the launch “an unbelievable day” and insisted “the floodgates are just starting to open.” Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

'Making Money' host Charles Payne discusses what's causing the market to pull back. If you were investing in the late 1990s, you’ll remember the euphoria of the dot-com boom. Anything with a ".com" at the end of its name could raise millions in capital and see its stock price double or triple overnight. Investors believed the internet would change everything – which, to be fair, it eventually did. But between 2000 and 2002, that dream turned into a nightmare when the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Today, with artificial intelligence leading headlines and fueling investor enthusiasm, many people are wondering if we are about to experience another dot-com bust? AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. ( / iStock) The Parallels to the Late ’90s There are some undeniable similarities between the two periods. Back then, internet companies with little more than a business plan and a website were valued at astronomical levels. Today, AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. The narrative is powerful, and capital is rushing in. Recently, Palantir which is a fan favorite stock right now, traded with a PE of 522! TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA Another similarity is market concentration. In 1999, Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and AOL were the poster children of the boom. Fast-forward to today, and the so-called "Magnificent 7" – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – make up more than 30% of the entire S&P 500. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is supposed to be a diversified index of America’s top companies. But if just a handful of stocks are driving most of the returns, that creates real risks if those companies stumble. The market capitalization of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks is almost 40% of the entire S&P 500 Index. The Differences That Matter While the echoes of the dot-com era are loud, the differences are even louder. UBS managing director and senior portfolio manager Jason Katz weighs in on artificial intelligence in the U.S. markets and cryptocurrencies' performance in the stock market. First, valuations are stretched but not nearly as absurd as 1999. Back then, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 was over 25 – an eye-popping figure for the time. Many internet stocks had no earnings at all, making traditional valuation metrics meaningless. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE Today, the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio hovers around 21. That’s elevated compared to the long-term average of 15-16, but nowhere near dot-com territory. And crucially, the tech giants dominating today’s index are highly profitable businesses generating enormous cash flow. The only area where we see these dot-com patterns popping up are in AI stocks. Slap the two letters AI next to a stock and it’s a feeding frenzy for investors. Second, the companies leading the charge aren’t speculative startups with unproven business models. Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are trillion-dollar companies with fortress balance sheets and decades of consistent profitability. Nvidia – the crown jewel of the AI trade – sells real products with extraordinary demand. Unlike Pets.com, Webvan.com and eToys (remember them?), these firms have sustainable revenue streams and durable competitive advantages. Is AI the New Dot-Com? There’s no doubt that AI feels frothy. Just as investors in the late 1990s believed every business would be transformed by the internet, many now believe AI will reshape every corner of the economy. Some of this optimism is justified. Essex Investment Management CO-CEO Nancy Prial reveals the factors that are driving market breadth improvement on 'Making Money.' GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The internet did change the way we live our lives today. AI has the potential to boost productivity, reduce costs and create entirely new industries. But in the short term, markets almost always overestimate the speed of adoption and AI companies start up so fast that many are bound to fail. That’s where the risk lies: not in whether AI will change the world, but in how quickly investors think it will happen. History tells us that transformative technologies often go through hype cycles. We thought by now, people wouldn’t still be writing checks but still 50% of Americans wrote at least one check over the past 12 months. There will be winners, but there will also be plenty of losers along the way. Why This Isn’t 2000 Despite the hype, I don’t believe we’re headed for a repeat of the dot-com crash. Here’s why: Fitz-Gerald Group Chief Investment Officer Keith Fitz-Gerald argues Tesla is an A.I. stock and explains why Palantir can hit $100 per share by the end of the year on 'Varney & Co.'

But a wholesale collapse of the market like we saw from 2000 to 2002 is unlikely. The better comparison might be the railroad boom of the 1800s. Railroads transformed the economy, and many companies failed along the way. But the infrastructure they created powered America’s growth for more than a century. AI may follow the same path – messy in the early years, but ultimately world-changing.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
