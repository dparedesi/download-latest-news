Latest Topics The Nightly Topics In a record breaking year for US stocks, two stats are ringing alarm bells. For the first time in more than 20 years, the major US index — the S&P 500 is experiencing what market watchers call “bad breadth”. The run in US stocks has been remarkable. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters. Get the first look at the digital newspaper, curated daily stories and breaking headlines delivered to your inbox. Barring a big sell-off before the end of the year, the S&P 500 is on track to show a more than 25 per cent return, if dividends are included. The S&P 500 achieved a similar return last year. A 50 per cent gain over two years is extraordinary. The long-term average annual return for the S&P 500 is around 10 per cent. These gains have been driven largely by the so-called “Magnificent Seven”: Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Nvidia. All these companies have benefited from the seemingly limitless promise of artificial intelligence. Trump’s election also put a rocket up stocks, with investors feeling that the Donald’s low regulation, low tax promise will juice earnings. In market parlance, the index is being boosted by what is called a momentum trade – otherwise known as FOMO. American retail investors haven’t been as bullish on US stocks in 40 years. Sixty per cent expect stocks to rise over the next 12 months. You can see why they are are, with the median holding of a stock portfolio rocketing to $250,000 compared to 150,000 just 18 months ago. But while retail investors are FOMOing into equities, those actually running the companies appear to be getting out. The number of corporate executives selling down their shares has reached the highest level in 20 years. According to Bloomberg data, there are six times as many executives selling their company stock as there are those buying it. And another key metric suggests that smart money is rolling out of their holdings, while the overall market is melting higher. For the last nine days, more stocks in the index have fallen than risen. The last time that the market saw consecutive declines of that nature was back in 2001 in the days after 9/11 ,in 1998, when the market eventually crashed 22 per cent, and in 1996 when the market dropped 11 per cent. It makes the US market a dangerous place to be when there are more declining stocks than advancing, particularly given how much the S&P 500 has bounced on weak fundamentals since Trump. Investment bank Macquarie thinks that the US market is “overly bullish” and is advising clients start looking at defensive stocks. “We see surprises turning negative in January,” MacBank wrote to clients. The big market gains may still hold if the US consumer continues to spend. So far they haven’t disappointed, with American shoppers increasing their spend by 3 per cent over the three months to October. Add in the prospect of rate cuts, and rising wages and disposable income may rise further. But there are Trump and Elon sized clouds on the horizon that may change the consumer spending picture. If Trump adds more tariffs, that will make goods more expensive, not only reducing sales but potentially forcing the Federal Reserve to raise rates to contain inflation. At the same time, the Department of Government Efficiency is looking to rip through the public sector and those public dollars eventually find their way into private pockets. Our market has not performed anything like the S&P 500. Our ASX 200 is up a mere 8.5 per cent year to date, compared to the 25 per cent on the S&P 500. Stripping out the miners, Macquarie finds the price to earnings ratio paid for the Australian market is near an all time high. Prices are at 22 times earnings, just under the post-COVID stocks boom when cheap money was flooding the economy and higher than the tech boom of the turn of the millennium. With stock prices so far ahead of earnings, something will eventually have to give. That’s why the US warning sign is becoming increasingly important because when the US sneezes, the world catches a cold. Macquarie has told clients it has already gone mostly defensive and advised them to pivot to health stocks like CSL and Resmed, real estate investment trusts and gold in advance of a US market meltdown. Even if the US maintains its momentum, Australian stocks don’t have much further to rise unless earnings start to catch up. For that to take place, interest rates here will have to fall. That’s why Macquarie takes the view that February is when investors should be looking to pick up any stocks like banks and tech companies that are linked to a cyclical economic upturn. It might be time to cash in and take a bit of pre-Christmas cheer, and keep an eye out for post-Christmas bargains.

Finally, Piper Sandler has raised the target for Meta shares, recognizing the company's impressive earnings results for 2024 and advancements in artificial intelligence.

Title: No evidence Brian Thompson was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi | Fact check

A Dec. 7 Threads post (direct link, archive link) claims to share news of a connection between the victim of a high-profile shooting and the former Democratic Speaker of the House. “BREAKING: Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was set to testify against Nancy Pelosi for insider trading,” reads text in the image, which is a screenshot of an X post. The Threads post received more than 600 likes in five days. Similar versions of the claim circulated widely on X, Instagram and TikTok. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page A spokesperson for California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said the claim is false. There is no credible evidence of an insider trading investigation into the former House speaker, much less that Thompson was scheduled to testify against her when he was killed. The claim that Thompson – who was fatally shot Dec. 4 on a Midtown Manhattan sidewalk – was scheduled to testify against Pelosi is false, Ian Krager, a spokesperson for the California congresswoman, told USA TODAY. There is no credible evidence indicating Pelosi is the subject of an insider trading investigation. No reputable media outlets have reported about it. Her name does not appear in a search of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s database of those charged between Oct. 1, 1995, and Sept. 30, 2024. Fact check: Image of job listing for UnitedHealthcare CEO after NYC shooting is fake Thompson, however, was accused of insider trading before his death, but there is no credible evidence Pelosi has any link to that allegation. He, along with parent company UnitedHealth Group and several other executives, were sued in May for alleged fraud and insider trading by the Hollywood (Florida) Firefighters’ Pension Fund. The lawsuit specifically accuses Thompson of selling more than $15 million of his UnitedHealth shares while the company was under a federal antitrust investigation that had not yet been disclosed to shareholders. Massachusetts Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey were among the more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers who signed a letter urging the SEC to investigate. Other versions of the claim that go into more detail unravel with a closer look at the facts. They attempt to link the February cyberattack that disrupted operations at UnitedHealth Group subsidiary Change Healthcare to a financial disclosure form filed by Pelosi. They falsely allege Thompson’s supposed testimony was scheduled after the congresswoman purportedly purchased $4 million worth of call options in a cybersecurity firm assessing the attack on the day it happened.No credible evidence or reports from legitimate media outlets exist about any investigation into Pelosi or supposed testimony scheduled for “a little over a week” after the Dec. 4 shooting. In addition, the versions of the claim that reference "the CEO of United" appear to confuse the company’s organizational chart. Thompson was the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, the nation’s largest health insurer and one of two distinct units of conglomerate UnitedHealth Group. The firm that was attacked – medical records processor Change Healthcare – is part of the Optum Insight subsidiary of Optum, the corporation's other unit. The CEO of parent UnitedHealth Group is Andrew Witty – not Thompson, who had no publicly known role in the attack response. Witty, meanwhile, was front and center in the aftermath, testifying during an April Senate hearing that the company paid a $22 million ransom. The claim also gets key details wrong about the stock sale. According to the disclosure form, which members of Congress are required under the STOCK Act to file, the purchase was made not by Pelosi – who has said she does not own any stocks – but by her husband, Paul, a venture capitalist and investor. The form shows that on Feb. 12, the day hackers broke into the company’s electronic portal, Paul Pelosi bought between $500,001 and $1 million in call options – which give the buyer the right to purchase an asset at a set price within a set time frame – in cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks Inc. Then, on Feb. 21 – when the hackers activated the ransomware and when UnitedHealth Group said Palo Alto and other security firms teamed with tech experts to respond to the attack – Paul Pelosi purchased up to $250,000 in additional call options, far less than the $4 million referenced in the claim. USA TODAY previously debunked false claims that Nancy Pelosi bought stock in a cannabis company before President Joe Biden issued federal marijuana pardons and in a company that makes a drug used to treat radiation sickness. Spokespeople for the SEC and the Justice Department did not immediately return requests for comment. When contacted by USA TODAY, the Instagram user who shared the claim pointed to a blog post about the lawsuit filed by the firefighters’ pension fund that makes no mention of Pelosi. USA TODAY did not immediately receive responses from several other social media users who were contacted after sharing the claim. PolitiFact and Lead Stories debunked versions of the claim.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on hot PPI data

Friday, 13 Dec 2024 NEW YORK, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks ended lower on Thursday, as a hotter-than-expected producer price index (PPI) report overshadowed earlier momentum in tech shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 234.44 points, or 0.53 percent, to 43,914.12. The S&P 500 sank 32.94 points, or 0.54 percent, to 6,051.25. The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 132.05 points, or 0.66 percent, to 19,902.84. Ten of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in red, with consumer discretionary and health leading the laggards by losing 0.84 percent and 0.83 percent, respectively. Meanwhile, consumer staples bucked the trend by rising 0.18 percent. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump rang the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday, marking a symbolic gesture to the financial community as he prepares to assume office. Addressing a crowd of traders and business leaders, Trump vowed to deliver an economic boom, signaling his administration's commitment to pro-growth policies, "we're going to give tremendous incentive like no other country has," including by cutting taxes "very substantially." However, the PPI released on Thursday morning, which tracks wholesale prices, rose 0.4 percent in November, double the 0.2 percent gain economists had expected, according to a Dow Jones poll. The data signaled persistent inflationary pressures, pushing the 10-year Treasury yield to its highest level in two weeks. Tech stocks led the day's decline. Nvidia dropped 1.41 percent, while Adobe tumbled 13.69 percent after issuing a weaker-than-expected outlook for 2025. Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon also traded slightly lower. This setback followed the consumer price index report earlier in the week, which aligned with economists' expectations and fueled optimism about a potential interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's meeting next week. Nevertheless, Thursday's PPI data introduced fresh uncertainties about the Fed's path forward. Also on Thursday, Stifel analysts project that the S&P 500 index will likely peak in the first half of 2025, driven by current market momentum and robust earnings. However, they warn of a subsequent 10 percent to 15 percent decline in the second half of the year. Stifel expects the Fed to pause its rate-cutting cycle, holding rates at 4 percent at its January policy meeting, posing risks to the markets around mid-2025. Report it to us.

Indexes closed lower on Thursday, dragged by tech stocks after the latest inflation report came in warmer than expected. Nvidia shares lost more than 1%, while Adobe stock fell almost 14% on a worse-than-expected revenue outlook. Tesla shares dropped 1.5% and climbing to record highs in the previous session. Google-parent Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon also ended lower. The Nasdaq retreated from its record above 20,000 set on Wednesday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell over 230 points. Here's where US indexes stood at the 4:00 p.m. closing bell on Thursday: The drop on Thursday comes as bond yields edged up after the latest producer price index report. The 10-year Treasury bond jumped six basis points to 4.332%. PPI showed wholesale prices rose 0.4% last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said Thursday. The data came in higher than consensus estimates of 0.2%. On an annual basis, wholesale inflation came in at 3%. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose in line with economists' expectations, rising 0.2%. The report marks the latest warm inflation reading after the release of the consumer price index on Wednesday, which showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November. That's slightly higher than October's 2.6% rise. While the latest inflation updates showed price growth re-accelerating slightly, it wasn't enough to derail expectations for a rate cut at next week's Federal Reserve meeting. Investors see another cut as basically a given, though the outlook for further easing becomes less clear in January and beyond. If inflation stays hot, it could prevent the Fed's ability to continue its easing cycle. Jobless claims on Thursday showed 242,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday. That number comes in above forecasts of 220,000 and marks the highest level since early October.

The company, trading under ticker symbol TTAN, sold shares at $71 apiece on Wednesday, above the expected range. The stock opened and closed at exactly $101 per share. Based on the closing price, the company's market cap was about $8.9 billion. ServiceTitan's IPO is notable because few tech companies have taken the leap into the public market since late 2021, when rising interest rates and soaring inflation pushed investors out of risky assets. ServiceTitan is the first significant venture-backed tech company to go public since Rubrik's debut in April. A month before that, Reddit started trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Other companies have suggested an IPO could be coming soon. Chipmaker Cerebras filed to go public in September, but the process was slowed down due to a review by the Treasury Department's Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS. Last month, online lender Klarna said it had confidentially filed IPO paperwork with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. While late-stage startups have been reluctant to take the public market leap, investors are showing a growing appetite for tech. "The reception is great. The water feels wonderful," Vahe Kuzoyan, ServiceTitan's president, told CNBC in an interview. Nina Achadjian, a partner at Index Ventures and ServiceTitan board member, said she's gotten many text messages from other venture capitalists saying the outcome opens up the window for more IPOs. On Wednesday, the Nasdaq Composite index closed above 20,000 for the first time. Tesla, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta all closed at records, with Apple just below its all-time high. ServiceTitan agreed to "compounding ratchet" terms as part of a 2022 funding round that valued the company at $7.6 billion, according to its prospectus. The decision "has put ServiceTitan on the clock to go public ASAP to minimize dilution impact," investors at venture firm Meritech Capital wrote in a blog post. But Ara Mahdessian, ServiceTitan's CEO, said Thursday that the terms didn't influence the decision to go public now. "Anti-dilution terms are not uncommon in financings," he said. Kuzoyan and Mahdessian created ServiceTitan in 2007. Before starting the company, Mahdessian said, his father was a jack of all trades, and Kuzoyan's father ran a plumbing business. On Wednesday, the founders' parents rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq in New York. ServiceTitan targets businesses in plumbing, landscaping, electrical and other trades, with software for managing sales leads, recording calls, generating quotes and scheduling jobs. As of Jan. 31, it had about 8,000 customers with more than $10,000 in annualized billings. The company's preliminary results for the October quarter show a net loss of about $47 million on $198.5 million in revenue. That suggests approximately 24% year-over-year revenue growth, the highest rate since mid-2023. But the company's net loss widened from around $40 million in the October quarter last year. "Our read is certainly that investors really value durable growth," Mahdessian said. "They value being cash-flow positive, which thankfully, we have been for the past several quarters." Bessemer Venture Partners, TPG and Iconiq Growth are among the company's top shareholders, alongside Kuzoyan and Mahdessian. At Thursday's closing price, ServiceTitan was valued at 12 times trailing 12 months revenue. The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund, a basket of more than 60 publicly traded cloud stocks, currently trades at about 6.4 times revenue.

Title: $11.5 Trillion BlackRock Recommends A 2% Bitcoin Allocation Comparing It To The Mag 7

New research from the world’s largest asset manager argues that Bitcoin offers unique benefits as a portfolio diversifier while sharing similar risk levels to S&P 500 juggernauts like Google, Amazon, Meta and Apple. BlackRock has been a big bitcoin ambassador to traditional finance (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images) With bitcoin crossing the $100,000 mark, the largest money manager on the planet, New York City-based BlackRock appears to be falling down a crypto rabbit hole. In a new release from Blackrock Investment Institute called “Sizing Bitcoin In Portfolios” its analysts are making the case that the cryptocurrency, long shunned by mainstream investors, should now account for 1% to 2% of traditional “60/40” investment portfolios. This would position the asset similarly to companies like Nvidia, Amazon, or Apple even though bitcoin has little utility other than as a speculative asset, and it derives no revenues from products like corporate titans. More than $5.2 trillion of Blackrock’s $11.5 trillion in assets under management are equities, which includes ETFs like iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) with $576 billion in assets. Allocating a mere 1% of Blackrock’s equity assets to bitcoin would equate to about $50 billion in net new demand for the digital asset. In the last 12 months bitcoin’s price has gained more than 130% compared to a gain of 32% for the S&P 500. BlackRock CIO for ETFs and Index Investments Samara Cohen In the research report, analysts led by the Chief Investment Officer of ETF and Index products Samara Cohen, write that the $2 trillion cryptocurrency offers a similar risk to the Magnificent 7 firms, whose average market capitalization is $2.5 trillion and have accounted for nearly 35% of the S&P 500’s $46 trillion market capitalization. “[Those stocks] provide an example of single portfolio holdings that account for a comparatively large share of portfolio risk. They differ from bitcoin in many ways, but these two factors make them a useful starting point for assessing the risk of a single holding.” Bitcoin has a total market capitalization of about $2 trillion. The BlackRock report also points out bitcoin’s historically low-correlation to traditional markets. Notes Cohen, “All equity managers who use a benchmark with the Magnificent 7 have this concentration risk, and they face a question of what to do about it. We are proposing this framework to think about an allocation that strikes the right balance, given the huge price volatility of Bitcoin, to maximize its potential as a diversifier while minimizing its contribution to overall portfolio risk.” While bitcoin was highly correlated to other asset classes, technology stocks, during the covid boom and bust, a divergence began in June 2023. The report suggests that this pattern will continue because of factors impacting bitcoin like the global fragmentation of the financial system, growing geopolitical tensions, a lack of confidence in banks, and growth in deficits. Bitcoin's correlation with equities has dropped post-Covid “You had 2022, a huge negative event, and then given the [high] level of interest rates in 2023, you could maintain a highly defensive posture with minimal risk primarily by holding cash-like instruments in your portfolio,” says Cohen. “In 2024, you have to face the reality of reinvestment risk, lower rates, and needing a long-term asset allocation.” In their analysis, Cohen and her team found that a 1-2% allocation in a 60/40 portfolio yields a risk similar to that of a Magnificent 7 stock. Bitcoin’s excessive volatility, however, which has caused it to drop as much as 70% in a year, makes higher weighting imprudent. A 1% weighting would contribute 2% of risk, while a 2% allocation increases the risk weighting to 5%. Another doubling in the weighting to 4% would account for an exponentially higher 14% of overall risk, according to the report. A 1-2% bitcoin allocation offers a similar risk to the average Mag 7 stock Though Blackrock only recommends a maximum of 2% for investors interested in diversifying with bitcoin, it does hint that future price gains may be more difficult. “The return characteristics are likely to change significantly once we reach a target state where potentially the portfolio allocation is much more tactical like gold and is used for hedging with a very different set of characteristics,” says Cohen. Increasing investor demand and rising bitcoin prices are already good business at Blackrock. In 2022, it partnered with Coinbase to enable institutional clients to buy bitcoin, and today, it operates the world’s largest bitcoin ETF, the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), with $50.8 billion in assets under management.

Shares of bitcoin miner Hut 8 (HUT) jumped nearly 12% in pre-market trading amid social media speculation that it is building a data center with Facebook owner Meta Platforms (META). The shares climbed to just under $30 as of 10:00 UTC. The CoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), which offers broad exposure to the BTC mining sector, rose about 3% higher. Neither Miami, Fla.-based Hut nor Menlo Park, Calif.-based Meta has announced a partnership. **Speculative Post**Hut 8 appears to be partnering with Meta to develop a groundbreaking AI data center in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana. While not officially confirmed, I’m led to believe this collaboration is likely, given the scale and focus of the project. The $12… https://t.co/E3PeEmsVnI pic.twitter.com/47xYttLaxP Hut 8 is building a data center in West Feliciana Parish, La. at an initial cost of $12 billion, local media has reported. Earlier this month, Meta said it was planning to build a $10 billion AI data center in Richland Parish, La., Reuters reported. There are similarities between bitcoin miners and AI data centers in the required equipment, computing power and energy to run it all. Some bitcoin miners have been dedicating resources to AI computation to diversify their revenue streams. Hut 8 previously announced a $500 million at-the-market (ATM) offering and a $250 million stock-repurchase program. The company has said it mined 94 BTC in November, a 6% month-on-month decrease. It holds 9,122 BTC ($921 million) on the balance sheet, the seventh-largest holder of bitcoin of any publicly traded company. Neither company immediately responded to CoinDesk's request for comment.

U.S. inflation meets expectations U.S. inflation quickened in November, climbing to 2.7% on-year from October's 2.6%, while core inflation — which strips out food and energy prices — remained unchanged at 3.3%. Both metrics were in line with forecasts. While the inflation rate was higher, the majority of traders still expect the Fed to lower its benchmark rate later this month, with the CME's FedWatch Tool reporting a 96% likelihood. Nasdaq reaches new high Alphabet and Tesla climbed to fresh highs on Wednesday, joining Amazon and Meta to propel the Nasdaq past 20,000 points for the first time. The four tech giants added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The Nasdaq Composite surged 1.77% to close at 20,034.89. The S&P 500 gained 0.82%, but the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.22%. Asian markets also mostly gained, with South Korea's Kospi leading the advance, up 1.78%. South Korea's "Korea discount" to remain entrenchedSouth Korean markets have had a dismal 2024, with the so-called "Korea discount" in its stock markets widening compared to other global peers. The recent political upheaval is expected to entrench this phenomenon as efforts to reform the South Korean markets take a back seat amid political turmoil in the country. OPEC cuts demand forecast againOPEC has cut its 2024 global oil demand growth forecast for a fifth straight month and by its largest amount yet, according to Reuters. OPEC expects global oil demand to rise by 1.61 million barrels per day, down from the previous forecast of 1.82 million bpd last month. It also cut its 2025 growth estimate to 1.45 million bpd from 1.54 million bpd. China accounted for part of the latest downgrade, with Chinese oil demand expected to rise by 430,000 bpd in 2024, down from 760,000 bpd increase predicted in July. [PRO] Alphabet's quantum leapThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the psychologically important 20,000-point mark for the first time ever on Wednesday, partly thanks to Alphabet's quantum computing breakthrough. Wall Street analysts predict the shares can run further. Tech investors were cheering Wednesday as four of the seven megacap tech stocks closed at all-time highs, with Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Alphabet adding roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. The gains in tech come as November's inflation reading met expectations. The reading clears the way for the Fed to cut rates, which is likely to send tech shares higher. The enthusiasm could be short lived, however, in light of U.S. president-elect Donald Trump's plans to raise tariffs which will likely be inflationary.The Fed will have to halt its easing cycle if inflation remains stubborn, removing one of the key impetuses behind the tech rally. Tesla, whose stock has risen by about 71% this year, may be the outlier since the bulk of its gains have come on the back of Trump's election victory last month. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has a cozy relationship with the president-elect, having contributed to Trump's campaign and is set to lead the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, alongside onetime Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy. His new role could give Musk power over federal agencies' budgets and staffing, as well as the ability to push for the elimination of inconvenient regulations. "The stock is responding to the Trump bump," Craig Irwin, an analyst at Roth MKM, told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" last week. Irwin increased his price target to $380 from $85, noting in a report that "Musk's authentic support for Trump likely doubled Tesla's pool of enthusiasts and lifted credibility for a demand inflection." On Wednesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs boosted their price target on Tesla, joining bullish reports from firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America. — CNBC's Lora Kolodny and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Title: 2025 Tech Year in Review: An Opinionated Guide to the Events that will have the Biggest Long-Term Impacts
URL: https://softwareas.com/2024-tech-year-in-review
Time Published: 2024-12-12T00:00:00Z
Full Content:
Four-year cycles - whether elections, Olympics, or World Cup - have long been a revealing way to observe changes in technology. (Fun fact: four years represents a more than a tripling in tech capability, if you take Moore’s Law as a generality, i.e. log(4)/log(1.5) ~= 3.4 ). In this election cycle, podcasts were a hot topic, with some dubbing it “The Podcast Election”. Both candidates went on presidential podcast tours alongside traditional rallies. Trump, in particular, appeared on at least fourteen podcasts, including some of the most popular podcasters across all genres. His VP, JD Vance, appeared on even more podcasts than Trump. Just as telling was the pressure and intrigue around a Joe Rogan appearance. Joe Rogan Experience is by no means a conventional political show, but is easily the most popular podcast in terms of audience and cultural influence. After much drama, Trump appeared weeks before the election, quickly followed by Vance, and leading to even more speculation around a Harris appearance that never happened and was blamed by some for losing the election (or at least, as an indicator that the winning candidate in future would need to be the kind of person who is comfortable appearing in this kind of space). The election also shows the limits of politicians generating their own podcast. Their external appearances were more decisive, and that’s because those podcasts have spent years building up loyal followings. Anecdotally, politicians around the world have taken note and are gearing up in their relations with podcasters. In other podcasting news, Lex Fridman demonstrated the possibilities of AI translation when he interviewed Argentina’s president. Fridman recorded the interview with him speaking English and with President Milei speaking Spanish; his podcast was then able to publish all-English and all-Spanish versions, both in their own voices. In coming years, we can expect to see all forms of media available in any language. This is an example of innovation that (a) boosts quality - since it’s possible to keep original voices and match face movements in video - while (b) smashing costs at the same time since it’s completely automated. The implications are dramatic as anyone with talent no longer needs to speak a major language in order to be discovered by the global community. This will lead to a further flattening of the world and winner-takes-all dynamic across media. It may also help with language preservation as it takes away some of the major motivations for people to learn a second language. On the theme of podcasts and influence, there was also a new podcast designed to promote an activist investor campaign, so that’s a first (as far as I know). The prominent activist investor Elliot launched the StrongerSouthwest podcast as part of an activist campaign against Southwest, It’s already gone, though, so I guess it was either a misfire or an overnight success? On a personal note, I predicted “2008 will be the Podcast Election” in ye olde podcast FAQ. That probably says more about my techno-optimistic bias than anything meaningful about podcasts or politics. Nuclear fission energy is enjoying a renaissance on multiple fronts. Institutions concerned with climate change have, to some degree, warmed to nuclear energy. The European Union, for example, finally included nuclear as part of its sustainable activities taxonomy (albeit “transitional” state for now). Anecdotally, there appears to be a generation gap among environmentalists, with older members sticking to the long-held party lines while newer members seeing the compromise as valid. While renewable energy tech has improved immeasurably, there’s still a big gap between tomorrow’s potential and today’s immediate needs. Sanctions and sentiment have caused many nations to become more open-minded about energy solutions. Oil was an exception made as part of sanctions against Russia and drives the economies of other countries with frozen relations. Then there’s AI and the every-growing needs of cloud providers. This was the marked change in 2024. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta all have big plans to fuel their data centres this way, which will validate the technology in the eyes of governments and businesses. These companies have driven entire revolutions when it comes to software, hardware, and network infrastructure, meaning we’re likely to see their brightest engineers breathe new life into nuclear, an industry that stagnated in the west for decades. The biggest AI story of 2024 was equal parts drama and substance, namely The Her Incident. In May, ChatGPT announced its upgraded voice assistant with an impressive set of demos. While ChatGPT already had a voice assistant for premium users, most people hadn’t noticed because (a) they’re not paying (the source of many falsehoods about ChatGPT’s capabilities) (b) it was not very good, particularly because it had a habit of jumping in with a pile of verbiage after the user makes the slightest pause, making it the world’s most superintelligent interrupter. Even founder/CEO Sam Altman was rubbishing it in his All-In interview, which as it turns out was just a few days before they would announce the voice upgrade. I’ll get the drama out of the way. The voice in the demos sounded suspiciously like Scarlett Johansson, the star of Her, the 2013 movie that envisioned the near-future reality of a lonely dude forming a romantic relationship with his intelligent voice assistant. Turned out she had been approached by OpenAI prior to this to license her voice for training, and declined. She subsequently expressed dismay and threatened a lawsuit as OpenAI pulled the Johansson-like voice option (“Sky”). As for the voice feature itself, remarkable. It’s getting tantalisingly close to speaking with a real human assistant. It’s fast. It gets straight to the point instead of waffling on like a long-form text-based chat session. It’s not perfect, but you can easily interrupt it and say something else if you feel it’s missed the point or is waffling on. While it might take a little while longer to match the conversation skills of an average human, one can’t lose sight that it already holds great advantages over any human, i.e., vast built-in knowledge on any subject, ability to look things up online and make sense of them in a fraction of a second, and always being present. Furthermore, many people just find it easier to work with voice than reading and typing - there’s a reason text-based social media like Twitter and Reddit never captured the masses like Instagram or TikTok. Even those who find comfort in text nevertheless find themselves equipped with the ability to multitask using their voice at the same time. Or use it while walking around or doing chores, just like people heretofore listen to music and podcasts. For these reasons, I believe we’re close to the tipping point envisioned in Her. The core functionality is already there; it’s just a matter of hardware integration to make communication seamless and always-available instead of having to pull out your phone and launch into a specific screen within a specific app. Voice was far from the only OpenAI upgrade this year. OpenAI also launched o1, their first model to be explicitly based on Chain Of Thought reasoning (CoT). Anthropic and Google likewise enhanced the reasoning capabilities of their models. To understand CoT, it’s important to be aware that a basic LLM works by producing one “token” (~ word) at a time, being guided by what has been composed up to that point. This is append-only, which is to say, there is no backtrack or explicit planning capability. It’s remarkable how well this has worked in practice. but still leaves opportunity for advanced strategies that would be closer to the way humans reason. In the simplest case, prompt engineering can be used, like appending an instruction with “think about this problem, outline the steps involved first, and address it step by step”. This can encourage the LLM to break down its response into sub-tasks and ensure each sub-task is more aware of what subsequent sub-tasks will need of it. Nevertheless, this is still a sequential activity. Chain-of-Thought goes a step further by baking reasoning directly into the model. With GPT 4-o, OpenAI refined GPT-4 by training it on examples of reasoning, where a complex task is broken into sub-tasks. Thus the LLM becomes inherently more capable at breaking any complex task into sub-tasks. A side benefit of this “divide-and-conquer” logic is a degree of transparency, where users can get some insight into the LLM’s inner workings. Indeed, ChatGPT updated its user-interface for 4-o to explicitly show steps as they’re being worked on before any response is produced. During this preparation phase, it conceptually has the ability to cycle through steps, go back and forth, before it finally begins outputting. In some cases, the LLM might “think” for 30 seconds or more, while for simpler tasks, it can immediately output an answer just like earlier models did. A future enhancement which will speed thing up is parallel processing, where the LLM can determine in advance that certain sub-tasks may be computed independently of each other, thus running them in parallel. Since a single human cannot multitask, this is another example where LLMs will be able to surpass human capability. After centuries of mythology and science-fiction - and decades of actual research - artificial humanoids are now becoming a reality. LLMs have been the most obvious beneficiary of AI research recently, but robotics stands to benefit from many of the same underlying technologies at both a software and a hardware level. In the same way LLMs benefitted from years of spend from video game enthusiasts, the nascent field of humanoid robotics is benefitting indirectly from spend on LLMs due to the value they are already delivering their customers today. China has long been investing heavily to automate manufacturing, thereby hoping to keep its lead even as the industry is disrupted by robotics, which could make it viable for some countries to promote a resurgence of local factories. Humanoid robotics is likely to form part of China’s strategy in this effort, and Chinese car maker BYD is also operating Walker robots on its assembly line. In the US, robotics startup Figure AI raised at a $2.6 billion valuation and announced Figure 02 in August. Figure robots worked on BMW’s assembly line as part of a trial this year. These industrial applications - where the robot’s environment is controlled and limited to repetitive tasks - should help to build confidence, revenue, and capability to expand into domestic applications over the next decade. Tesla is one company aiming to provide home robots and appears to be making good progress on its Optimus line. No-one would ever bet on Musk’s timelines, but for what it’s worth, the company claims it will be using 1000 robots internally next year. Tesla is a recent entrant and may not yet have caught up, but has among the deepest pockets and Musk has a track record of taking mere ideas from ideas to one. He also now finds himself with significant political power that will be helpful in attracting funding and navigating regulation. In 2024, DeepMind’s Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded Nobel prizes for the contribution to solving the “folding problem”. This is a decades-old effort to figure out how the shape of a protein molecule will turn out, based solely on the sequence of amino acids that constitute its raw ingredients. Being able to make such predictions is far more than an intellectual exercise, as it unlocks the ability to generate therapies through software models, which is much faster and easier to automate than conventional lab-based techniques. As with LLMs, AlphaFold achieves this by training on verified pairings of inputs and outputs. In this case, the inputs are amino acids and the outputs are 3-dimensional shapes. As was mentioned with respect to robotics, this is another area where the technology is converging across domains, leading to economies of scale that make all of those domains more productive. While the Nobel was awarded for earlier work, DeepMind achieved another milestone this year in launching AlphaFold 3. This is the first major version to expand its scope beyond protein molecules, into predicting shape of DNA and other small molecules. It it also more “automated” insofar as it doesn’t rely on certain knowledge and rules of physics and chemistry, i.e., it is more capable of figuring out these things on its own just by pattern-matching. This mirrors the broader trend in AI away from the pile of “hard-coded if-then statements” to “it just works” if you throw enough data and compute at the problem. There’s increasing interest in AI drug discovery, with one drug already in Phase 2 testing, and one of the enabling technologies is software that models how the body will respond to such interventions. Hence the relevance of AlphaFold. Its applications also go beyond therapies to industrial design such as new forms of plastics. Social media continued to fragment in 2024. The latest wave of X departures came after the US election, in which its owner-CEO completed his transition from self-described politically neutral to giving full-throated support to one candidate. In my experience, the algorithm has become unbearable under Musk’s management, not necessarily because of any political bias, but because everything is heavily off-topic from my interests and because I’ve lost any meaningful connection to my contacts. Add potential bias to the mix and it’s easy to see why people continue to abandon the platform. Surprisingly, it was BlueSky that picked up most of the followers rather than Meta’s Threads. Ever since 2022 - when Musk announced his takeover - there has been a never-ending cycle of communities moving from one place to another and back again. I wouldn’t confidently predict BlueSky will still be the big winner in 2025, but it would certainly be pleasing to see it reach critical mass, since there’s a world of potential in its open standards and ability for anyone to create a feed algorithm. The problem for all these platforms is fragmentation. Just as social media apps can rise quickly when they have a large user base, so can they collapse quickly as their user base dwindles. For this reason, it’s not surprising that apps are focused on curating the best content from across the whole network instead of worrying about the follower network. It makes them more attractive to new users who don’t have any contacts present or who have lost all their content to another platform. Nevertheless, it also removes one of the most powerful aspects of these apps in the first place. As Mark Zuckerberg mentions in just about every interview, his company is all about social connections, which makes it ironic to see an app like Threads focus so much of users’ attention on the celebrities of Instagram instead of those they follow. The biggest beneficiary may be a discussion app that never pretended to be about social connections. Reddit has always been about topics first, posts and comments second, user reputations a mere afterthought. After disappearing third-party apps in 2023, the site went public in 2024, making it the highest-profile tech IPO. The stock has performed exceptionally even taking to account the bull market backdrop, with a stock price gain of over 200%. Reddit operates in a similar space as X and its clones, all of them being geeky and fundamentally text-based platforms designed for discussions, debates, rants rather than the shallow entertainment scrollfests of Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. In a media landscape that is increasingly full of bots talking to other bots, Reddit’s topic-centric moderation model puts it in a good place as both a user experience and a training ground to sell on to AI platforms. AI may have taken the limelight away from headsets in recent years, but the Company Now Known As Meta continued to dive in the metaverse with a range of announcements concerning Extended Reality (XR). In this space, augmented reality (AR) has taken priority over virtual reality (VR). It seems that manufacturers have concluded VR is “cool” for games and demos, but it’s too isolating, too binary, insofar as it requires the user to don the headset and enter a separate mode of reality. You’re either in VR or you’re not. That’s similar to the experience of sitting down to use a desktop PC. In contrast, AR is more like a smartphone, and smartphones overtook PCs because you can take them anywhere and use them for tasks that are as short or as long as you wish. They’re integrated into your life rather than splitting your time into IRL and Second Life. With Oculus and Apple Vision Pro (another new product of 2024), their version of Augmented Reality is more accurately called Mixed Reality (MR). Cameras mounted on the headset give you the illusion you’re interacting with the real world while you’re in fact entirely locked inside the headset. From personal experience, both devices are getting impressively close to reality, but they still suffer from the headset form factor. You’re either in it or you’re not, and few people will dare to step in public with a $3000 machine strapped to their head. All of this makes Meta’s Orion Glasses the standout XR event of 2024. These glasses are very close to a conventional pair of specs, but true augmented reality via waveguides. The way this works is by light project directly on your retina via the glass, rather than “lighting up pixels” on the glass the way a conventional monitor or VR headset would, and more or less how Google Glass worked. Waveguides promise to deliver higher quality display while making the real world look more like the real world. Orion is still in early prototype stage, but reports from few external reviewers are optimistic, albeit on a tight set of use cases. Verge reported a game of Pong worked “surprisingly smoothly, and I noticed little to no lag in the game”. For an external Messenger call, “I could see and hear him well in the 2D window floating in front of me” . Meanwhile, Meta is pushing forward with its RayBan partnership - smart glasses with camera AI audio - which will gradually help it build up expertise in many other necessary technologies outside of the key Waveguide functionality. They appear to have avoided the stigma of Glass, and as I mentioned in my grading of 2023 predictions, they are going out of their way to force this issue early on by releasing a variant that is transparent and therefore shows the camera proudly to anyone who care. Public acceptance is vital to taking such a device mainstream and eventually replacing the smartphone. I mostly keep this blog politics-free, but can’t avoid observing the relevance of the US election to the technology sector. The next ivipresident’s inner circle now includes some of the most prominent venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. The next vice-president is a former venture capitalist who ascended to politics with the help of a prominent investor and is steeped in Silicon Valley culture. All of this especially matters because the president himself has shown little interest in technology, meaning his VP and advisors will be largely running the agenda. Dominic Cummings recently remarked that Silicon Valley, for a long time enjoyed keeping their distance and not having to worry about the political class in Washington who were largely ignorant towards technology. He noted that this was no longer feasible when technology became both a major influence of political power via social media and a matter of national security as with LLMs. He also argued the EU has stifled innovation through its privacy (GDPR) and AI regulation (AI Act), something he notes has been echoed even by EU-friendly actors such as President Macron. The tech folks in the White House are likely to block and repeal most efforts towards regulation, wanting to avoid the fate of the EU and stay competitive with China. While Vance has expressed some admiration for Lina Khan’s clamping down on monopolistic practices, I don’t think this will extend to the FTC’s stance on acquisitions since there’s a view VCs and founders are being denied of an exit. Thus it seems likely the next four years will see a number of high-profile companies - private unicorns and some public small/mid caps - being acquired. There’s also concern about lagging military technology and admiration for the more modern example set by DefenseTech startups such as Anduril, which focuses on fast-moving software-first approach and billing against specs rather than hourly labour, making its work arguably more in line with the needs of its clients in the defense industry. There’s likely to be increased initiatives aiming to foster this industry. Michael is a full-stack product maker. Curious about programming, tech, startups, and future trends.

Title: What Trended in Personal Finance in 2024?

However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. Table of Contents Table of Contents The battle to get here was certainly an uphill one, but people are generally feeling better about the economy and their finances than they once did. On top of that, the economy has been easing into an ideal, Goldilocks-like position — not running too hot or cooling too quickly. Throughout 2024, consumer sentiment data showed people were fairly positive about the economy and their own finances, even if there’s remaining frustration over elevated prices compared to four years ago. Looking ahead, households are feeling more optimistic about their personal finances in the next year, as the share of those expecting to be in a better financial situation a year from now hit its highest level since February 2020. Combine positive personal vibes with a strong economic picture and it looks like 2024 wasn’t so bad for consumers, after all. But that doesn’t mean there weren’t bumps in the road or potential roadblocks ahead. To cap off the year, NerdWallet writers reflect on the top trends in personal finance and the economy this year — and what they think might be ahead in 2025. Elizabeth Renter, NerdWallet’s economist What happened: In 2024, U.S. consumers have proven resilient following a period of high inflation and ongoing high interest rates. Wage growth has been strong, owing in part to rising productivity. This has driven robust spending throughout the year, which has kept the economy growing at a healthy pace. The labor market has remained steady, though cooler than 2023, and price growth continues to moderate towards the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation goal. What’s ahead: Barring significant changes to economic policy and significant shocks, the U.S. economy is expected to grow at a moderate rate in the coming year. Inflation will continue to moderate and the labor market will remain relatively healthy, all due in part to continued slow and deliberate rate cuts from the Fed. However, there are risks to this path. Higher tariffs and tighter immigration policies are likely, but the extent of these changes are yet unclear. The potential policy scenarios are many, and the economic outcomes complex. Increased tariffs are generally inflationary, and stricter immigration policies could impact the labor supply and economic growth. Consumers and small business owners with their eyes to the new year should focus on the things within their control. » MORE: How is the economy doing? Margarette Burnette, consumer banking and savings writer What happened: High-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit offered elevated rates in 2024, rewarding savers with strong returns. Following the Federal Reserve rate cuts in the second half of the year, high-yield accounts had modest rate decreases, but they continued to outperform traditional savings accounts and CDs. What’s ahead: We’re watching for further Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could lead to more decreases in savings rates. » MORE: What the Fed Rate announcement means for savings accounts Sara Rathner, credit cards writer What happened: Credit card debt levels hit record highs, with consumers turning to credit cards to pay for necessities. While the economy is doing well, many individuals have struggled to make ends meet, as incomes haven’t kept up with certain costs. What’s ahead: We may see some policy and regulation changes with the incoming administration that could affect folks when it comes to credit cards, debt and consumer protections. » MORE: 2024 state of consumer credit report Ryan Brady, small business writer What happened: New businesses continued to blossom in 2024 as business applications remained well above pre-pandemic levels. Confidence in the future state of the U.S. economy also spiked after the presidential election, but that optimism was tempered by concerns over rising costs and labor quality. What’s ahead: All eyes are on the incoming administration as small-business owners brace for turbulence resulting from potential tariffs, tax policy changes and dismantled government regulations. We’re also watching the possibility of interest rate cuts in 2025 and small-business owners’ growing reliance on new technologies, such as AI. » MORE: What Trump’s win means for small businesses Holden Lewis, mortgages writer What happened: Home buyers struggled with elevated mortgage rates, rising house prices and a shortage of homes for sale. On top of that, a new rule required buyers to negotiate their agents' commissions. What’s ahead: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut short-term interest rates, but mortgage rates might not necessarily fall by a similar amount. Buyers will probably have more properties to choose from, and the greater supply should keep prices from rising a lot. Interest rates on home equity loans and lines of credit should fall, making it less expensive to borrow to fix up homes — either to sell, or to make the home more comfortable and efficient. » MORE: Home sellers and buyers: What you must know for 2025 Sam Taube, investing writer What happened: The stock market had a great year. The S&P 500 is up more than 25% due to falling interest rates, fading recession fears, AI hype, and the possibility of lighter taxes and regulations under the new administration. Cryptocurrency also saw big gains in 2024; the price of Bitcoin crossed the $100,000 mark for the first time in December. What’s ahead: A lot depends on how fast the Fed reduces rates in 2025. Another key unknown is Trump’s second term. Regulatory rollbacks, such as those he has proposed for the banking industry, could juice stock prices — but they also could create systemic risks in the economy. His proposed tariffs could also hurt economic growth (and therefore stock prices). Finally, it remains to be seen whether trendy AI stocks, such as NVIDIA, can continue their momentum into next year. It’s the same story with crypto: How long will this bull market last? » MORE: 7 best-performing AI stocks Caitlin Constantine, assistant assigning editor, insurance What happened: Many people saw their home and auto insurance premiums skyrocket in 2024. In some states, homeowners are finding it harder to even find policies in the first place. Meanwhile, life insurance rates have started to decrease post-pandemic. We also saw more insurers offering online-only policies that don’t require a medical exam. What’s ahead: Auto and home insurance costs will likely continue to rise, although auto premiums may not rise as dramatically as they have over the past few years. And if you’re in the market for life insurance, expect to see competitive life insurance quotes and more customizable policies. » MORE: How to find the cheapest car insurance rates possible Eliza Haverstock, student loans writer What happened: Borrowers received historic student loan relief, but lawsuits derailed an income-driven repayment plan used by 8 million whose payments are indefinitely paused. Uncertainty will carry into 2025 as a result of the presidential administration change. What’s ahead: Trump has pledged to overhaul higher education and rein in student loan relief. The fate of the SAVE repayment plan, student loan forgiveness options, FAFSA processing and more remain in the balance. » MORE: Trump and student loans: What might happen and how borrowers can prepare Meghan Coyle, assistant assigning editor, travel What happened: People are willing to pay more for big and small luxuries while traveling, and airlines and hotels are taking note. Many airlines raised checked bag fees early in 2024, credit card issuers and airlines invested in renovated airport lounges, and major hotel companies continued to add luxury properties and brands to their loyalty programs. What’s ahead: Southwest will say goodbye to its open seating policy and introduce new extra-legroom seats, a major departure for the airline. Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines will unveil a unified loyalty program in 2025. Spirit Airlines may attempt to merge with another airline again after its 2024 bankruptcy filing and two failed mergers under President Biden’s administration. Travelers will find that they’ll have to pay a premium to enjoy most of the upgrades airlines and hotels are making. » MORE: Holiday airfare is down. Why isn’t travel spending? Laura McMullen, assistant assigning editor, personal finance What happened: This year, dynamic pricing expanded beyond concerts and travel to online retailers and even fast-food restaurants. This practice of prices changing based on real-time supply and demand received plenty of backlash from consumers and prompted the Federal Trade Commission to investigate how companies use consumers’ data to set prices. What’s ahead: Beyond an expansion of dynamic pricing — perhaps with added oversight — expect subscription models to become more prevalent and demand for sustainable products to grow. » MORE: Resistant to dynamic pricing? You’re likely already paying Shannon Bradley, autos writer What happened: New-car prices held steady in 2024 but remained high after a few years of sharp increases — the average new car now sells for about $48,000, and for the first time ever the price gap between new and used cars surpassed $20,000 (average used-car prices are now slightly more than $25,000). Overall, the car market returned to being in the buyer’s favor, as new-car inventories reached pre-pandemic levels, manufacturer incentives began making a comeback and auto loan interest rates started to decline. What’s ahead: The future of the car market is uncertain and depends on policies implemented by the incoming administration. Questions surround the impact of possible tariffs on car prices, whether auto loan rates will continue to drop, and if federal tax credits will still be available for electric vehicle buyers. » MORE: Average auto loan rates by credit score Jackie Veling, personal loans writer What happened: Buy now, pay later continued to be a popular payment choice for U.S. shoppers, even while facing headwinds, like an interpretive ruling from the CFPB (which determined BNPL should be regulated the same as credit cards) and Apple’s discontinuation of its popular Apple Pay Later product. Large players like Affirm, Klarna and Afterpay continued to offer interest-free, pay-in-four plans at most major retailers, along with long-term plans for larger purchases. What’s ahead: Though more regulation had been widely anticipated in 2025, the change in administration suggests the CFPB will play a less active role in regulating BNPL products. For this reason, and its continued strength in the market, BNPL will likely keep growing. » MORE: What is buy now, pay later? Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Easing inflation was a bright spot in 2024. In June, the consumer price index fell below 3% for the first time in three years. Consumers saw prices level off or decline for many goods, including for groceries, gas and new and used vehicles. But prices haven’t fallen far enough or broadly enough to relieve the pinch many households feel. What’s ahead: The new and higher tariffs proposed by the Trump administration could reignite inflation on a wide range of goods. » MORE: Food prices rose 28% in 5 years. Here’s why Taryn Phaneuf, news writer What happened: Rent prices remain high, but annual rent inflation slowed significantly compared to recent years, staying around 3.5% for much of 2024, according to Zillow, a real estate website that tracks rents. A wave of newly constructed rental units on the market seems to be helping ease competition among renters and forcing landlords to offer better incentives for signing a lease. What’s ahead: If it continues, a softening rental market could work in renters’ favor. But construction is one of several industries that could see a shortage of workers if the Trump administration follows through on its promise to deport undocumented immigrants. A shortage of workers would mean fewer houses and apartments could be built. » MORE: Rent prices keep rising amid inflation, low inventory Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: After a contentious presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump declared victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. While on the campaign trail, Trump promised to lower inflation, cut taxes, enact tariffs, weaken the power of the Federal Reserve, deport undocumented immigrants and more. Many economists have said Trump’s proposals, if enacted, would likely be inflationary. In Congress, Republicans earned enough seats to control both houses. What’s ahead: It’s unclear which campaign promises Trump will fulfill on his own and with the support of the new Congress. He has promised a slew of “day one” actions that could lead to higher prices, including across-the-board tariffs and mass deportations. Most recently, Trump pledged to enact 20% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, as well as an additional 10% tariff on China. He has also promised to extend or make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act; many of its provisions expire by the end of 2025. » MORE: What a Trump win means for your personal finances and the economy Anna Helhoski, news writer What happened: Fiscal year 2023-2024’s funding saga finally came to an end in March, then six months later, the battle to fund the fiscal year 2024-2025 began. The Biden Administration waged its own war against junk fees. Antitrust enforcers pushed back against tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta; prevented the Kroger-Albertsons merger; nixed the Jet Blue-Spirit Airlines merger; and moved to ban noncompete agreements. The Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, as well as a challenge to abortion pill access. SCOTUS also overruled its landmark Chevron case, which means every federal regulatory agency’s power to set and enforce its own rules are now weaker. What’s ahead: The election’s red sweep means the GOP will control the executive and legislative branches of government. They’ll face the threat of at least one more potential government shutdown; a debt ceiling drama comeback; and the beginning of the debate over extending or making permanent provisions of the expiring 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. » MORE: When will the government shut down?

Tech's seven trillion-dollar companies added roughly $416 billion in market cap for the day. For Alphabet, the two-day 11% rally was driven by the company's launch of its latest quantum computing chip, which it revealed on Monday and described as a "breakthrough" and "an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications" in drug discovery, battery design and other areas. Alphabet closed at $195.40 on Wednesday, topping its prior high of $191.18, which it reached on July 10. Tesla had been below its previous record for much longer. Shares of the electric vehicle maker jumped almost 6% on Wednesday to $424.77, climbing above their prior closing high of $409.97 on Nov. 4, 2021. The stock has soared 69% since Donald Trump's election victory last month, on Wall Street's optimism that Tesla CEO Elon Musk's cozy relationship with the incoming president will pay dividends. Amazon, Apple and Meta have all been regularly reaching new highs, though Apple slipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Microsoft, meanwhile, is about 4% below its high reached in July, and chipmaker Nvidia is 6% off its record from last month. The outsized weighting of tech's megacaps has pushed the Nasdaq to a 33% gain for the year. The index rose 1.8% on Wednesday to close at an all-time high of 20,034.89. The market has rallied since Trump's victory on Nov. 4, partly on expectations that the new administration will dial down regulatory pressure on the tech industry and allow for more dealmaking. On Tuesday, Trump named Andrew Ferguson as the next chair of the Federal Trade Commission, replacing Lina Khan, who is best known for blocking the top tech companies' acquisition efforts. Ferguson, currently one of the FTC's five commissioners, "will be the most America First, and pro-innovation FTC Chair in our Country's History," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. Tom Lee, managing partner at Fundstrat Global Advisors, told CNBC's "Closing Bell" that investors see more gains in tech with the expectation that a Federal Reserve rate cut is coming this month. The consumer price index showed a 12-month inflation rate of 2.7% in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Wednesday, further solidifying the market outlook for a cut. "We know that when interest rates fall, the megacaps actually are very sensitive to that, and I think today was a day where the odds of a December cut increased," Lee said. "That's actually bullish for tech." WATCH: What Fundstrat's Tom Lee expects from the markets in 2025 Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: Elon Musk is so rich he makes Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg look poor

Time Published: 2024-12-11T18:19:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk was already the richest person on the planet. Now, thanks to Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX’s surging valuations, he’s worth more than $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations. Specifically, he’s worth $439.2 billion. For reference, the next richest men alive are Amazon (AMZN-0.55%) founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, Meta (META-1.68%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle (ORCL-1.58%) Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. They’re worth, respectively, $244 billion, $219 billion, and $197 billion. Musk is also at least as wealthy as Mansa Musa, the emperor of the West African Mali Empire and previous record holder of richest man to ever live, who historians estimate was worth around $400 billion, according to the BBC. The impetus for Musk’s latest surge in wealth is SpaceX’s newfound value of $350 billion, which makes it the most valuable startup in the world. On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to buy $1.25 billion of shares from employees and company insiders. “What’s really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation! SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in,” Musk wrote on his X Wednesday. Besides SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and owner of X. Corp. His other companies include artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip firm Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company. xAI, recently raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation less than two years after he founded it. That’s also more than double its valuation in May, when it was valued at $24 billion at a value of $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Musk owns more than 13% of Tesla shares, which have surged since President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The stock climbed to a new record of $415 per share on Wednesday, narrowly surpassing its prior record for intraday trading of $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk has said that ending those credits will hurt Tesla’s rivals more than it damages his company, although analysts expect some downside in the short term. Several analysts have also raised their price targets for the stock in recent days as they look to catch up with the stock surge, often pointing to Tesla’s plans for driverless vehicles and humanoid robots.

If you're considering an electric vehicle for your next car, there are various factors — like your anticipated daily mileage and charging needs — to consider. Before buying, you may also want to think about EVs that are eligible for tax credits, which can lower the cost of your overall purchase. Whether you go with a fully electric or hybrid model, there are plenty of new, used, and coming versions of this more sustainable car type to choose from. In "Getting Ready for Electric," a series of shopping guides, Business Insider has been exploring the ins and outs of EV purchasing. Read on for the best tips for shopping for your next EV. Battery ranges can vary depending on your driving habits and the climate of where you live. While driving a few dozen miles daily in a moderate climate like Florida could open a buyer to a wide variety of EV options, someone who drives hundreds of miles daily and lives in a locale prone to colder temperatures may have fewer options overall, Scott Case, a cofounder and the CEO of Recurrent, a startup that tracks EV-battery health, previously told BI. Newer models tend to accommodate long-haul driving needs better than older models, but they usually have higher price tags. The federal government offers tax incentives on certain EVs, while some states have rebate programs that can lower the cost of your purchase. Each of these discount methods has its own requirements and varies for new versus used EVs. For example, to get a federal tax credit of up to $7,500, your new EV must have: If you meet some but not all of the requirements, you may qualify for a smaller tax credit. When it comes to used EVs, you may be eligible for a tax credit — 30% of the vehicle price, up to $4,000 — if you have: For the EV-curious who don't want to pay for a yearslong commitment, the leasing approach could be the way to go. Unlike bought EVs, leased ones fall into a different tax-incentive category because they don't undergo the same complex parts-sourcing process and don't have the same income caps. Because of this distinction, dealerships get a $7,500 federal tax credit for each of their EVs. That's where the EV-leasing loophole comes in: Many dealerships are opting to pass these credits onto their lessees. That extra cash, bumper-to-bumper coverage, and the ability to return the car at the lease's end are benefits worth considering when shopping. The Department of Energy reported that there are more than 61,000 EV charging stations nationwide, double the number in 2020. The majority of Americans — 95%, a Pew Research Center study found — live in counties with at least one of these stations. If you're close to one of these stations, an EV could be a convenient and inexpensive alternative to a gas-powered car. Though more of an investment, at-home EV chargers can make your green-car purchase that much more worthwhile, Jenni Newman, the editor in chief of Cars.com and an EV owner, previously told BI. Not all public charging ports are compatible with all EV car models, and drivers have reported coming across broken chargers. An at-home charging setup could eliminate those issues. EV owners can charge their cars within hours or overnight — a slower method that can prolong battery life — and end up with 250 to 300 miles of driving range without leaving their driveways. These setups range in cost — from $250 to $7,000 — depending on your outlet location, the voltage your electric panel can support, and the speed at which you want to charge your vehicle. Like with buying or leasing an EV, there are charger tax credits available from the federal government. As automakers adjust their EV-manufacturing strategies, they're investing in more hybrid EVs and models at lower price points. Because of these strategic changes in the car industry, you can expect a bigger menu of EV options for both fully electric and hybrid cars. Jump to

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq tops 20,000 for first time as Big Tech surge leads stocks higher

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices.

Title: Class-action lawsuit against microchip company Nvidia to proceed, Supreme Court says

Double your support for intelligent, in-depth, trustworthy journalism. Associated Press Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court is allowing a class-action lawsuit that accuses Nvidia of misleading investors about its past dependence on selling computer chips for the mining of volatile cryptocurrency to proceed. The court’s decision Wednesday comes the same week that China said it is investigating the the microchip company over suspected violations of Chinese anti-monopoly laws. The justices heard arguments four weeks ago in Nvidia’s bid to shut down the lawsuit, then decided that they were wrong to take up the case in the first place. They dismissed the company’s appeal, leaving in place an appellate ruling allowing the case to go forward. At issue was a 2018 suit led by a Swedish investment management firm. It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. READ MORE: Supreme Court hears arguments on study requirements for environmental regulators In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia’s recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies. The justices also dismissed an appeal from Facebook parent Meta that sought to end to a multibillion-dollar class action investors’ lawsuit stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.

Learn More Incorporating some of the Blog Bundle products into your website is simple. We’ll walk you through installing and styling some plugins to show you how easy it is to boost your blog’s look and feel. Before we can revamp our blog, we first have to install the plugins. Start by logging into your WordPress admin dashboard. Locate the plugins tab and click Add New Plugin. Next, click the Upload Plugin button at the top left of your screen. Click the Choose File button and locate the first plugin, Divi Blog Extras, on your computer to upload. Once loaded, click Install Now. Once the plugin is installed, click the Activate Plugin button. Follow the steps above to install the remaining plugins: DiviSwift Ajax Search and Divi Table Of Contents Maker. Our last product, the Divi Blog Module Pack, requires a different setup that we’ll review in the next step. Note: For DiviSwift Ajax Search to function correctly, you must have WooCommerce installed. As mentioned, the Divi Blog Module Pack is installed slightly differently than a plugin. Within the main folder, you’ll find several folders and files. The folders contain all the layouts in the pack for carousel styles, module grid view styles, and module list view styles. To make things easier to decipher, the developer created a catch-all JSON file that allows you to install all layouts in the pack. To install the layouts, click on Divi > Divi Library in the WordPress dashboard. Next, click the Import & Export button at the top right of the Divi Library screen. Click the import tab and select Choose File. Navigate to the unzipped Divi Blog Module Pack file on your computer. We will only install some of the layouts in the pack. Instead, we’ll select the DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80 folder as illustrated below. Click to open the folder. Select the All_DCT_Blog_Module_Grid_View_Styles_80.json file to import into the Divi Library. With the file loaded, choose if you want to import presets, then click Import Divi Builder Layouts. Once all layouts are loaded, they will appear in the Divi Library. While you can’t preview the layouts in the Divi Builder, you can view them on the developer’s website. There, you’ll find all grid view, list view, and carousel layouts conveniently numbered to correspond with the layout titles in the Divi Library. For our blog page, we’d like a hero section showcasing one post from our blog. To do this, create a new single-row section at the top of your blog page. Click to add the Divi Blog Extras module to the row. When the module settings open, choose the layout from the Blog Layout dropdown menu. We’ll select Box Extended. Under the query tab, choose the post type and post count. We’ll select 1 for this section. Be sure to choose the appropriate category as well. Under elements, choose the settings you’d like to use, including whether to show the featured image, read more links, author, date, and other meta information. The design tab allows you to style the title, body text, author, and meta info. If your site uses global colors and fonts, you won’t have to make any changes to make the module match your branding, as Divi Blog Extras will automatically load your preferences. Next, we’ll add a layout from the Divi Blog Module Pack to display our remaining blog posts. Add a new row beneath the hero section to add a pre-made layout from the pack. Next, click the Add From Library tab. When the dialog box appears, click on a layout from the pack. We’ll select style 26. Once the layout is loaded, you can modify it directly in the Visual Builder to suit your preferences. Two code modules are present: one for JavaScript and one for CSS. The CSS code module can be altered to match your branding, including button and background colors, animations, and more. Before exiting the Visual Builder, we must save the updated section to our Divi Library. This will assist us in making an archive template in the next step. To save the section, hover over it to reveal the settings. Click the ellipsis menu at the top right corner of the section. Next, click Save to Library. Give the layout a recognizable name, choose the appropriate options, and click Save to Library. After making your changes, you can save the page to view the new blog page. Now that we have our main blog page styled, the next step is to create an archive page for search results. We will incorporate the Divi Blog Extras plugin to do this. We’ll need to enable some settings to create our archive page, so let’s start by navigating to Settings & Divi Blog Extras. On the settings page, click the Custom Post Types tab. Here, you can enable custom post types and custom taxonomies in modules. This allows you to add custom post types to the Divi Blog Module to showcase content other than blog posts. This can be useful for all kinds of websites, including real estate sites, portfolios, and ecommerce sites. You can enable various layouts for categories, tags, author pages, dates, and taxonomies in the Archives tab. Click to allow the toggle on each tab or the tabs where you’d like to use a custom layout. For example, when you enable the category archive layout, you’ll be prompted to select a Divi Library layout with at least one Divi Blog Extras module. Since we created a blog page with a Divi Blog Extras module, we’ll use that one for our archive template. Choose whether to use a sidebar or a full-width layout and click Save Changes to continue. Once enabled, Divi Blog Extras will revamp your category page with a more streamlined look. Another way to boost your blog is to add a table of contents to your blog posts. A table of contents makes long-form content easy to navigate, which helps your visitors find what they want. The easiest way to accomplish this is to add a TOC to your blog post Theme Builder template. Start by navigating to Divi > Theme Builder. Here, you’ll find all of the templates associated with your website. Most existing Divi websites will already have a blog post template, so all you’ll need to do is edit it. If not, you can easily create one using a combination of Divi Modules. For this post, we assume you either already know how to make a template or already have one. Once in the Theme Builder, locate the template associated with your blog posts. Click the custom body section to edit it. Click to add a new row below the featured image. Locate the Table Of Contents Maker module and click to add it to the template. Next, you’ll configure the content settings. You can show or hide the header, include all headings or pick specific heading levels, add keyword text highlights, adjust scroll speed, and more. In the design tab, you can style the module’s header, title text, icons, keyword highlights (if enabled), and more. Once you have the settings in place, save the template and preview one of your posts to see how it looks! The last step is configuring the search options for the DiviSwift Ajax Search extension. By default, DiviSwift Ajax Search integrates with the standard Divi Search Module and the search functionality within your site’s main header. Whether you use the standard header or create a global header template, the extension’s functionality is already built in. The only thing you need to do is style it to match your existing site. To configure its settings, navigate to Divi > Ajax Search in the WordPress dashboard. Once clicked, the Divi Theme Customizer will launch to reveal the extension’s settings. Here, you can customize the search text, choose the contents to display, and customize the other results text. You can also configure options for out-of-stock products, exclude specific pages from search results, or hide product variations. DiviSwift also allows you to customize the search module’s border, background, buttons, and highlights. Once you make the desired changes, publish them. Then, you can test the functionality and make additional changes as needed. You can make big changes to enhance your blog by purchasing the Cyber Monday Blog Bundle. Although we only used a few products from the bundle in this post, it’s easy to see how beneficial it is. In just a few minutes, you can add features and functionalities to your blog that will make it easier for visitors to find what they are looking for, enhance the look and feel of your blog posts and pages, and add user-friendly search technology with little effort.

It followed a dip in the profitability of cryptocurrency, which caused Nvidia’s revenues to fall short of projections and led to a 28% drop in the company’s stock price. Nvidia had argued that the investors’ lawsuit should be thrown out because it does not measure up to a 1995 law, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, that is intended to bar frivolous complaints. A district court judge had dismissed the complaint before the federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that it could go forward. The Biden administration backed the investors at the Supreme Court. “This is a win for corporate accountability. When corporations mislead shareholders, they undermine trust in our markets. Ensuring that investors can seek justice is essential to preserving fairness and transparency," Deepak Gupta, who represented the investors at Supreme Court, said in a statement. In 2022, Nvidia, which is based in Santa Clara, California, paid a $5.5 million fine to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission that it failed to disclose that cryptomining was a significant source of revenue growth from the sale of graphics processing units that were produced and marketed for gaming. The company did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Nvidia's recent performance has been spectacular. Even after the news of the China investigation, its share price is up 180% this year. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants continue to spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The lawsuit is one of two high court cases that involved class-action lawsuits against tech companies.

Donald Trump Truth Social 01:11 PM EST 12/08/24… pic.twitter.com/JYamMQeHYr — Donald J. Trump Posts From His Truth Social (@TrumpDailyPosts) December 8, 2024 * * * “Trump allies adopt new strategy for nominees: Make the doubters pay” [Politico]. “Donald Trump’s transition team entered a critical week of nomination meetings on Capitol Hill with a new head of steam, emboldened by a swarm of grassroots support and a pressure campaign that has revived Pete Hegseth’s hopes for Defense secretary and given them confidence about other controversial nominees, too. In recent days, allies of Trump adopted an approach that is not novel for the president-elect and his followers: Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. The swarm of MAGA attacks that Sen. Joni Ernst has experienced is a warning of what’s in store for others who express skepticism of his personnel choices.” “Growing momentum for Cabinet picks who could define Trump’s second term” [CNN]. “he Cabinet confirmation drama around Donald Trump’s most provocative picks [is] mostly about Trump himself, and the kind of presidency he wants, the one he will end up getting, and the hopes of his MAGA movement that he’ll stand firm on his vow to shake the federal administrative state to its core and enact his and their revenge.” As for Ernst: “The Iowa Republican had faced warnings on social media that she’d encounter a primary challenge in 2026 if she didn’t shelve her reservations about Hegseth. The president-elect’s son, Donald Trump Jr., last week, for instance, amplified a post on X that pointed out that Ernst had been among almost all GOP senators who voted to confirm President Joe Biden’s Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, saying that anyone who did so and then criticized Hegseth was maybe ‘in the wrong political party!'” “‘I Support Pete’: Ernst Changes Tune Following Second Hegseth Meeting” [The Federalist]. “Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, indicated she will confirm Pete Hegseth as the next secretary of defense on Monday. The announcement marks a stark pivot for Ernst, who has been leading a behind-the-scenes effort to tank Hegseth’s nomination. ‘I appreciate Pete Hegseth’s responsiveness and respect for the process,’ Ernst said in a press release. ‘Following our encouraging conversations, Pete committed to completing a full audit of the Pentagon and selecting a senior official who will uphold the roles and value of our servicemen and women — based on quality and standards, not quotas — and who will prioritize and strengthen my work to prevent sexual assault within the ranks. As I support Pete through this process, I look forward to a fair hearing based on truth, not anonymous sources.'” “Key GOP senators begin to fall in line to support Kash Patel and keep door open for Pete Hegseth” [CNN]. “Top GOP senators on Monday signaled support for Donald Trump’s plan to oust the current FBI director in favor of firebrand loyalist Kash Patel, while keeping the door open for Pete Hegseth, who faces a slate of misconduct allegations, as the president-elect’s pick to run the Pentagon…. It is still early in the vetting process for Trump’s Cabinet nominees and confirmation votes won’t take place until next year. But it is clear that GOP senators are being careful to pick their battles and cautious of how they approach the president-elect’s selections.” * * * “Cold Shoulder: Democrats Ignore Tulsi Gabbard’s Request To Meet” [CNN]. Worst of all, Gabbard was a DNC vice-chair, but resigned to endorse Sanders. “There is some evidence that skepticism of a muscular foreign policy has gained traction among younger Democrats and independents in the last four or five years. When Hillary Clinton questioned Gabbard’s logic and loyalty, Gabbard punched back. In a series of tweets, she called the former secretary of State and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee “the queen of warmongers” and “personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.'” • Where’s the lie? The #Resistance “Sanctuary cities resist Trump’s deportation plan. It could cost their residents” [USA Today]. “While a post-election poll by YouGov for CBS News shows that a massive 73% of adults want President-elect Donald Trump to prioritize the repatriation of illegal migrants, the [Denver Mayor Mike Johnston] pledged to not only have Denver police ‘stationed at the county line to keep (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) out’ but also that ‘you would have 50,000 Denverites there.’ Johnston said it would be like a ‘Tiananmen Square moment’ and answered yes when questioned whether he’d be ready to go to jail. That moment soon passed, however, as lawyers apparently explained to the mayor that armed resistance to the federal government is often called – wait for it – insurrection.” • Oopsie. Democrats en déshabillé “Russiagate Remnants” [Michael R. Caputo, Racket News]. “All of us agree the original Russiagate conspiracy continues even today. The Russia hoax was created by Hillary Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, who carries on with his lies today as President Joe Biden’s national security advisor. Christopher Steele, the British spy hired by Clinton to create the dodgy dossier, and his Fusion GPS co-conspirator Glenn Simpson are still doing the same work for similar clients. Andrew Weissmann, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, and more still peddle their lies. Elements of the original conspiracy were woven into Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 American election, then bogus Trump impeachments, January 6th prosecutions, anti-Trump lawfare, and Special Counsel Jack Smith’s Mar-a-lago raid. FBI Director Patel can prove the original 2016 conspiracy continues today. Much of the evidence remains in federal and public databases. Preemptive pardons aside, that means Sullivan, Weissmann, Mary McCord, Steele, Simpson, Victoria Nuland, Alexander Vindman, Eric Ciaramella, Smith, and others may still be in the jackpot. We agree with attorney Mike Davis: these perpetrators potentially violated 18 U.S.C. § 241 and 242, federal civil rights statutes that prohibit conspiracies to violate the rights of others.” • Worth reading in full.

Airborne Transmission “AirFanta 3Pro Review – A High-Performance Yet Affordable Air Purifier” [BreatheSafeAir]. “After having the 3Pro set up inside my office for over two weeks now, I am happy to be able to present my full review of the device. For anyone unaware, this purifier is designed to filter a massive amount of air (we will discuss the CADR and more soon!) at a relatively affordable price. It does this by being essentially a pre-assembled CR (Corsi-Rosenthal) Box – a form of air purifier that was itself created due to the need for affordable and effective air purification devices. While the 3Pro doesn’t embrace the typical DIY aspect of traditional CR Boxes, it has the advantage of having proven performance (no need to worry about whether your DIY box is effective!) and being ready to go out of the box. However, perhaps my favourite aspect of this device over traditional CR Boxes is how easily obtainable it is. While this probably isn’t an issue for anyone in the U.S. or Europe, I find it hard to source good HEPA filters in New Zealand at an affordable price. The 3Pro ensures I don’t run into this issue.” • Worth a read if you’re in the market.

It is also the first time in 34 months that the reading is above the 50-year average of 98, in response to the presidential election. “The election results signal a major shift in economic policy, leading to a surge in optimism among small business owners. Main Street also became more certain about future business conditions following the election, breaking a nearly three-year streak of record high uncertainty. Owners are particularly hopeful for tax and regulation policies that favor strong economic growth as well as relief from inflationary pressures. In addition, small business owners are eager to expand their operations”, NFIB Chief Economist Bill Dunkelberg.” * * * Manufacturing: “Exclusive-Boeing restarts 737 MAX production a month after strike ended, sources say” [Reuters]. “Production resumed on Friday, said one of the sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak with media.

The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Mike Whitaker, told Reuters on Thursday that Boeing had not yet resumed 737 MAX production but planned to do so later this month.” Manufacturing: “Boeing shares jump as 737 MAX production reportedly resumes” [Sharecast]. “The stock was up nearly 5% at $164.80 by 1034 in New York, trading at levels not seen since late-August.” Tech: “AI slop is already invading Oregon’s local journalism” [Oregon Public Broadcasting (PI)]. “The Daily Tidings appears to be the first time an Oregon news outlet has stolen the identities of real journalists to trick local readers with AI-generated content.

I believe that people can have rich, fulfilling lives with or without partners; I also know that courtship has never been easy. But research supports the idea that, in recent years, the United States has seen a particularly pronounced crisis of faith in romance. The Pew Research Center, in an analysis of census data, found that as of 2019, 38 percent of adults were unpartnered—that is, not married or living with a partner—compared with 29 percent in 1990. In a survey Pew conducted that same year, half of single adults said they were not seeking dates. When Pew divided that result by gender, it found that 61 percent of single men said they were looking to date or find a relationship while only 38 percent of single women said the same. In other words, straight partnerships seem to be going out not with a 4B-style bang but with a whimper. And however subtle the shift might seem, it has huge implications for men and women: how they treat each other, whether they’re willing to trust each other, and how they’ll build their futures—together or apart.” • Hmm. Guillotine Watch “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” [Yahoo News]. Better there than in the corridors of power at the EU and NATO. Oh, wait…. “A German property developer has sparked outrage with a plan to turn a World War II tunnel system into a luxury bunker for rich survivalists who fear the outbreak of World War III. Relatives of the prison labourers who built it under the Nazis are aghast at the business venture that is offering a crypto-currency called ‘BunkerCoin’ as entry tokens to the promised apocalypse shelter.” • Of course, Crypto.

News of the Wired “Colour in the Middle Ages” [Medievalists.net]. “Michel Pastoureau writes that “the true medieval opposite for white was not so much black as red.” This can be seen in the way Europeans adapted chess. When the game was adopted in Europe, the pieces and chessboard were painted in white and red, contrasting with the black and red sets common in India and the Middle East. It was only towards the end of the Middle Ages that the white versus black dichotomy became more favoured. A key factor in this shift was the advent of printing, where black ink was used on white paper, reinforcing the perception of these colours as natural opposites.” “Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension” [Educational Research Review] 2018. From the Discussion: “The results of the two meta-analyses in the present study yield a clear picture of screen inferiority, with lower reading comprehension outcomes for digital texts compared to printed texts, which corroborates and extends previous research (Kong et al., 2018; Singer & Alexander, 2017b; Wang et al., 2007). These results were consistent across methodologies and theoretical frameworks.” And: ” our results indicate that the screen inferiority effect has increased in the past 18 years, and that there were no differences in media effects between age groups. These surprising findings suggest that we cannot idly wait for screen inferiority to disappear as children are exposed to digital devices earlier and earlier in their lives, as adults gain more experience with the technology, or as technology improves. The data suggest that screen inferiority is a major challenge across age groups that becomes more severe as the presence of technology increases.” • Certainly conforms to my priors! * * * Contact information for plants: Readers, feel free to contact me at lambert [UNDERSCORE] strether [DOT] corrente [AT] yahoo [DOT] com, to (a) find out how to send me a check if you are allergic to PayPal and (b) to find out how to send me images of plants.

Thank you! Readers, I have had a correspondent characterize my views as realistic cynical. Let me briefly explain them. I believe in universal programs that provide concrete material benefits, especially to the working class. Medicare for All is the prime example, but tuition-free college and a Post Office Bank also fall under this heading. So do a Jobs Guarantee and a Debt Jubilee. Clearly, neither liberal Democrats nor conservative Republicans can deliver on such programs, because the two are different flavors of neoliberalism (“Because markets”). I don’t much care about the “ism” that delivers the benefits, although whichever one does have to put common humanity first, as opposed to markets. Could be a second FDR saving capitalism, democratic socialism leashing and collaring it, or communism razing it. I don’t much care, as long as the benefits are delivered. To me, the key issue — and this is why Medicare for All is always first with me — is the tens of thousands of excess “deaths from despair,” as described by the Case-Deaton study, and other recent studies. That enormous body count makes Medicare for All, at the very least, a moral and strategic imperative. And that level of suffering and organic damage makes the concerns of identity politics — even the worthy fight to help the refugees Bush, Obama, and Clinton’s wars created — bright shiny objects by comparison. Hence my frustration with the news flow — currently in my view the swirling intersection of two, separate Shock Doctrine campaigns, one by the Administration, and the other by out-of-power liberals and their allies in the State and in the press — a news flow that constantly forces me to focus on matters that I regard as of secondary importance to the excess deaths. What kind of political economy is it that halts or even reverses the increases in life expectancy that civilized societies have achieved? I am also very hopeful that the continuing destruction of both party establishments will open the space for voices supporting programs similar to those I have listed; let’s call such voices “the left.” Volatility creates opportunity, especially if the Democrat establishment, which puts markets first and opposes all such programs, isn’t allowed to get back into the saddle. Eyes on the prize! I love the tactical level, and secretly love even the horse race, since I’ve been blogging about it daily for fourteen years, but everything I write has this perspective at the back of it. Printed books, cards, and tabletop games come in handy during power outages. Don’t throw away your printed books: A meta-analysis on the effects of reading media on reading comprehension I have been harping on this for some time, especially in regards to NC content. Good meaty posts and whenever Yves tells me to get a cup of coffee means I invariably copy and paste the words into a word processor and print it out. One could also hit the “Printer Friendly and PDF” at the end of the post, but I prefer the fancy OpenType fonts I have already installed in the word processor. Reading text on paper as opposed to monitors and phones will save your eyes, and your comprehension and memory of the content will be deeper. For example, I printed Rob Urie’s post today on the state of greedy health insurance. Of course, this means I miss out on participating in the comments. i have an old trailerhouse full of books. i call it “The Library”. but i can no longer read any of them without getting a headache or eyestrain. because i cant afford to go to the eye doctor(after almost 9 years) to get new real eyeglasses. so i’m stuck with “walmart readers” of varying magnification…yellow/green ones for in here in my bed, with laptop at the foot of it….purply ones for out at the bar…brown ones for in the truck…last actual prescriptions, held together with caulk, superglue and tape, in the golf cart. on the laptop, whether here, in bed, or out at bar, i an make these letters frelling huge, and do just that. i reckon that more healthcare executives need to be shot on the side of the road for the message to get through,lol. “Access to Healthcare” makes a nice slogan you can yammer on about…and your PMC healthcare might be awesome….but i have none at all….as do so very many of my compatriots. and when we hear how awesome obamacare is, in Texas, well…look over yer shoulder for the rest of your natural, and likely artificially extended, life. (i’m busy thinning the damned catherd, so have no bullets to spare) Meanwhile, back at the gerontocracy ranch: https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5032783-mcconnell-falls-medical-attention/ I appreciate your explanation of end of term legislation. The need however for members of Congress to express disdain for a civilization of 1.4 billion thoroughly benign people is saddening. At least this can be otherwise dismissed. Thank you so much. I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern. It is quite valid. And it is possible the same bill will come up in the next Congress, but it has to start from scratch – find sponsors, go through committees, etc. Congressional procedures can be arcane. These guys know how to work it. “I didn’t mean to dismiss your concern…” You are terrific. Where’s the lie? There isn’t one of course, which is a problem because truth and trust are the costly enemy, but lies, ignorance, and hatred are their profitable friends. And the Democrats reflexively, without any deliberations, destroy anyone who they think is the enemy Indeed. I think Gabbard will be the hardest nominee to confirm. She will be opposed by all Democrats of course. But most of the Republicans are also warmongering hawks. None of the other nominees, including Patel, have dared to question our foreign policy as openly as she has. Mumbling vaguely that we shouldn’t “get involved” in certain foreign conflicts is not the same thing as visiting Syria, saying Assad is not our enemy, and condemning our use of Islamist extremists as proxies against him. She will have her words thrown back in her face, forcing her to either dissemble with some sort of patriotic mush or stand by her words and admit “our government” was lying. What will she say about Assad now, for example? I think it may rather be what will Syria have to say about itself between now and any confirmation hearing. That is a two month window to find out what the uni-party has created and whether there will be calls for boots on the ground there, the responsibility to protect those helpless wheat fields and benign oil reserves. By the time of her confirmation hearings, Syria will be a Jihadist cesspool and nobody will have any appetite for putting boots on the ground. The repercussions of the fall of Syria will be plain to see and Gabbard will not be shy in pointing this out. Old Joe took the credit for Assad’s fall so now the consequences will be on the Democrats. By the time Gabbard hearings happen, our formerly cuddly Jihadis will be at war with Israel. (Heck, the way IDF is invading deep into Syria, it could start before the year is out.) That will cause some interesting contortions. For all we know, the shooter didn’t expect to survive. Perhaps he didn’t expect to survive, particularly given that he apparently suffers from severe chronic back pain. I had a friend who did himself in with pills and booze because of it. In any event, he’s become a cause celebre. Should he survive incarceration and not go the way of Epstein, his trial will be quite something. I wonder how deeply his defence will be allowed to explore and explain his motivation to a jury as a powerful mitigating circumstance, essentially putting the healthcare system on trial. I suppose jury nullification is a possibility but probably too much to hope for. I am sorry about your friend. I have (or had) a close relative who did the same at the age of 57. And now I too have the same back condition, though I avoid booze and pills. It really does put limitations on one’s life and a pall over one’s outlook. I can imagine it must be even more upsetting to a younger person — since you know will have to live with it that much longer. yeah. back problems are the worst. out of all my numerous broken bones and other sundry injuries to my skeleton, the 2 old, self-healed compression fractures in my back are the worst, by far. especially with cold fronts, hurricanes, etc. nothing you can do to get away from it. mine are likely from hauling feedsacks on one shoulder when i was much younger. nothing radicalisises you like constant pain, and an indifferent and uncaring healthcare system…but yer likely too frelled up to go all crazy like Luigi did. i sure as hell couldnt. my skeleton prevents travel. lucky for the aristocracy, i suppose. (yes, feeling murderous, tonight,lol….let lindsey graham or some other warmongering asshat wander in front of my truck tomorrow, and we’ll see…if i see them…in time.) Hannah Arendt noted that “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the dedicated communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction, true and false, no longer exists.” Two things on the accused Adjuster. First, while a rapid arrest was no doubt greatly wished by TPTB, I’m not sure the guy they got, regardless of guilt, is the one they wanted or needed. This is someone, who with family, can take this to a trial where a guilty verdict is highly unlikely and where the defense will air a lot of facts and figures our politicians and Big Health (Insurance, private health providers, health services and Big Pharma) really really do not want to get a lot of air play. And even having a friendly judge will not help them, because anything they deny for the defense will be being aired in public regardless. Second is just amusing, had a conversation with a NYC police officer today about how so much of the surveillance video I see really does not provide enough detail for people to really recognize people or cars, especially since the general NYC public uniform of black clothing becomes a black blob. They threw in that they didn’t understand why the Adjuster went to Altoona and didn’t just stay in NYC. Mostly because for all the surveillance it really isn’t as comprehensive and easy as we think and with so many people it is much easier to just blend in with the crowd. Maybe the Adjuster believes that the surveillance system in NYC is more all-powerful than the systems in other places. However, I notice that that NYC police officer either assumes that NYC Guy and Altoona Guy are the same guy, or he wants everyone hearing/reading his words to assume it. I for one do not assume it. So I have no way of knowing whether NYC Guy ever went to Altoona or not. Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. And it can leave lasting issues in maybe most patients that are worse than the original issue ever was. If we wanted to set the DOGE police on medicine, one of the easiest low-hanging fruits would be the abuse of back surgery. 35 years ago – the rule was – No back surgery unless the patient is paralyzed (or with a clear imminent impending paralysis) and there is possible hope of reversing that. THE END. Now there are surgeons doing “minimally invasive” procedures 10 times a day. It seldom works well. And it can be castastrophically tragic for many. This is ESPECIALLY true of the morbidly obese – they should lose weight. And the young jock types – they should be doing core work and extra training – not surgery. The problem with doing this on a young athlete is their life, their exercise and their ability to perform will never be the same. And this does not go well for so many of them. The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. We have a chronic pain problem here in the USA – we have completely out of control expectations and it leads to so many tragedies. Always remember – this one issue has been what I would call the “nexus” of the opioid epidemic. When these surgeries go bad – and they almost always do – the patient is left in varying degrees of horrific pain – ready to self-medicate or worse. And always remember – this type of surgery is a HUGE moneymaker for Big Hospital – there are entire hospitals across the land that do nothing but this. It is ripe for fraud – and this has played out among back surgeons going to jail all over this country. And never forget the story of Dr. Death. Again – I have no qualms about the DOGE dogs being unleashed on this. Something must be done. Thanks. One of my aunts had back surgery and everything you just said. I’m old enough to have arthritis, which runs in the family, and for awhile could barely walk due to swollen knees. Ever since I’ve tried to walk a couple of miles per day and don’t have any trouble at all with my legs. Of course younger people may not have the time to take walks. But perhaps you have to avoid the magic bullets as one gets older and go old school. IM Doc Re: above tweets about back pain surgery. I agree 100% – it is among the most overused and worthless procedures in all of a medicine. [ This is precisely what the chair of orthopedics at Harvard explained at a dinner. ] Forgive me for not be clearer. As I understood the chair of orthopedics, the problem was in using surgery for pain that could be and should rather be resolved by physical therapy or routine exercise. Much back pain can be resolved, I learned, by strengthening stomach muscles with bent-knee sit-ups. In college, there were a number of helpful exercises that wrestlers used for their backs, rowers as well and even for me as a runner. I was only repeating in summary dinner comments that stayed with me. I, for instance, as a runner, used bent-knee sit-ups for my back each day. Amen. “Core Strength” is key to a healthy life and old age; balanced back and front work that keep your body working normally. However, most people would rather die and be disabled than to arse themselves to work on this. Thankfully, my orthopedic Docs at Stanford, one for back, another for knees, are both strong proponents of physical therapy, reserving surgery as a last resort. Just to balance the narrative – I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer. I went from being unable to walk to being fine. For a pain free and full mobility quarter century, I am most grateful. The only lasting effect is a slight weakness on the side that had the pinched sciatic nerve, and that was much worse before the surgery. I do believe physical therapy after surgery helped in my case. Pretty much the same with me. Had a herniated disc and had to use a walker to get anywhere. The surgery was straightforward and recovery quick. However, I believe any fusion of back bones should be avoided. “I had back surgery 25 years ago and it was a life changer…” I much appreciate the balancing, and am pleased for you. A Doctor partially paralyzed my step grandpa after a back surgery gone wrong. He retired as a City Bud Driver and had chronic pain. Then why do the insurance companies approve these procedures? To sell profitable pain killers for years through their pharma subsidiary, at least that’s what United Healthcare does. How does back surgery mesh with the Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) cheer-leaders, or do profits put a thumb on the scale? (I’m still having problems wrapping my head around US-backed Jihadis promising Diversity and Democracy.) That’s only because you think they believe or mean those promises. If you decide to believe that they are being coached to say it for the cameras for the time being, then you won’t have problems wrapping your head around it. Remember the deathless words of Erdogan. ” I see that Democracy is like a bus. I get on it and ride till it gets me where I want to go. Then I get off.” I don’t believe in anything except the Kalama Sutta and I watch what the hands are doing. To paraphrase Sid Arthur from 2500 years or so ago, “Go kick a rock.” The physical therapy and extra exercise may take months – but it is so much better in the long run. Years, in my case. 12-24 months after starting I was still getting episodes, and things were better but not by all that much. It felt like I was making no progress. Somehow I kept at it and things did change (slowly) and today after >10 years I’m barely troubled by it any more. I know it’s still there – sometimes something sets it off – but it’s a minor niggle for a few days and doesn’t prevent me from doing anything I want to do or cause any serious discomfort. It used to wipe me out completely for weeks on end. I think what kept me going was noticing small improvements in things I hadn’t even realized were a problem. After 6-12 months I could stand for longer than an hour without needing to sit down. I hadn’t even realized that was abnormal. I realized that if I stopped, things would just keep getting worse. aye. guy who did my hip replacement actually warned me away from any back surgery to fix these compression fractures….and the big ortho outfit he worked for had that as a big part of their business model. and, please IMDoc, remember that not all of us long term opioid patients are junkies. the vicodin doesnt remove the pain, but it does mitigate it( i miss it when i miss a dose)…and when i do my every 2 or 3 year drug holiday to reset the receptors and start again at 5mg, i have had zero withdrawal symptoms. careful with big brushes,lol. Great post, thanks. Working hard to keep my back muscles strong enough to never develop chronic pain. And worried sick my 80-something friends are going down a similar road with the electrophysiologists, so very eager to implant devices in anyone with sometimes-erratic heartbeats. A lifesaver, sure, for some. A really nice money-maker for them? Also sure. It makes me leery. I am lucky that my back pain was managed by the VA, who had undertaken a whole new approach to pain management. No opiates and invasive procedures unless absolutely necessary. Wholistic approach which included education, physical therapy, “non-traditional” procedures like acupuncture, and very mild, non-opiate based painkillers as necessary. I did undergo ablasion, which certainly helped. The combination of all of these has kept me reasonably pain-free for five years now, with occasional flare-ups which I can manage using the knowledge gained from the pain-management classes, with massage, acupuncture and exercises. All in all, it has allowed me to remain active and go on long hikes with reasonable weight load. The question is, why don’t private insurers stimulate more hospital systems to go to that approach? I am reasonably certain that my care was both cheaper, monetarily and socialy, and more effective, than what’s being offered to the privately insured. Ernst is playing a role. Can’t have Thune, protégé of Turtle, get sullied with any pre-nomination discourse or controversy. Keep that powder, or those favors, for future matters. Meanwhile, Ernst gets some press visibility. Win-win for the Shell game and Turtle legacy protection. A question: Will NC take a closer look at Romania and the annulled election? It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal, if one takes the notion of free elections in the EU seriously. It is a de-facto Russiagate à la roumaine that has changed the outcome of a political process for real. That is quite something. Taibbi should be looking into this….(did he?) Romania is also interesting since it’s a textbook case of old and new elites realigning after ’89. The place never came to peace. Which is why people don’t take politics there seriously. It’s pretty tragic and ugly. “It is surprising how little media are reporting on what is a gigantic scandal…” Given the givens, I’m surprised that you’re surprised. The bit of MSM news I saw recently accentuated the dastardly deployment of Russian backed social media as being responsible for voters making an unacceptable choice. After the Moldovan President was re-elected based on the votes coming from the Moldovan diaspora and not those living in Moldova, it is no surprise. Ursula is centralizing as much power as she can in Brussels so I can see a day when it will be Brussels that will dictate the authenticity of an election held and maybe even who is allowed to stand for office. More of those “EU values” that we keep on hearing about. Well, they just canceled election because they lost, and the reason given is far more ridiculous than the original Russiagate. So I guess there is not much to talk about, if the Romanians themselves accept it without fight. Maybe that’s the actual message, that everyone sort of accepts EU is fixing election right and left, like nobody was making big fuss about the fairness of latest “election” in USSR. Don’t forget that Pres Yoon of SK claiming thst he ordered martial law as a measure against electoral fraud. Re: Don’t throw away your printed books […] I am eagerly awaiting my option to subscribe to NC in print! re: “Don’t throw away your printed books: I am divided on this. Do I really read F Scott Fitzgerald differently, do I process it differently when reading it as a printed book in contrast to reading it on an e-book reader? How deep does the scientific evidence reach here? Is it merely external phenoma that are measured? Or more substantial internal matters? How far can brain functions be identified with 100% certainty and connected with genuine different results? Is it due to the technology itself? Or due to the notion of multi-tasking? Which would have nothing to do with possible inferiority of the technology of reading on digital devices as such. I can’t comment about e-readers because I don’t own one, but my experience tells me that I undoubtedly process words better on paper than on screen. And by “process” I don’t necessarily mean high level deep emotional processing (prefrontal cortex, amygdala) but rather lower level visual processing (retina, thalamus). Reading nice serif fonts on paper affords me less eye strain and fatigue, which could indirectly allow me to better comprehend the content of the text I am reading. You ask some very tough questions about how we can even measure brain functions and how it relates to reading comprehension. I don’t have a good answers, but you can still reap benefits of not reading all day on screens. It’s like intuitively understanding that eating lots of un-manufactured and unprocessed vegetables is a great idea even if you don’t have a good understanding of how digestion affects health. NC’s favorite contributor, Michael Hudson, agrees in his most recent article on how publishing monopolies are squeezing writers. Hudson laments screens causing him eyestrain and the publishers insisting on using tiny print with ugly typefaces on the paper versions. As knowledgeable as Hudson is, he probably doesn’t have the clout to dictate the typography in his books. (Whose poor idea was it to not include an index in Killing The Host? I doubt it was Michael himself.) Edward Tufte certainly has the clout to tell publishers how to style and design his books. Take a look at Tufte’s books. They have the most beautiful graphic design and typography. (I believe Tufte commonly uses the Sabon font in his books.) Needless to say I grew up a printed book person. However I am asking the “devil’s advocate’s” questions because I lack some knowledge on this that you might have and others on NC. Meaning: the serious scientific scholarship on this. Those who’s jobs in publishing it is to read books for real were the first ones who – as my circle of friends is concerned – were all with the “digital revolution” simply for practical reasons. There are as you say all sorts of issues involved. My underlying question is indeed if it hade made a difference to me had I grown up with the same titles but not in print but well readable digital devices. A nice cruel experiment with twins growing up! As you and matt below point out, various needs make for various purchases. The most common I guess is print for reading and making notes (I at least cannot read and making notes on digital devices. It makes serious research impossible.) But the second purchase is the pdf to research studies which I already have worked through or for works that I have no time to check. (Admittedly a practice more often used due to commenting on blogs which is not a paid job after all. So at some point time is an issue.) But still the questions that you already pointed at for me (prefrontal cortex, amygdala /retina, thalamus) – are the ones of a normative magnitude. It’s like with mask mandates during Covid: Do masks not work because the virus slips through the material. Or do they not work because people are too lazy to use them properly or at all. From the scientific POV two completely different answers. But mixed in the public arena. As the quality of publishing goes – I believe so far Germany in this area is still a safehaven if you work with one of the Classic publishers and not some online outfit or self-publishing (which I would assume lacks the money). On the other hand I have encountered micro-trends where certain publishers fell for new trendy fonts which I found detestable. Thanks also for the Hudson link. US capitalism is full of surprises… my sister likes collecting printed books ‘in case something happens.’ and i agree it is nice to have paper books for power outages. but as a student, i am NOT about to purchase and lug around 5 massive textbooks all day. if you’re reading a book for fun, printed copies are nice. but for other reasons, they are not. or when it is wet. they are two technologies with different uses. sometimes you need a book but it’s expensive so all you have is a pirated pdf. also it’s easier to read in bed on your phone. instead of holding a flashlight under the sheets like i used to as a kid, i can simply read on the phone. I have to do log book entries for my work as an aircraft mechanic. Sometimes they are 500 to 1000 words. Filled with part numbers and manual references. I learned along time ago that I can’t proof read on the computer screen. I print it out and make corrections. Then print on sticky paper and paste in the book. re: Don’t Throw Away Your Printed Books Here is the link to the article, which at least on my screen, did not come through: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1747938X18300101 ‘Donald J.

No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allwed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.” But when he goes to trial, will the judge rule that inadmissible in court? Gotta watch those New York courts Why would it be inadmissible? Self-incrimination? But it was written before he was arrested. If it is admitted into court, then that brings the whole question of why he did what he did. Is that a can of worms that the courts want to open? The state of American healthcare? It would be safer to declare him insane and put him away and not go there. The big question is did Luigi actually write this. Commenters on Twitter are saying that it doesn’t read like his other posts online, like his GoodReads reviews. Also, I just can’t get my head around why someone who went to such lengths not to get caught and managed to escape NYC would then allow himself to get caught. At least turn yourself in to make the political statement. So much that seems unaccountable. Why did he stay ten whole days in New York? And in a hostel that requires in-person check-in and in which you’d be sharing a room with other guests? As for the final sentence, “I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty…” a kind of invitation to other adjustors? Mind you, no way on earth I would take up that invitation even if I can’t begrudge anyone who does. Sounds less Marxist than German Red Army Faction. But the gist is the same. The last couple of years made it difficult for people to further promote and believe in the idea of constructive grass-roots movements changing matters down to top. For some time now left groups had mostly abandonded force, violence, murder. Wonder how long that remains. Might we see more of this? I haven’t followed this closely as I usually don’t like murder stories. (However the sane political rationale makes it more interesting of course.) I wouldn’t be surprised if this event was instrumentalized as another pro-Dems story confirming the fears of violence under a Trump administration. Simply by Trump being there. Even without any proven affiliation. As of “the billionaire”-class won etc. re: “ Why did he stay ten whole days in New York?” He had theatre tickets? wanted to see the tree at Rockefeller Center? Skating in Central Park? The “Sienna” exhibit at the Met Museum (It’s very good)? “Frau Ohne Schatten” with Nina Stemme at the Met Opera ? (Also good). why does anybody stay in NYC for 10 days? Amazing that he had the time to gun anybody down. 😂 would make for a great comedy: “The man who wanted to be assassin. (But didn’t make it in time.)” Make life extremely uncomfortable for anyone who dares to oppose him. Which Obama and Biden never did or likely considered. Meanwhile Republicans fear their base and Trump exercises political power. That McDonald’s employee who rated out that guy may have to wait awhile for his reward – if he ever gets it that is- https://www.unilad.com/news/us-news/luigi-mangione-ceo-shooting-mcdonalds-worker-reward-333982-20241210 Too bad. He learned the hard way that the US is not agreement-capable. He should have been reading alt-media … next time call crime stoppers, and let the perp walk! About that ” don’t throw away your printed books” article . . . I wonder whether people who learned to do their high-level reading on printed text are able to comprehend text on screens just as well as if it were printed. The reason I don’t throw away my printed books is so that I will still have something printed if/when the entire Internet and the entire digisphere goes dark and stays dark for good. Interesting. But then we did once have to learn how to read paper books and for some of us that happened very early. So I think the point is that it’s really about what’s in the books and the technology is a sidebar. Personally I did have trouble adjusting to reading ebooks and found that making the screen presentation–sharpness, serif text, a preferred two page per screen format–as much like a real book was the way to go. For this reason the old e-ink Kindle was a pain. There are Bezos’ good ideas and–so many–Bezos’ bad ideas. Meanwhile computer displays are now very sharp indeed and the contrast is unbeatable. Now I have trouble reading paper books. Of course paper copies of books should be kept somewhere and we once thought and perhaps still think this is the public library’s job. But it seems they aren’t into being archivists Most libraries nowadays are actively landfilling books so they can build studios to teach the kids how to Tiktok. Because that is what the kids need to know. Too bad we don’t have a Carnegie to donate the money and dictate that the libraries should do something other than what the Propaganda Broadcasting System (PBS) tells them is relevant. “Anger at plan to turn Nazi tunnels into bunker for super-rich” Of course where Dachau is located would make a great site for rural-residential living in a new gated community and conveniently situated near Munich. Why yes, there will be guards but they will be for keeping people out, not like the previous ones that had the job of keeping people in. The MSM has been talking about how people need to switch to “secure” communications on their cell phones becasue of Chinese hacking, but apparently, it’s MUCH more serious than that.

The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a resounding defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But the Ukrainians and Americans should be reminded that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelenskyi not to negotiate with Russia, but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. Agreed. But Trump will need to cut Ukraine loose quickly. Otherwise it becomes his tar baby.

At least I wouldn´t know how. – Scott Horton Interview BERLINER ZEITUNG – “The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost” – Scott Horton in an interview The representatives of an aggressive US foreign policy bear a large share of the responsibility for the war in Ukraine, says the American author Scott Horton in an interview. The war in Ukraine is currently reaching a turning point. The Ukrainian army seems to have little left to oppose the Russian army. President Volodymyr Selenskyj has admitted that he will have to come to terms with ceding territory to Russia. Will there be peace negotiations under US President Donald Trump? The American radio presenter and publicist Scott Horton has examined the history of the war in his new book “Provoked. How Washington started the New Cold War with Russia and the catastrophe in Ukraine”. The Berliner Zeitung spoke to him about the long-term goals of the USA, the role of Angela Merkel and possible peace scenarios. Mr. Horton, the war in Ukraine has been raging for almost three years now. The USA is Kiev’s most important ally. What are the long-term goals of the American government in Ukraine? It’s complicated. Essentially, they want to integrate Ukraine into the so-called American security umbrella and install a government that is friendly to them. Russia has been pressured with NATO’s constant eastward expansion. Of course, Russia’s neighbors wanted American protection. But the problem is that it became a self-fulfilling prophecy when it comes to a country like Ukraine, which is of paramount importance to Russia. When the US declared that Ukraine should become a member of the Western security architecture, a threshold was crossed. The US has been playing out NATO membership for Ukraine since the 1990s. But the smartest members of the American leadership have always warned against it. Ukraine’s history and Russia’s history are deeply intertwined. Russia has a significant strategic interest in the Sevastopol naval base in Crimea. The American strategy of integrating Ukraine out of Russia’s sphere of interest and into the Western sphere of influence became a direct threat to Russia, provoking a reaction. Would you say that the American government underestimated Russia? The part of the American establishment that was counting on further western integration of Ukraine did not think that Russia would invade Ukraine. I recall the words of Senator Chris Murphy, who praised the US role in overthrowing the government on television after the so-called Maidan revolution of 2014. Murphy said: “We did a great job.” The moderator then asked whether this might not provoke a conflict with Russia. Murphy replied: “That would be crazy.” He assumed that Russia would not intervene. A few weeks later, Ukraine lost Crimea and the east of the country was at war. In her biography, former German Chancellor Angela Merkel defended the decision not to admit Ukraine into NATO at the 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest. What effect did Merkel’s decision have at the time? Well, the so-called hawks, who stand for an aggressive American foreign policy, argue that if Ukraine had been given far-reaching military commitments at the time, the war would not have started in the first place, because Putin would not have attacked any NATO member. I think the more plausible answer is that Russia would have immediately launched an invasion of Ukraine, even before the NATO treaties were signed. The then US President George W. Bush was warned. The American ambassador to Russia, William Burns, wrote a memorandum in February 2008, published by Wikileaks, entitled “Njet means Njet. Russia’s Nato Enlargement Redlines”. In it, Burns warned his boss, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, against bringing Ukraine and Georgia into NATO. It was not just about Putin. For the entire Russian security apparatus, this would have crossed a line. In his memoirs, Burns later reported an email to Rice in which he explained to her what a sensitive point the issue was for Russia. Merkel and French President François Hollande did everything they could to stop Bush. But Bush was determined. They agreed to a compromise not to guarantee Ukraine a NATO membership process, but only that Kiev would one day be given the prospect of a NATO membership process. Merkel’s stance against Bush was in line with the leadership of the American security services and the US State Department. So was it a far-sighted decision by the then German Chancellor? Merkel was deeply concerned about provoking Russia. She did not think about what economic costs Germany would face in the event of a military conflict. The only question was, why should she provoke Putin if Germany could not gain any benefits from it. While President Joe Biden has always been a strong military supporter of Ukraine, his successor Donald Trump has announced that he will stop military aid to Ukraine. Why do the Democrats in the US have a stronger interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I am not sure if that is the case. The political right accuses the Democrats of money laundering and shady dealings in Ukraine. I do not know anything specific about that. I think the scandal surrounding Joe Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who is said to have received bribes from Ukraine is not decisive. It starts earlier: Hunter Biden was installed at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings to protect the company’s owner, Mykola Zlochevskyj. Zlochevskyj was closely linked to the government of the fugitive President Viktor Yanukovych. That is why he sought protection from the Americans. Burisma hired Hunter Biden, as well as the former CIA officer Cofer Black and the former President of Poland, Aleksander Kwaśniewski. To return to your question: Do the Democrats have a greater strategic interest in Ukraine than the Republicans? I would put it this way: the bipartisan consensus in US foreign policy is absolutely in agreement with Joe Biden. The new right that supports Trump is against an interventionist US foreign policy. The Republican establishment, such as the Republican minority leader in the US Senate, Mitch McConnell, is fully in line with the aggressive US foreign policy of George W. Bush, John McCain and Joe Biden. Their main concern now is damage limitation. The USA suffered a devastating defeat in Ukraine. It is just like in Afghanistan and Vietnam. The USA financed the war for years and millions of people died. In the end, the Reds were in Saigon, and today the Taliban are back in power in Kabul. The USA has plunged Ukraine into terrible chaos. In order to effectively push Russia back, the USA would have to station its own soldiers in Ukraine. But the price of a nuclear escalation would be too high for that. The reality is: the east of Ukraine is lost. The willingness of the American public to continue supporting Ukraine in the fight against Russia is declining. Why do the majority of Americans no longer support the government of President Volodymyr Zelensky? Because it is obvious that we have been lied to. They said we will support Ukraine against Russia for as long as it takes. But it was supposed to take a year or two. The media often tell the joke: “Russia has the second strongest army in the world. But it looks more like they only have the second strongest army in Ukraine.” But now the war has been going on for three years, and the leading newspapers in the USA agree, and Zelensky is also aware, that Ukraine will have to give up territory. The American public is not so interested in what is happening in Donetsk Oblast. They are much more concerned about the fact that bridges are eroding in their own country and that their own government is abandoning them in the event of serious natural disasters. When Hurricane Helene devastated North Carolina in September, the U.S. Army could have provided assistance. There are several locations in the state. Where were the Blackhawk helicopters to rescue Americans from the floods? They were in Europe supporting NATO and on their way to the Middle East. As people in North Carolina were fighting for survival, President Biden announced that another billion-dollar package for Ukraine would be approved. This is a major point why the Democrats lost the presidential election. The war in Ukraine pushed the German economy into recession. Since then, Germany no longer imports cheap gas from Russia, but expensive LNG from the USA. Is this just a combination of unfortunate circumstances? The Germans are the collateral damage in America’s economic war against Russia. The aim was to prevent as many Russian gas exports to the West as possible and to drive Russia into national bankruptcy. But that is not working. Russia is now exporting its gas to the East. American geostrategists, such as George Friedmann from the think tank Stratfor, discuss it surprisingly openly that the absolute priority for the USA is to separate Russia from Germany. The function of NATO is to keep America in, Germany down and the Russians out, as the first NATO Secretary General Lord Ismay described it in 1949. An alliance between Germany, the industrial superpower, and Russia, the resource superpower, would dominate Eastern Europe and destroy the influence of the Americans and British in the region. It is no coincidence that Senator Ted Cruz from my home state of Texas was a staunch opponent of the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 pipeline during the Trump and Biden years. Texas produces much of the American LNG that the US profitably supplies to Germany. Victoria Nuland, the former European representative at the US State Department, said to Cruz: “Well, Senator, what you always wanted has happened: Nord Stream 2 is a lump of metal on the seabed.” The Ukrainian president is increasingly losing support among the population. Do you think he will be able to hold on if Ukraine continues to go on the defensive? Zelenskyy has strengthened his power by suspending the presidential election and imposing martial law. It will depend on whether there will be powerful challengers who can offer an alternative. It also depends on which part of the population you ask. The further west you go, the more often you get the answer that the fight against Russia should continue. If you go to the east of the country, you are told to rely on negotiations. A serious problem is that neo-Nazis are gaining strong influence in Ukraine. Dmytro Yarosh and Andrei Biletsky have threatened Zelensky and his predecessor Petro Poroshenko with death. New York Times journalist Andrew Kramer has reported in detail on the danger posed by these people. They are actual descendants of Hitler’s collaborators in Ukraine who fought in World War II. They do not want to accept a ceasefire. For them, it would be a betrayal of the many soldiers who died in the war. They do not want to give up until they have won. If Zelensky starts peace negotiations, he will be in serious danger in the country. So, how will things turn out in Ukraine: Will we see peace in the next few weeks? I fear that the situation in Ukraine is so difficult that Trump will have a hard time making a deal. The best thing he can do is withdraw as quickly as possible. Just like they did in Afghanistan. It would be a crushing defeat and the Democrats would be furious. But it is worth reminding Ukrainians and Americans that it was Joe Biden who made them false promises. He knew that Ukraine could not defeat Russia. He told Zelensky not to negotiate with Russia but to launch spring, summer and fall offensives, all of which failed. But there are still some doubts as to whether Trump is even seeking peace with Russia. After all, he has chosen many hawks for his government team. And he is in no position to make any demands on Moscow. Given the current military situation, Putin can draw the border pretty much wherever he wants. The question is whether he will expand to Kharkiv and Odessa, or whether he will just annex the oblasts he already controls. The optimistic scenario would be an agreement that freezes the conflict and draws the border where it currently is. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Pixtral 12B is now available on Amazon SageMaker JumpStart
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/pixtral-12b-is-now-available-on-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/
Time Published: 2024-12-10T18:21:22Z
Full Content:
Today, we are excited to announce that Pixtral 12B (pixtral-12b-2409), a state-of-the-art vision language model (VLM) from Mistral AI that excels in both text-only and multimodal tasks, is available for customers through Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. You can try this model with SageMaker JumpStart, a machine learning (ML) hub that provides access to algorithms and models that can be deployed with one click for running inference. In this post, we walk through how to discover, deploy, and use the Pixtral 12B model for a variety of real-world vision use cases. Pixtral 12B represents Mistral’s first VLM and demonstrates strong performance across various benchmarks, outperforming other open models and matching larger models, according to Mistral. Pixtral is trained to understand both images and documents, and shows strong abilities in vision tasks such as chart and figure understanding, document question answering, multimodal reasoning, and instruction following, some of which we demonstrate later in this post with examples. Pixtral 12B is able to ingest images at their natural resolution and aspect ratio. Unlike other open source models, Pixtral doesn’t compromise on text benchmark performance, such as instruction following, coding, and math, to excel in multimodal tasks. Mistral designed a novel architecture for Pixtral 12B to optimize for both speed and performance. The model has two components: a 400-million-parameter vision encoder, which tokenizes images, and a 12-billion-parameter multimodal transformer decoder, which predicts the next text token given a sequence of text and images. The vision encoder was newly trained that natively supports variable image sizes, which allows Pixtral to be used to accurately understand complex diagrams, charts, and documents in high resolution, and provides fast inference speeds on small images like icons, clipart, and equations. This architecture allows Pixtral to process any number of images with arbitrary sizes in its large context window of 128,000 tokens. License agreements are a critical decision factor when using open-weights models. Similar to other Mistral models, such as Mistral 7B, Mixtral 8x7B, Mixtral 8x22B and Mistral Nemo 12B, Pixtral 12B is released under the commercially permissive Apache 2.0, providing enterprise and startup customers with a high-performing VLM option to build complex multimodal applications. SageMaker JumpStart offers access to a broad selection of publicly available foundation models (FMs). These pre-trained models serve as powerful starting points that can be deeply customized to address specific use cases. You can now use state-of-the-art model architectures, such as language models, computer vision models, and more, without having to build them from scratch. With SageMaker JumpStart, you can deploy models in a secure environment. The models can be provisioned on dedicated SageMaker Inference instances, including AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia powered instances, and are isolated within your virtual private cloud (VPC). This enforces data security and compliance, because the models operate under your own VPC controls, rather than in a shared public environment. After deploying an FM, you can further customize and fine-tune the model, including SageMaker Inference for deploying models and container logs for improved observability.With SageMaker, you can streamline the entire model deployment process. Note that fine-tuning on Pixtral 12B is not yet available (at the time of writing) on SageMaker JumpStart. To try out Pixtral 12B in SageMaker JumpStart, you need the following prerequisites: You can access Pixtral 12B through SageMaker JumpStart in the SageMaker Studio UI and the SageMaker Python SDK. In this section, we go over how to discover the models in SageMaker Studio. SageMaker Studio is an IDE that provides a single web-based visual interface where you can access purpose-built tools to perform ML development steps, from preparing data to building, training, and deploying your ML models. For more details on how to get started and set up SageMaker Studio, refer to Amazon SageMaker Studio Classic. Deployment starts when you choose Deploy. When deployment is complete, an endpoint is created. You can test the endpoint by passing a sample inference request payload or by selecting the testing option using the SDK. When you use the SDK, you will see example code that you can use in the notebook editor of your choice in SageMaker Studio. To deploy using the SDK, we start by selecting the Mistral Nemo Base model, specified by the model_id with the value huggingface-vlm-mistral-pixtral-12b-2409. You can deploy your choice of any of the selected models on SageMaker with the following code: This deploys the model on SageMaker with default configurations, including the default instance type and default VPC configurations. You can change these configurations by specifying non-default values in JumpStartModel. The end-user license agreement (EULA) value must be explicitly defined as True in order to accept the EULA. Also, make sure that you have the account-level service limit for using ml.p4d.24xlarge or ml.pde.24xlarge for endpoint usage as one or more instances. To request a service quota increase, refer to AWS service quotas. After you deploy the model, you can run inference against the deployed endpoint through the SageMaker predictor. In this section, we provide examples of inference on Pixtral 12B with example prompts. We use the following image as input for OCR. We use the following prompt: For chart understanding and analysis, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: We get the following output: For an image-to-code example, we use the following image as input. We use the following prompt: After you are done, delete the SageMaker endpoints using the following code to avoid incurring unnecessary costs: In this post, we showed you how to get started with Mistral’s newest multi-modal model, Pixtral 12B, in SageMaker JumpStart and deploy the model for inference. We also explored how SageMaker JumpStart empowers data scientists and ML engineers to discover, access, and deploy a wide range of pre-trained FMs for inference, including other Mistral AI models, such as Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x22B. For more information about SageMaker JumpStart, refer to Train, deploy, and evaluate pretrained models with SageMaker JumpStart and Getting started with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart to get started.

The stock's worst day of 2024 had been a 5.4% decline in May. The shares are still up about 69% for the year, which would be the best annual performance since the dot-com boom of 1999. After the close Monday, Oracle reported adjusted earnings per share for the fiscal second quarter of $1.47, trailing analysts' average estimate by a penny, according to LSEG. Revenue rose 9% from a year earlier to $14.06 billion, missing the $14.1 billion average estimate. Net income increased 26% to $3.15 billion, or $1.10 a share, from $2.5 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in Oracle's cloud services business jumped 12% from a year earlier to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue. "A bit of a stumble here for a stock that's created some lofty expectations for itself," wrote analysts at KeyBank Capital Markets in a note after the report on Monday. They still recommend buying the stock and said "we still like oracle heading into 2025." For the current quarter, Oracle expects revenue growth of 7% to 9%. At the midpoint of that range, revenue would be about $14.3 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $14.65 billion, according to LSEG. The company said it expects adjusted earnings of $1.50 to $1.54 per share. Analysts were calling for earnings per share of $1.57. Oracle's biggest growth engine has been cloud infrastructure, where it is competing with Amazon, Microsoft and Google as businesses move workloads out of their own data centers. The business is booming due to soaring demand for computing power that can handle artificial intelligence projects. Oracle said revenue in its cloud infrastructure unit surged 52% from a year earlier to $2.4 billion.Oracle said it just signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media company to use its infrastructure to help with various projects related to the Llama family of large language models. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Oracle founder Larry Ellison said in a statement. Analysts at Piper Sandler raised their price target on the stock to $210 from $185 "based on continued cloud momentum." They cited Oracle's cRPO (current remaining performance obligations) growth of 20%. That figures points to contracted revenue that has yet to be booked.

Larry Ellison, Oracle’s billionaire co-founder, had his net worth cut by $15 billion Tuesday as the company’s stock paced its worst loss in nearly a year, after a recent earnings report that fell short of estimates, though analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm. Analysts remained optimistic about the database software firm despite a recent earnings report. Oracle’s shares fell by more than 7% to below $177 as of around 11:40 a.m. EST, the biggest plunge for the stock since Dec. 12, 2023. The value of Ellison’s roughly 42% stake in Oracle—totaling more than 1.1 billion shares—decreased from $218.2 billion at Monday’s close to $203 billion Tuesday. On Monday, Oracle reported $14.06 billion in second-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $1.47, both of which fell just below analyst projections of $14.1 billion and $1.48 per share, respectively, according to FactSet. Despite missing estimates, analysts indicated Oracle’s cloud business will likely fuel its growth: Of the 38 analysts surveyed by FactSet, none lowered their stock price target for Oracle and 14 raised their projections, including some that have the stock returning close to its record intraday high of $198 set on Monday. Revenue from Oracle’s cloud services rose 12% year-over-year to $10.81 billion, accounting for 77% of total revenue, the company said. Investment firm D.A. Davidson said in a note Tuesday that Oracles’ cloud infrastructure “remains heightened” as demand for AI-based computing continues to grow.

Ellison is the world’s third-richest person with an estimated net worth of $220 billion, which decreased by about 6% on Tuesday. Oracle’s chairman ranks behind Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, currently the second-wealthiest in the world, though the two have traded ranks multiple times in recent months. Bezos’ fortune increased by nearly 1% ($2.4 billion) to $242.3 billion Tuesday as Amazon shares rose slightly. 83%. That’s how much Oracle’s shares increased this year as of Monday’s share price of $190.45. Oracle, a database software firm co-founded by Ellison, has succeeded this year alongside a rising demand for AI-based technology. Earlier this year, Deutsche Bank analysts said Oracle achieved a “triple crown” after reaching partnerships with cloud computing giants Google, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. Oracle also recently signed an agreement with Meta, allowing the social media firm to use Oracle’s cloud infrastructure to help with projects related to Meta’s Llama language models. Oracle raised its guidance for its 2026 fiscal year in September, saying the company expects to generate about $66 billion in revenue shortly after announcing the company would take orders for “computing clusters” built with Nvidia’s GPUS. The product was touted by Oracle as the “largest AI supercomputer in the cloud.” One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

GERMANY - 2024/12/01: In this photo illustration, a Meta Platforms Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... [+] monitor. (Photo Illustration by Valera Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) META Platforms stock (NASDAQ: META) is up 5% in a month, with investor optimism around the TikTok ban. A federal appeals court recently upheld a law requiring TikTok’s owner ByteDance to find a new owner for its U.S. operations, outside of China, by January 19, 2025, or face a ban. If TikTok were to be banned in the U.S., it would have been a positive for Meta, with less competition in the social media space. See how two other tech stocks compare in Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock. Even if we were to look at a slightly longer term, META stock has outperformed, with 83% returns since early 2022 — rising from levels of $335 then to around $620 now — vs. an increase of 28% for the broader S&P 500 index over this period. This 83% growth can be attributed to: Let’s dive deeper into these factors. Separately, check out our take on EBAY – Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY? Meta Platforms is the world’s most popular social network that helps people connect with family and friends. The company makes money primarily through advertising, which it provides to advertisers by targeting specific demographics based on information posted by users on its platforms. Meta Platforms’ revenue has risen 32.5% from $118 billion in 2021 to $156 billion for the last twelve month period. This can be attributed to rising ad impressions as well as an increase in the average price per ad. Also, Meta’s family daily active people have risen 17% from 2.82 billion in 2021 to 3.29 billion now. Most of the company’s revenue comes from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only has the company’s sales risen in the last three years, its net income margin has expanded from 33.4% in 2021 to 35.6% now. Meta’s shares outstanding also declined by 8% over this period, thanks to the $122 billion the company spent on share repurchases. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion and fewer shares resulted in the company’s bottom line of $21.17 now, up 54% from $13.77 in 2021. Investors have rewarded Meta stock lately, as the rise in both ad impressions and average price per ad bodes well for the company’s sales. Furthermore, the company’s AI push is expected to help it generate higher advertising revenues, with an increase in user engagement and more effective targeting. Furthermore, what may go well for Meta is the TikTok ban in the U.S. But, ByteDance has recently filed an emergency motion with an appeals court seeking a temporary block on the ban from taking effect. [1] Meta stock declined nearly 2% after the news report of TikTok filing an emergency motion emerged. At its current levels of $615, META stock is up a solid 74% this year. However, the increase in META stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could META face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think META is fully valued now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, slightly below the current market price. META stock is now trading at 29x trailing earnings of $21.17 per share. This compares with the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. Although a slight rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately, investors should take into account the risks. It’s still unclear how significant a boost AI can be for the company’s earnings growth, which makes the continued aggressive investments in AI a slight risk. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta Platform’s peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Lisa Su

Time Published: 2024-12-10T14:02:00Z

Lisa Su apologizes if she seems tired. It’s the day after the U.S. presidential election, and like much of the nation she was awake until the early hours, transfixed as the results came in, only tearing herself away once it became clear that Donald Trump had won. “I wanted to know,” Su explains as she takes her place at the head of a conference table in the Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). “It’s relevant information.” The identity of the next President is pertinent news to most of America’s CEOs, but few more so than the leader of a top semiconductor company. Semiconductors, or chips, are the engines of our computers, phones, cars, internet services, and—increasingly—our artificial intelligence (AI) programs. The relentless rise of the chip over the past seven decades has grown economies, transformed lives, and helped cement the U.S., where most chips get their start, as the globe’s postwar hegemon. AMD is one of the world’s leading designers of the CPU chips that power both personal computers and data centers, the vast warehouses of servers that make possible the likes of Google, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft. It’s also a top designer of graphics processing units, or GPUs, the specialized chips used to create and run AI programs like ChatGPT. When you send an email, stream a movie, buy something online, or chat with an AI assistant, chances are an AMD chip is providing some of the computing power needed to make that happen. In November, a supercomputer that runs on AMD chips displaced another AMD-based machine to become the world’s most powerful. Which is thanks in large part to Su’s leadership. When she became CEO a decade ago, AMD stock was languishing around $3, its share of the data-center chip market had fallen so far that executives rounded it down to zero, and the question on everybody’s lips was how long the company had left. An engineer by training, Su spearheaded a bottom-up redesign of AMD’s products, ­repaired ­relationships with customers, and rode the AI boom to new heights. In 2022 the company’s overall value surpassed its historical rival ­Intel’s for the first time. AMD stock now trades at around $140, a nearly 50-fold increase since Su took over. This fall, Harvard Business School began teaching Su’s stewardship of AMD as a case study. “It really is one of the great turnaround stories of modern American business history,” says Chris Miller, a historian of the semiconductor industry and the author of Chip War. Purchase prints of this issue's covers here in the TIME Cover Store and click here to buy your copy of the Person of the Year issue For all its progress, AMD remains the semiconductor industry’s distant No. 2. As Su’s team was speeding past Intel, both companies were lapped by Nvidia, run by Su’s cousin Jensen Huang, which in two years has risen from industry also-ran to become the most valuable company in the world. Nvidia got a jump on its rivals by realizing that its chips, initially made for rendering graphics, happened to be perfectly suited for training neural networks, the programs that underpin modern AI. Of the $32 billion worth of AI data-center GPUs sold in the third quarter of 2024, ­Nvidia’s accounted for some 95%. In November, AMD announced that it would lay off 4% of its global workforce in what it framed as a restructuring to focus on the opportunities from AI. Meanwhile, big tech customers, like Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon, are now designing their own specialized chips for AI workloads, which could reduce their reliance on AMD products. And AMD’s continued growth relies on a host of factors outside its control: continued progress in AI; the security of Taiwan, where the vast majority of its top chips are manufactured; and the actions of a notoriously unpredictable U.S. President. Trump’s return to the White House will bring new turbulence to an industry that has barely caught its breath from a half-­decade of geopolitical showdowns, shortages, and an AI-fueled market boom. A lot rides on Su’s ability to steer the company through these obstacles. People who know her describe Su as a shrewd strategist who invests in talented people and jettisons those who aren’t pulling their weight. “I don’t believe leaders are born. I believe leaders are trained,” she tells TIME, ahead of a strategy meeting where she delivers blunt feedback to her executives and urges them to move faster and delegate more. Su, 55, holds meetings on weekends and is known among her executives for wanting to talk on morning calls about the finer points of long documents that were circulated after midnight. When prototype chips get delivered from the factory, she often personally goes down to the lab to help scrutinize them. It’s a hard-­charging style that isn’t for everyone and makes it difficult for people who don’t meet their commitments to survive at the company, according to Patrick Moorhead, a tech-industry analyst and a former AMD ­executive who left before she joined. The potential for artificial intelligence to transform science, health care, and the world of work hinges on access to a diverse supply of chips. In the brewing cold war between the U.S. and China, semiconductors are among the most vital battlegrounds. And America’s economic success—as measured by its stock market, at least—depends now more than ever on the continued growth of companies that design, produce, and utilize chips. Allies say Su is up to the task. “We couldn’t have a person better qualified for this job,” says Jerry Sanders, the company’s 88-year-old founder and its first CEO. Does she have what it takes to beat Nvidia one day? “Not a question in my mind,” he says. In October 2014, Forrest Norrod was sitting in his car at a McDonald’s drive-­through when he got a phone call from Su. Norrod had just quit his job as an executive at Dell, intending to take some time off. Su wanted to pitch him on joining AMD, where she had just been appointed CEO. While Norrod waited for his Quarter Pounder with cheese, he listened to her vision for the struggling company. By the next day, he was at AMD’s Austin headquarters, weighing the opportunity to lead its server business. Norrod had seen how the pace of innovation in the cloud-­chip industry had dropped off once AMD had allowed Intel to dominate the market, and believed that customers were paying the price. He got a sense that Su was a leader with a rare combination of traits: a technical background, business acumen, and people skills. He accepted the job. Su was born in Taiwan and moved to the U.S. at age 3, when the family immigrated so her father could attend graduate school. She grew up in New York City and discovered a love of STEM subjects at an early age, growing fascinated by the ability to write rudimentary programs on her Commodore 64 computer. She fondly recalls creating, at the science-­focused high school she attended in the Bronx, a project in which she simulated a hurricane inside a box, complete with boiling water and windows through which to watch the maelstrom. She chose to major in electrical engineering at MIT after determining that it was the most difficult option—and eventually earned her Ph.D. in the subject. It was at MIT that Su first experienced a semiconductor lab, where she was taken by the idea that such a tiny piece of hardware could carry so much mathematical firepower. She spent the first years of her career at Texas Instruments and IBM, two first-wave tech titans, which taught her about how to run a business and manage teams. “I was really lucky early in my career,” she says. “Every two years, I did a different thing.” She accepted a VP job at AMD in 2012, and by 2014 had ­ascended to CEO. “I felt like I was in training for the opportunity to do something meaningful in the semiconductor industry,” she says. “And AMD was my shot.” Su took over an indebted firm that had fired 25% of its staff, sold and leased back its Austin office, and spun off its expensive chip factories. It was a moment of change for the tech industry writ large. Smartphones and tablets were ascendant. Consumer PCs, AMD’s main market, were in decline. “It didn’t look at the time that Lisa was ­really set up for success,” says Stacy Rasgon, a chip-­industry analyst. “She was handed a tough situation.” Su’s turnaround plan had three steps: build great products, focus on customer relationships, and simplify the business. Some AMD board members wanted to pivot toward making low-power processors for phones. Su rejected that approach. “We needed to bet on what we were good at,” she says. What AMD was good at was building ­powerful processors. Su set a goal for her engineers: to build a new CPU chip that was 40% faster than the previous generation’s. And she started a team on an even more ambitious project: to explore how to develop a chip for the world’s first exascale super­computer, a machine capable of carrying out 1 quintillion operations per second. The decisions revealed a core tenet of Su’s leadership philosophy. “People are really motivated by ambitious goals,” she says. “The previous strategy of, hey, let’s just do a little bit better here and there—that’s actually less motivational.” The problem was that Su’s plans would take years to come to fruition. In the meantime, AMD was still on the ropes. “My job as a CEO was to give the engineers time to do the work,” Su says. She inked deals with console manufacturers that won AMD the revenue it needed to keep afloat. In 2016, she signed another with a consortium of ­Chinese companies, licensing some of AMD’s ­designs so they could make processors for the Chinese market. That deal brought in $293 million, though it would later come back to haunt AMD. By 2017, the company was on stronger financial footing and the new flagship chip was finally ready. Engineers had redesigned the CPU from the ground up, making use of a new architecture, which the company called “chiplets.” Until then, the chip industry had mainly etched the different parts of a processor onto one piece of silicon. AMD’s innovation was to put different circuits onto individual pieces of silicon and then fuse them all together, which made manufacturing more reliable and scalable. Engineers suggested to Su that they call the new chip “Zen,” because it was designed with a balance in mind between energy efficiency and high performance. The name stuck. Meanwhile, Intel, AMD’s main competitor, was beginning to flounder. Its new cloud processors were beset by delays. When AMD’s chips hit the market, they were the best on the block. With each new generation of Zen, AMD’s share of the cloud-­CPU market grew. Today, its share of that market is 34%. When AMD’s overall valuation surpassed Intel’s in 2022, “it felt fantastic,” Norrod says. “It’s something that I don’t think anybody in the industry would have believed was possible just a few years ago.” One recent afternoon at AMD’s Santa Clara headquarters, Su was sitting with several senior executives in the CEO’s favorite corner conference room, where the offices of both Nvidia and Intel are visible through the glass. In the meeting, Su pressed her colleagues to meet engineering milestones for the specialized chips that AMD sells for use in AI data centers. “We cannot miss a beat,” Su told them. “We have negative slack. Whatever we do organizationally, we cannot slow down.” AMD is grappling with geopolitical challenges that could reshape the semiconductor industry. Today’s chips have billions of transistors, tiny gates for managing electric current. To manufacture them requires colossal machines with hundreds of thousands of specialized parts, which fire lasers at tiny droplets of molten tin to create extreme ultra­violet light that bounces through a series of multilayered mirrors and, ultimately, etches designs onto thin wafers of silicon with atomic-level accuracy. A stray particle in the machine, a half-degree fluctuation in temperature, or a nanometer-­scale vibration could each threaten a batch of chips worth millions of dollars. The process is so complex, fragile, and expensive that only one company is currently able to manufacture at scale the most cutting-edge chips designed by the likes of AMD and Nvidia: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. The industry’s most advanced chips may be conceived in Silicon Valley, but their fabrication is almost entirely outsourced to just a handful of factories on the west coast of Taiwan. Some 80 miles across the Taiwan Strait lies China, which claims the self-­governing island as its territory. Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027, according to U.S. intelligence assessments made public last year. And Xi has set China on a path to reduce its technological dependence on the U.S. by producing powerful chips of its own. Without Taiwanese manufacturing, the semiconductor industry would be upended and the world’s supply of advanced chips would plummet. And if Beijing's effort to become a world-leading semiconductor producer is successful, it would set up China's military and AI industry to match or outpace America’s, which many in Washington view as a national-­security threat. In this light, Su’s 2016 decision to go into business with Chinese state-backed companies looks like a misstep. Pentagon officials tried and failed to block the deal at the time, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, which cited worries that AMD had transferred crucial know-how that could aid China’s military and domestic semiconductor ambitions. AMD denied suggestions that it had sought to evade regulatory scrutiny on the deal, saying that it had correctly briefed the Pentagon and other agencies and had received no objections, and that the Journal’s story contained “several factual errors and omissions.” At the time, there were few laws against technology transfer to China, and deeper economic integration between the two powers was viewed by many as natural. “It was a very different era,” Su says. But the music would quickly change. In 2019, the Trump Administration placed AMD’s Chinese joint venture on the “entity list” that restricts exports of critical ­technologies to foreign ­adversaries because of perceived ­security risks. In 2022, the Biden Administration passed broader export controls that made it illegal for companies like AMD and Nvidia to sell their most advanced chips to Chinese companies. Demand for specialized AI chips is so high, and their supply so constrained, that these export controls have so far had little effect on chipmakers’ bottom lines. But Trump is expected to further expand tariffs and sanctions on China, which could quickly become painful for chip companies. Some 15% of AMD’s revenue in 2023—$3.4 billion—came from the legal sale of less powerful chips to China and Hong Kong. AMD warned investors in October that its business could be adversely affected by tariffs, as well as any retaliatory measures imposed by foreign governments. If it’s any consolation for AMD’s market position, its rivals are even more exposed: in 2023, China and Hong Kong accounted for 17% of Nvidia’s revenue, and China represented 27% of Intel’s. “We want to service the entire world with our chips,” Su says. “[But] I’m certainly a believer in: we want to be the most advanced semiconductor country.” Still, AMD is incentivized to lobby against the widening of chip export controls, even if officials determine that more sanctions would be in the interests of national security. The Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group of U.S. chip companies including AMD, argues against export controls, and has spent more than $4.5 million since 2022 lobbying lawmakers in Washington, according to the watchdog OpenSecrets. “You have to run faster,” Su says of her view of the U.S.’s competition with China. She says her main goal with any lobbying is to help lawmakers make sure “that any desired policy has the desired effect,” adding, “We certainly want to be a good corporate citizen.” Inside a high-security laboratory beyond the dry hills at Silicon Valley’s ­eastern edge, a team of government scientists celebrated a major milestone in November. The machine under their care, housed in a room longer than a football field, had just achieved the official title of most powerful supercomputer in the world. If every single person on earth were to make one calculation per second, it would take them over 480 years to calculate what this supercomputer could in one minute. The machine is called El Capitan, after the massive granite rock formation in Yosemite National Park. At its heart are more than 44,000 AMD chips called accelerated processing units (APUs), which combine elements of CPUs and GPUs in the same chip. When Su heard the news that El Capitan had officially become the most powerful supercomputer in the world, she was ecstatic. “These are the days I live for,” she says. The achievement meant that the two most powerful supercomputers in the world are now powered by AMD chips. For Su, the win was about more than just bragging rights. “I personally visited the labs several times,” she says. Fulfilling her pledge to create best-in-class technology became almost an obsession, just as delivering Zen chips on time to waiting customers had been years earlier. “She’s so, so customer-centric,” says Vamsi Boppana, AMD’s senior vice president for AI. “She absolutely wants to delight, and that has served the company so well.” Su views supercomputing as the wellspring from which further AI profits will flow. The chips in El Capitan are “without a doubt, the most complex thing we’ve ever built,” she says. But they were not a single-purpose ­investment. The designs that AMD engineers used for El Capitan are already trickling down into the specialized AI chips supplied to clients like Meta and Micro­soft. The most advanced AMD chip currently on sale in the AI market, called the Instinct MI300X, is the “first cousin” of the chips inside El Capitan, says Mark ­Papermaster, AMD’s chief technology officer. That’s thanks to their chiplet-based designs, which make it relatively simple to switch in and out different components. “There is so much synergy between traditional high-­performance supercomputing and AI,” Su says. AMD always had a business in building GPUs for gaming, but after the release of ­ChatGPT in 2022, the company quickly spun up a more powerful line aimed at the data-center market. And in the past year, AMD’s projected revenue from specialized AI chip sales has leaped from essentially $0 to $5 billion, which would account for roughly 5% of that market. (Nvidia maintains a hammerlock on most of the rest.) This line of chips is now a popular choice for what’s known in the industry as AI “inference,” or the running of an already-formed AI system. For years, the easiest way to increase AI performance was by simply training bigger models on more GPU chips. But as some computer scientists report diminishing returns from that practice, companies are now turning to a different strategy: increasing the time AIs spend running ­instead—in the inference phase, rather than the training phase. That could be good news for AMD, whose inference chips are approaching parity with Nvidia’s in terms of not only speed but also energy efficiency, which matters even more when you’re running an AI over a longer period. “We do see inference as a growing piece of the market,” says Boppana. AMD is still struggling to break into the training phase of the market. That’s largely because Nvidia controls the world’s leading software for optimizing GPUs for that ­purpose—and it only works with Nvidia chips. The huge number of developers who already use it gives Nvidia an ongoing advantage. AMD is building its own competing software, but it is “absolutely behind Nvidia’s,” says Moorhead, the former AMD executive. Su says AMD is catching up. That’s partly thanks to an informal alliance with tech companies, including Meta, that want to avoid handing Nvidia an outright monopoly. Meta is buying AMD chips, contributing to AMD’s code base, and using its software in its data centers. “It’s a very good symbiotic relationship,” says Moorhead. “Without AMD, Nvidia can double their prices.” Says Su: “Nobody wants to be locked into a proprietary ecosystem. Really our strategy is: let’s invest in an open ecosystem. And then may the best chip win.” Yet in their bid to reduce their reliance on Nvidia, major AI companies have also begun to design some of their own chips in-house. That could threaten AMD in the long term. But Su doesn’t see it that way. “I actually see it as an opportunity,” she says. No company wants to replicate the $6 billion AMD pours into R&D annually, she argues. She sees instead a future where big tech companies continue to spend on AMD’s chips, while also relying on their own chips for certain workloads. “There’s no one-size-fits-all in computing,” she says. “The broader the ecosystem, the bigger the party.” If Su is right, the size of the party is going to keep on growing. She predicts the specialized AI chip market alone will grow to be worth $500 billion by 2028—more than the size of the entire semiconductor industry a decade ago. To be the No. 2 company in that market would still make AMD a behemoth. Sure, AMD won’t be overtaking Nvidia anytime soon. But Su measures her plans in decades. “When you invest in a new area, it is a five- to 10-year arc to really build out all of the various pieces,” she says. “The thing about our business is, everything takes time.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Simmone Shah Write to Billy Perrigo at billy.perrigo@time.com

Title: What will the year 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

U.S. stock futures are little changed after markets stepped back from record highs on tech sector jitters; GameStop (GME) reports earnings after markets close today; Oracle (ORCL) shares drop as the tech firm’s revenue comes in lower than expected; European regulators reportedly are seeking information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google on its advertising program targeting teens on Meta Platforms' (META) Instagram; and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posts strong November sales, showing that AI demand remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes began the week on a down note, due in part to weakness in the tech sector. Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are ticking higher, while Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are pointing marginally lower. Investors are preparing to digest more earnings reports today and watching for inflation data later this week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is slightly lower at around $97,000, while gold futures are 0.6% higher. Oil futures are 0.5% lower and yields on the 10-year Treasury note are slightly higher at above 4.2%. GameStop (GME) shares are edging lower in premarket trading ahead of the video game retailer's third-quarter earnings report after markets close today. The report comes after the stock briefly surged last week after a cryptic social media post by meme-stock hero Keith "Roaring Kitty" Gill evidently inspired some investors to buy in. GameStop stock is not widely followed by Wall Street analysts, with the one analyst tracked by Visible Alpha giving it an "underperform" rating and $10 price target, well below the $27.93 price shares closed at on Monday. Oracle (ORCL) stock is sinking 6% in premarket trading after the tech firm reported quarterly revenue that missed analysts' expectations. The cloud services giant, whose shares hit record highs last week on enthusiasm over artificial intelligence (AI) demand, reported revenue of $14.06 billion, up 9% year-over-year but below Visible Alpha estimates. Net income of $3.15 billion or $1.10 per share, up from $2.5 billion or 89 cents per share a year earlier, beat estimates. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 slightly missed expectations. European regulators are seeking more information from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google about the secret advertising partnership the search giant had with Instagram parent Meta Platforms (META), the Financial Times reported. The deal, which has since been ended, targeted Instagram advertisements to teenagers on YouTube, circumventing Google's rules barring personalized ads to those under 18. Shares of both Alphabet and Meta Platforms are higher in premarket trading. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM) posted a 34% year-over-year jump in November sales, a signal that demand for AI-focused chips remains strong for the Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) supplier. The company reported November sales of 276.06 billion New Taiwan dollars ($8.48 billion), down 12% from October's figures, while revenue between January and November has jumped 32% year-over-year. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC, the world's largest contract chip manufacturer, are falling about 1% in premarket trading but have almost doubled this year.

December 10, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 10, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of the following ETF: YieldMax™ MARA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSE Arca: MARO) MARO seeks to generate current income by pursuing options-based strategies on MARA Holdings, Inc. (MARA). MARO is actively managed by ZEGA Financial. MARO does not invest directly in MARA. MARO is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, MARO will be a Group B ETF and its first distribution is expected to be announced on January 2, 2025. Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. The performance data quoted above represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (833) 378-0717. Note: CRSH, FIAT, DIPS and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. Distributions are not guaranteed. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from month to month and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Prospectuses Click here. Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERNCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer time periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer time periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given month. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given time period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Salesforce vs. Oracle Stock

The Salesforce logo appears on the screen of a smartphone in Reno, United States, on November 29, ... [+] 2024. (Photo by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Given its better valuation, we believe that Salesforce stock (NYSE: CRM) is currently a better pick over its peer, Oracle stock. CRM stock trades at 9.5x trailing revenues, versus 9.8x for ORCL. Although Oracle is more profitable, Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think CRM will outperform ORCL in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. ORCL stock has seen strong gains of 225% from levels of $60 in early January 2021 to around $195 now, vs. an increase of about 65% for CRM stock from $220 to $360. This compares with roughly 60% gains for the S&P 500 over this four-year period. Admirably, ORCL stock has outperformed the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 37% in 2021, -5% in 2022, 31% in 2023, and 85% so far in 2024. CRM stock hasn’t been that consistent, with returns of 14% in 2021, -48% in 2022, 98% in 2023, and 38% this year – indicating that CRM underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. Separately, for another strong stock this year see What’s Behind The 80% Rise In Meta Stock? In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including META, COMM, and AAPL, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Salesforce has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 18.1% from $21.3 billion in 2021 to $34.9 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in January). On the other hand, Oracle’s average revenue growth rate of 9.5% from $40.5 billion in 2021 to $53 billion in 2024 (fiscal ends in May) over this period has been comparatively slower. Salesforce’s revenue growth lately has been driven by an increase in subscription and support sales, amid increased demand for its cloud-based offerings, including – Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and Marketing Cloud. Salesforce aims to grow its revenues by leveraging the technological revolution that includes the demand for artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company is benefiting from its AI system – Agentforce. The company continues to introduce AI capabilities across its offerings, which is resulting in increased adoption. Oracle’s revenue growth is also being driven by increased consumption of its cloud offerings. Oracle is benefiting from its success with generative AI workloads. In fact, it expects its revenue to double in five years, as more on-site database customers move to the cloud. As an aside, check out Sell LULU Stock, Buy eBay? Looking forward, both Salesforce and Oracle are expected to benefit from the rising demand for cloud and AI. Oracle is investing in AI infrastructure and has partnered with key players, including AWS, Microsoft, and Google. We expect both companies to see their sales rise at a low double-digit average annual growth rate over the next three years. Looking at profitability, Oracle’s adjusted net income margin has declined from 34.9% in 2021 to 29.7% in 2024, while that for Salesforce has risen from 21.6% to 23.2% over this period. Now, Oracle’s 30.3% adjusted net income margin for the last twelve-month period fares much better than 25.5% for Salesforce. From a financial risk perspective, Salesforce seems to have an edge over Oracle. Its 3% debt as a percentage of equity is much lower than 16% for Oracle, while its 14% cash a percentage of assets is higher than 8% for the latter. This implies that Salesforce has a better debt position and more cash cushion. We see that Salesforce has seen better revenue growth and it offers lower financial risk. On the other hand, Oracle is more profitable. Now, looking at prospects, we believe CRM is the better choice of the two. At its current levels of $360, CRM stock is trading at 37x its trailing adjusted earnings of $9.70 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 43x over the last four years. In comparison, at its current levels of around $190, ORCL stock trades at 32x its trailing adjusted earnings of $5.77 per share, versus the stock’s average P/E ratio of 22x over the last four years. We think that an upward revision in valuation multiple for both stocks is warranted, given the rising AI-based cloud demand. ORCL stock, trading at a valuation multiple much higher than its historical average, while CRM stock trading at a multiple lower than historical average, doesn’t make sense in our view. We think this gap will narrow in favor of CRM. While both stocks may offer robust gains in the long term, if one has to pick, we believe CRM is a better choice. While CRM may outperform ORCL in the next three years, it is helpful to see how Salesforce’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

(Bloomberg) -- Baillie Gifford & Co., known for investing in hyper-growth tech stocks, now likes “boring” US infrastructure companies as it sees a building boom after many years of under-investment. Most Read from Bloomberg Brace for a Nationwide Shuffle of Corporate Headquarters A Chicago Skyscraper Cements the Legacy of a Visionary Postmodern Architect Cloud Computing Tax Threatens Chicago’s Silicon Valley Ambitions NYC’s Run-Down Bus Terminal Gets Approval for $10 Billion Revamp Kansas City Looks Back on its Long, Costly Ride With Microtransit “We think there’s going to be a massive building boom certainly in the US, the UK and in some other places,” Stuart Dunbar, a partner at the Edinburgh-based firm, told Bloomberg in Tokyo. Baillie Gifford still likes some US big tech stocks but is underweight on many of them now because of high valuations, he said. “In parts of Europe and in the US, the infrastructure is just falling apart. It’s been under-invested for 50 years and it’s getting to the point where it can’t be ignored any longer, with bridges falling down literally,” Dunbar said. “It’s quite an unexpected source of growth, like building aggregates suppliers, drainage systems providers,” he said, mentioning companies such as Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and Stella-Jones Inc. as among its favorites. Baillie Gifford has been known for its big bets in large tech firms such as Tesla Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But it’s now underweight most such US stocks — an unusual stance for the firm — despite its positive long-term view on them, Dunbar said. Investment in suppliers of water pipes and utility poles is by no means a departure from its growth stock strategy, though. “We will look wherever we need to look to try to find the companies that we think have got the ability not only to grow quickly, but to do so profitably,” Dunbar said. For tech stocks, Nvidia Corp.’s high valuation depends on continued growth, according to the investment manager. Nvidia, which makes chips used for AI data centers, trades at 34 times expected earnings, well above 23 times for the S&P 500 index. “That growth isn’t likely sustainable in the long term unless we start to see meaningful value coming through from applications of AI, so we’ve been top-slicing it,” Dunbar said, adding that Baillie Gifford still holds Nvidia and doesn’t have a negative view. Baillie Gifford is more cautious on Google parent Alphabet Inc., fretting that “AI could be a Google killer,” Dunbar said. On the other hand, it’s still a fan of Amazon because strong research and development spending allows it keep a solid competitive position. Meta also has a strong data set on which the firm can build AI capabilities, while Tesla has “incredible robotics and energy businesses” even though its rival BYD Co. “makes better cars at half the price,” he added. BYD is among China tech shares that Baillie Gifford sees coming back, despite headwinds from threats of tariffs from the US, and Europe in the case of EV makers. Elsewhere, the investment manager thinks digital banking is an important trend, betting on fintech firms such as Nu Holdings Ltd. in Brazil and Adyen NV in the Netherlands.
