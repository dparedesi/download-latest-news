We have now updated our massive collection of Black Friday deals, the Google sale is already live, and Samsung is in full swing, but there’s even more we want to bring to your attention. Firstly, Backbone One USB-C – one of the best Android mobile game controllers – is now seeing solid price drops, but we also have Samsung’s originally $600 34-inch Odyssey G5 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor at just $265 as well. A fresh collection of Google Nest deals are also live – Nest Doorbell and cameras are now now up to $100 off – and we have some seriously notable deals on ultra-affordable A9+ and S6 Samsung Galaxy tabs from $149. Everything else awaits below. If you’re looking for a super affordable 2024 tablet for casual browsing, video chatting, or even something for the whole fam, the Amazon Black Friday sale is now offering Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S6 Lite Android tablet down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $330, this is $130 off, $30 below the early Black Friday sale price, and within $0.50 of the lowest we have ever tracked. This is easily one of the most notable deals we have tracked since its release back in April and among the most affordable Samsung tablets we have seen to date that actually ships with the S Pen in the box. It is worth noting that the Galaxy Tab S6 comes in at roughly $50 more than the Black Friday deal we are tracking on the brand’s other ultra-affordable tab, the Galaxy Tab A9+ at $149 shipped. However, as alluded to above, the S6 is a more complete experience with slightly better specs and includes the Samsung S Pen so you can sketch and doodle away without spending any more money. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: The Google Black Friday sale is now live, we are tracking the very first price drop on the all-new Google Nest Learning Thermostat 4th Gen, and now it’s time to take a look at the rest of this year’s Google Nest Black Friday offers. Alongside the new smart thermostat deal, we are also tracking price drops on the latest Nest Cam Outdoor or Indoor Battery model as well as the wired indoor variants and the Google Nest Doorbell down at $99.98 shipped in all colorways. This includes both the wireless and the wired options for folks looking to integrate the smart video doorbell into an existing chime and power system. Everything you need to know about the all-time low now live on the brand new Google Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Gen) is waiting right here. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday deals, Amazon is offering one of the best gaming monitor deals by dropping Samsung’s 34-inch Odyssey G55T 165Hz WQHD curved gaming monitor to $265.04 shipped. This originally $600 gaming display has fetched as much as $500 in recent months, but it has mostly been sitting at the $380 mark. We saw it drop to $300 over a month ago in September, but today’s Black Friday deal at Amazon lands it $35 below that price to mark a new all-time low. This is easily one of the best gaming monitor deals we’ve tracked over the last few weeks for Black Friday, and you can learn more about this model below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

(@Metaplanet_JP) November 28, 2024 “The majority of the funds raised this time will be strategically allocated for the purchase of additional Bitcoin,” the notice reads. “We have made it clear that we intend to utilize debt and periodic stock issuance to systematically increase our Bitcoin holdings while reducing exposure to a depreciating yen.” Metaplanet further highlighted that Bitcoin’s “prominence continues to grow” after it nearly hit $100,000 earlier this month. On the other hand, “the Japanese yen continues to depreciate, with the USD/JPY exchange rate returning to the 154 level on the same day, presenting ongoing concerns.” “Given these circumstances, we recognize the urgent importance of increasing our Bitcoin holdings and have therefore decided to proceed with this fundraising initiative,” the company concluded. The stock acquisition still needs approval by local regulators under Japan’s Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. If approved, the operation will take place from Dec. 16, 2024 until June 16, 2025. At the current price of about $98,000 per Bitcoin, the company would acquire over 638 BTC with the proceedings of the deal. Metaplanet also said that it had decided to put aside its “metaverse related businesses plans” since “there is still no prospect of profitability, and has decided to incorporate the purchase and holding of Bitcoin as part of our stated corporate treasury strategy.” The comments follow public disappointment with the results of the metaverse under development by Meta (formally Facebook) following a $177 billion investment by the company by the summer of 2022. As Decrypt reported at the time, the platforms' graphics being heralded as at the forefront of the metaverse look about the same—if not worse—than the 20-year-old virtual world Second Life. In its acquisition of Bitcoin for its corporate treasury, Metaplanet is following in the footsteps of U.S. business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which under the direction of its chairman Michael Saylor has pursued an aggressive strategy of Bitcoin purchases. MicroStrategy now holds well over 1% of Bitcoin’s 21 million supply, while Saylor has touted his “Bitcoin playbook” to a number of firms, including Tesla and more recently Microsoft. Still, after seeing renewed interest at the start of the current crypto bull run, MicroStrategy’s stock took a 16% dive just as Bitcoin was approaching $100,000. At the time, one analyst explained why their firm took a short position on MicroStrategy while being long on Bitcoin.

UPDATED 10:16 EST / NOVEMBER 29 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof It’s time to get ready for Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference, starting Monday in Las Vegas — the biggest cloud computing conference of the year. To prepare, check out our new Special Report: AI and the Cloud, with exclusive features, interviews and analysis, and all the important news starting next week. We take a deep dive into AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation, and also analyze the prospects for AI’s hottest new thing: agents, as well as the considerable challenges to their roll-out. In addition, theCUBE Research analyst John Furrier interviewed top AWS executives ahead of re:Invent, including AI and data chief Swami Sivasubramanian, enterprise solutions head Colleen Aubrey, developer experience VP Deepak Singh, and Dilip Kumar, head of Q for Business. We’ll have all the news next week from re:Invent keynotes and interviews, along with analysis from theCUBE Research and interviews on theCUBE. In other news this past week, big money continued to roll into cybersecurity as Halcyon raised $100 million and N-able acquired Adlumin for $266 million. TheCUBE Research Chief Analyst Dave Vellante assessed his 2024 predictions. ChatGPT gave him an A-, but he gave himself a B. This week saw a mixed bag of earnings reports ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday, but some significant guidance disappointments from Dell, HP, CrowdStrike and Workday weighed on stocks. Meantime, Pony AI’s IPO disappointed as well. Lots of earnings reports are coming next week too, among them Hewlett Packard Enterprise, UiPath, Salesforce and Zscaler. Here’s the news and analysis this week from SiliconANGLE and beyond: Check out our newest special report on the intersection of cloud and AI, ahead of AWS’ annual re:Invent conference Dec. 2-6 in Las Vegas. As at just about every tech conference these days, AI will be the star. We’ll have all the news from re:Invent, plus exclusive interviews from theCUBE and analysis from theCUBE Research. First up is our deep dive into Annapurna Labs, Amazon’s accelerator chip operation in Austin, Texas: Amazon’s secretive AI weapon: An exclusive look inside AWS’ Annapurna Labs chip operation We took a deep dive into the promises and perils of agentic AI, which will be a prime topic at re:Invent — and just about every tech conference after that: Safety and reliability concerns temper agentic AI mania And a closer look at the challenges underneath the hype: AI agents are practical.

When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more It's Black Friday, and that means it's time to save big on all kinds of products, including gaming gear. Our experts have rounded up the best Black Friday gaming deals on consoles, accessories, and more. From powerful PCs and Xbox systems to wireless controllers and headsets, these are the discounts that are actually worth your time. And for more savings, visit our complete roundup of all the best Black Friday deals across categories. Some of the best Black Friday gaming deals we've found so far include a rare $125 discount on a PS5 Digital Edition console. We also recommended this $50 discount on the 1TB Xbox Series X Digital Edition, which is the lowest it's ever dropped to. Walmart is also selling a Switch Mario Kart 8 bundle for just $249. When you factor in the discount and freebies already included, this package offers a total savings of $130. Gaming PCs from brands like HP with RTX graphic cards are also down to new low prices. These Black Friday gaming deals are expected to remain active through midnight PT. Some discounts could extend through the weekend and Cyber Monday, but there's no guarantee, so we recommend snagging these savings while they last. For Black Friday, Nintendo is offering a great bundle that includes a Switch console, a free copy of Mario Kart 8, and a one-year Nintendo Switch online membership. The bundle is available with the Switch or Switch OLED. Each bundle offers a savings of $80 to begin with and Walmart has them both on sale for $50 off, so you get a total savings of $130. Nintendo Switch Joy-Con can be used wirelessly, or attached to the Grip, or attached to the Switch itself. They can even be turned sideways and used as separate, albeit limited, controllers. The 8BitDo Ultimate is comfortable, highly customizable, and comes with a convenient charging dock. The PowerA Enhanced Wired Controller for Nintendo Switch is a full-sized gamepad that offers bigger buttons, better joysticks, and extra customizable buttons. The Spectra model also has color-changing LED lights. The Tomtoc Carrying Case comes with an integrated stand that lets you play your Switch while charging it. This Ivoler case can be carried with a handle or shoulder strap. It's big enough to fit a Switch, dock, controller, and 18 game cards. Microsoft is offering an excellent selection of Black Friday gaming deals, including discounts on various Xbox consoles and accessories. The Xbox Series X Digital Edition is down to an all-time low of $398 while the 512GB Xbox Series S is $50 off at Best Buy. This Series X model offers the same graphical performance as the standard edition but it does not include a disc drive. It typically costs $50 less than the disc-drive model. The Xbox Series S isn't as powerful as the Series X, but it still benefits from Xbox Game Pass and Microsoft's robust online services, offering great value for less money. The iconic Xbox Core controller works with various Xbox systems, but it can also connect to your PC, iPhone, iPad, or Android. Microsoft’s official battery pack for the Xbox wireless controller replaces the standard AA batteries and can be charged with the controller’s usual USB cable. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X shares many features with the more expensive Nova Pro, like a noise-canceling microphone and wireless cross-platform support, while maintaining a midrange price. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate offers a Netflix-style subscription with hundreds of games for Xbox and PC, along with online multiplayer support. Members can also stream games on mobile devices, Samsung TVs, and select Fire TV sticks. An Ultimate membership typically costs $20, but most retailers sell one month for $17. PlayStation 5 systems and accessories are seeing great discounts for Black Friday. The Digital Edition console is down to a new low. Meanwhile, the PS5 with disc drive is available for $75 off, and this PS VR2 bundle is a whopping $250 off. And though not discounted, the brand-new PS5 Pro is in stock for its regular price of $699. The PS5 is one of the best consoles thanks to its powerful hardware, exclusives, and 4K Blu-ray drive. Though it typically costs $50 more than the digital-edition PS5, this model lets you play game discs. This slim version of the console is also slightly smaller than the original and has 1TB of storage. The PS5 Slim Digital Edition is for downloadable games only and costs $50 less than the standard PS5 with a disc drive. A disc drive add-on can be bought separately should you wish to use physical discs at a later date for an extra $80. This bundle includes a slim disc-drive edition PlayStation 5 console with a copy of Dragon Age: The Veilguard, the latest entry in the popular action RPG franchise. With this bundle, buyers get a slim PlayStation 5 console with disc drive and a copy of Madden NFL 25, the latest game in the long-running football series. The PS VR2 is a virtual reality headset built for the PS5. It also supports a PC adapter (sold separately for $60) that can pair with computers to play SteamVR games. This bundle includes a copy of Horizon Call of the Mountain. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. These wireless earbuds are designed for gaming with a PS5 or PC. They support active noise cancellation and a 2.4GHz wireless connection for lag-free playback. This wired gaming headset has a white color scheme that's designed to match the PS5 console. It has a boom microphone for voice chat that can be flipped up to mute. For Black Friday, you can now snag a Quest 3S bundle that includes the 128GB headset, the new Batman: Arkham Shadow game, a three-month Meta Quest+ subscription, and a $75 Amazon credit for a total of $299. To get the deal, just use the coupon code QUEST75 at checkout. You can learn more about the 3S VR headset in our Meta Quest 3S review. The 256GB Quest 3S and the step-up Quest 3 model aren't available with the Amazon credit but they both still include the free game and subscription. The Quest 3S is Meta's most affordable VR headset. It has the same chipset and gaming performance as the pricier Quest 3, but its display isn't as sharp. This is an excellent fit for casual users who want a more budget-friendly entry into the world of VR. This is a great time to buy, as you'll get a free download of the Batman: Arkham Shadow game (worth $50) and three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). As an added bonus when buying from Amazon, enter code: QUEST75 at checkout to get a free $75 credit. The larger 256GB model of the new Quest 3S is for the more dedicated VR fan keen on downloading and storing a larger number of games and apps at once. VR newcomers would be better off saving some cash with the 128GB model in our book, though. Otherwise, you're getting the same excellent value headset, and all purchases currently include a code for the super-fun Batman: Arkham Shadow game (a $50 value). You're also getting three months of Meta Quest+ (worth $24). The slightly older Meta Quest 3 VR headset builds on its predecessor with mixed reality capabilities, 4K resolution, an upgraded processor that offers double the speed, and new ergonomics for the head unit and controllers. Like the newer 3S model it also comes with a free download code for the new Batman: Arkham Shadow VR game (worth $50). The larger 512GB version is the only one remaining, as the smaller ones have now been discontinued. PC and laptop gamers can save tons on new systems during Black Friday. Right now, the Asus TUG A15 gaming laptop is down to $999 which is just $20 more than the lowest price it's ever dipped to. We're also seeing great deals on monitors, like this 50% discount on Samsung's 43-inch Odyssey Neo G7. The Asus TUF is built with military-grade shock resistance, and its incredibly powerful battery can last for around nine hours on a single charge. This Katana model sports a 15.6-inch QHD display capable of up to 165Hz. It has a supremely powerful processor, and and upper midrange GPU for games that can handle any game at high settings, depending on the game and the frame rate you're looking for. Acer's Nitro V Series is known for offering solid performance at budget-friendly prices. This entry-level gaming laptop features an Intel Core i7 CPU and a GeForce RTX 4050 GPU. It also has a Full HD 15.6-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate. HP's Omen PCs are built for gamers, and this configuration features a great lower-midrange setup with an AMD Ryzen 7 8700G CPU, 6GB DDR5 Mmmory, and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti GPU. This 27-inch 1440p monitor from LG has a well-rounded set of features and a great price, which help make it an ideal choice for most gamers, whether you need a single monitor or want to build a side-by-side setup. Alienware's AW3225QF is the first 4K QD-OLED monitor and one of the few 4K displays you can get with a 240Hz refresh rate. It's expensive but delivers stunning performance while setting a new benchmark for gaming displays. The Samsung Odyssey Neo series offers 4K image quality in a sleek and stylish package. They’re among the best gaming monitors on the market. The Asus ROG Ally is a handheld gaming PC with Windows 11. Its hardware is powerful enough to run nearly any game, but its control issues make it awkward to use. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Logitech G305 Lightspeed is an excellent choice for entry-level users, casual gamers, and those shopping on a budget. Despite being one of the most affordable wireless gaming mice on the market, it doesn't compromise quality or performance, and it's almost always on sale. See more of our Black Friday roundups The PS5 and Xbox Series X are both powerful gaming consoles with similar graphical capabilities. However, they each have pros and cons. Our gaming experts think the PS5 has an edge in exclusive games, with franchises like Marvel's Spider-Man, The Last of Us, God of War, Ratchet & Clank, Astro Bot, and Ghosts of Tsushima that you can't play on Xbox systems. We also prefer the PS5's DualSense controller since it has extra perks like haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. Xbox consoles have their own exclusive titles as well, including Halo and Starfield, but the selection isn't as large and Microsoft is starting to experiment with releasing some of its first-party games on the PS5. However, the Xbox Series X has an edge in multimedia capabilities and its Game Pass subscription service, which offers tons of titles, including brand-new releases the day they launch in stores. Ultimately, you can't go wrong with either system, but the PS5's exclusive titles and unique controller make it a slightly better option for gamers who don't want to miss out on big releases. Check out our PS5 vs. Xbox Series X comparison for more details. Top gaming PCs and laptops feature components built to handle modern games at stable frame rates, along with support for features like ray tracing and AI upscaling. This makes them notably more expensive than typical computers designed for everyday use. High-end gaming desktops and laptops can cost more than $3,000 but entry-level options with solid specifications can be found for around $800 to $1,000. When shopping for a gaming computer the most important spec to look at is the graphics card. Nvidia and AMD are the top brands in graphics cards, and they both sell excellent options. However, Nvidia's top GPUs are typically more powerful and the company's RTX 40-series cards have a feature called "Deep Learning Super Sampling" (DLSS), which can improve frame rates with AI. Meanwhile, AMD's graphics cards tend to be a little less powerful by are also often less expensive. For the best gaming performance, we recommend focusing on PCs and laptops that have an Nvidia RTX 4050 graphics card or higher. Shopping for more discounts today?

Title: How did Nvidia expand nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years?

Good morning! Hallam Bullock here, once again writing to you from London. Black Friday is upon us and Business Insider's Reviews team has rounded up the best deals on the products and brands they swear by. In today's newsletter, we're looking at how Nvidia expanded nearly 20-fold in just over 20 years. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. A few years ago, Nvidia was largely unknown. It's difficult to believe, considering the company can now boast about back-to-back earnings beats, a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion, and a stock price that has climbed nearly 200% over the past 12 months — Citi analysts also recently eyed a catalyst that could push the stock a further 27% by January. So, how can a company grow so much, so quickly? The data behind the evolution of Nvidia's workforce tells the story, BI's Emma Cosgrove writes. Nvidia's workforce has grown nearly 20-fold since 2003. Beyond its historic rise in market value, this growth has been aided by a slew of employee incentives, including a futuristic headquarters that reflects the company's "no barriers and no boundaries" philosophy (it's easy to see why they named the building "Voyager"). This workforce growth continued through 2024, a particularly brutal year for the Tech industry, during which time Meta and Google made significant cuts. It's one of the best-paying firms in Silicon Valley. In 2019, Microsoft's median employee salary was nearly $20,000 higher than a Nvidia worker. As of January 2024, Nvidia's median salary (excluding the CEO) had surpassed Microsoft and reached more than $220,000. As the above chart illustrates, it's also left other tech giants in the dust. Nvidia's revenue per employee has recovered after years of investment. The company's revenue-to-headcount ratio showed a downward trend from 2003 until 2014, and then steady upward progress until the AI boom in 2023. During that year, this ratio doubled. This is in part due to early investment in building a programming software layer called CUDA — the main element that keeps AI builders from easily switching to competing hardware. However, the company isn't as far ahead in other areas. Gender representation in the company's workforce and the semiconductor industry as a whole has remained relatively unchanged in the last decade, Emma writes.

Major difference with Marandi above. Marandi before had stressed that Iran had had to hold its fire while Gaza ceasefire talks were on so as not to be charged with being a spoiler. The US has played up the idea that Gaza ceasefire talks are again on after the Lebanon ceasefire. So those may need to die out before Iran strikes again. Marandi, who was correct and in a minority before re Iran’s actions, maintains that Iran will hit again and hit much harder than before.

Russia is close to an autarky these days, and it banks are not exposed, so this is less consequential than it might seem. If I had to guess, the Russian very high inflation plays a big role, particularly if interest rates are deemed to be too low in light of that. But it may just as well have to do with technical matters, like Russia (generally? always?) requiring FX trades to be crossed on the Moscow Stock Exchange. While this greatly increases the value of Russia’s energy exports in home country terms and should boost inbound tourism, Russians who normally travel to warmer countries for vacations will likely shelve those plans for now. Historically a low rouble has been seen, like depressed stock prices, as a sign within Russia of weakness. I don’t know if that is as true now as it was historically. A more granular take: What is happening with the ruble? The ruble has experienced the most significant rate of devaluation since August 2023. Compared to the dollar, it has reached lows not seen since mid-March 2022. It's currently trading at 108.1 rubles per USD.

Maybe they even tried to steer him towards IMF loans or something. The fact that the Chinese are acting just like business people may have saved his bacon and explains why he is so happy with them. In a similar vein, from the link to Numb in India with this quote, “…it turns out that if you want someone to administer capitalism well, you could do a lot worse than a Communist Party.” Starmer will vote in favour IMO. Why do I predict that? Our newly elected UK Labour MP was one of the new intake that got immediate promotion to a select committee (thus annoying long-serving MPs). This has confirmed in the minds of everyone round here that he’s a Starmer …. ahem …. loyalist. He posted his letter to Twitter announcing his support in last day or so. He might have hoped it wouldn’t get noticed, given that he’s one of many Labour MPs suddenly to have new Blue-sky accounts. So I screenshot his letter and posted it to my mostly quiet Blue-sky account, tagging him. Irony is I’m probably not his least liked member of my family after my mum wrote rude stuff about him on Facebook within weeks of voting for him at the general election. All fun and games in this very marginal constituency! His track record proves he is all in for the kill https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/starmer-winter-fuel-allowance-pensioners-b2611986.html When did this phrase “assisted dying” get chosen as the message. Euthanasia just sounds bad, can’t get the dogs to.eat the dog food, but assisted dying? That’s all about the actus reus and not about the mens rea. That’s not what I would want: I would want a decriminalisation of the assistance of my suicide, with a boring paper-based process involving the court of protection and some sort of independent medical examination that I am compos mentis. I realise this rules out dementia patients and others who lack capacity but I don’t see how to resolve the dangers in allowing us to choose that others would like to die. A tolerance of the dual effect of opiates in pain relief would be one route, I suppose, provided the person acting on behalf of the incapacitated has explicitly agreed and there was no previously “do not sedate to death” paperwork. Re Russian economy: Yesterday I had a long phonecall with an excellent Russian journalist whom I have known for a long time. We talked about the prospects of an armistice and he believes that chances are quite good. Trump would give Selensky the necessary cover – “the bastard doesn´t want to deliver weapons anymore” – to call it quits and Putin is under a lot of domestic pressure because of inflation. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways and other economic troubles. I’m hoping your journalist friend is correct. I for one would appreciate moving away from the cliff edge. I propose that no one but NATO should want this result at this stage–least of all Russia. If the conflict freezes prior to the collapse of Ukraine’s military, I’ll bet we will be at war again–and worse–within a few years. Consider how emboldened the Ukrainian regime was by Putin’s restraint and miscalculations in 2022. On net NATO has not yet been chastened, but rather emboldened up to now. That is a recipe for more red-line pushing and more war. Yes. Too optimistic?- The Europeans will try to torpedo any kind of agreement. What if they decide to admit Ukraine in the EU (I am not sure this is possible) that is now seen in Russia as NATO proxy? Yea, right. MInsk 3 here we come. All because of that damned inflation, and spareparts for the railways. Economic troubles are so bad that Russians are considering selling the Crimean Bridge. Did…did you just say that if people are convinced that the west is winning in the Ukraine, that the Russians have a bridge to sell us? In typical Yankee Trader style, we will then try to purchase said bridge with gold painted BRICS. Wuk? Is that you? Punsters are proliferating on this site. Sorry, I am but a humble shadow of the refulgent Wukchumni. along with swampland in Florida – Is your contact associated wit the late J Barkley Rosser’s “contacts”? There are the similar voices saying “you did not do enough” on both sides. For the NATO side it is “not enough [effete, V-1 like] super weapons, soon enough, in numbers enough! For the Russian side: “you did not stay the course”. “Staying the course” is less insane than more V-1’s. There are also big problems re spareparts for the railways […] That is sort of surprising to hear since Russian railways have their own gauge and own couplings, which means they’ve always been sort of closed market for the rolling stock. Soviet Union/Russia always (had to) build their own diesel and electric engines, so not much of replacing imports to do, really. And given the strategic significance of the railroads to the military logistics, one would be aghast to find out it has been neglected. Even more surprising is lack of problems with parts for Boeings. Please “Snowless Finns suffer ‘eco-grief” ‘Snow has special meaning for many Finns, often connected to cherished memories, but a lack of snow can cause a sense of loss that researchers refer to as eco-grief.’ It’s those damn Russians. Finland joins NATO. Then suddenly their snow starts going away. Coincidence? I think not! Does the Baltic Sea still freeze in winter, allowing one to wander for kilometers on the ice? Most of it does, but not to the extent it did in the 1950’s. I’m happy my kids have had the experience, but I’m not sure their kids will know the feeling… Damn, those pesky Russians are behind everything. This quote from Anne Karhu-Angeli caught my eye, Snow brings light with it. It’s no longer dark and horrible. You can feel it in your body and your mind,” she says. I have a friend in Alaska who every winter spends two weeks in Oaxaca to beat the endless nights. He has mentioned that this is a thing for those who can manage it, and that the extended winter nights literally drive people crazy. Same thing in all Nordic countries. During winter holidays, those who can fly away to places with a 100% sun-guarantee. Frankly, most of us endure the short period of dark, wet and cold before the permasnow falls and it’s winter wonderland everywhere. Only the weak leaves. For any military purpose they should be filtered away. The real men, wearing pants, stick around and laugh at the darkness while waiting for the snow. Photoperiod is linked to depression to which even real men in pants are susceptible. When the going gets tough, the tough gets going, laughing maniacally through the depression and snow until sometime in May. Lol, my version includes whiskey and maybe a re-read of Blood Meridian. My wife is very susceptible to Seasonal Affective Disorder while I hardly notice it at all. Mind you I haven’t ever lived north of Quebec City. Nothing weak about taking Vitamin D supplements…you don’t even have to wear pants! Yep. Remember when the Chilean trapped miners were supplied with water, food, and vitamin D, specifically, while waiting for their eventual rescue? There was a reason for that. / ;) https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna39000893 Nordic diet, oddly enough, is full of salmon, milk and eggs. Have lived here decades, never taken Vitamin D supplements. Also helps to have a fair skin tone. I am male and have lived on the coast of Alaska most of my adult life. Dont always wear pants. Winter is when i head into the woodshop crank the heat and the tunes crack a beer and start creating something. Spring comes all too soon it seems. When the sun does come out you go for a walk. Sometimes end up with the geezers at local watering hole. Good ideas start there sometimes. I know i live a blessed life. Being a member of AFDU (Alaska functional drunkards union local chapter 86). You cant drink all day if you dont start in the morning. Cheers. I once saw a funny text describing how to determine the temperature without resorting to a graded thermometer. Everything was based on what people from various countries (supposedly) do when the weather becomes colder and colder. Clues such as “Finns finally close the windows before going to sleep”, or “Even your Volvo helps you plan the trip to Tunisia” and the like. The real men, wearing pants, leaping from tree to tree as they float down the mighty rivers of British Columbia … https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfRdur8GLBM&t=6s I lived in Seattle for 35 years. I got around the dark and wet by going on bike rides in the wet and cold. It took a couple of years to figure out how dress correctly and bring multiple pairs of gloves and an extra base layer to change into. Having company to share in the fun misery also helps. For the record there was sometimes alcohol involved and herb. Before you knew it the days get a bit longer and there is light at the end of the tunnel. If possible, and many do, a get away to the SW or warmer parts are a nice option. Now that I have been south for 5 years, I am not sure if I miss it. I do miss the biking crew. Shout out to the PNW riders. Useful Idiots on RU just posted: Ukraine vs. Russia: Nuclear War, Frozen Conflict, or Peace? Debate w/ Simon Shuster Senior Correspondent at TIME Magazine Simon Shuster on newly increased aggression in the Ukraine-Russian War p.s. since I only started – Shuster as expected so far, is – well – in military terms not speaking about Ukraine but some other conflict on Venus or Pluto may be. But not this one. https://www.usefulidiotspodcast.com/p/ukraine-vs-russia-nuclear-war-frozen I wonder what others have to say to this. Because the deep-seated prejudice of Shuster is very unsettling to witness. The disagreement with Maté starts TC 20:00. 99% of what Shuster says is State Department ideology the kind of which doves share. Which is probably worse than nutty people who want to to bomb Russia but would never dare to carry that out. Shuster is undermining serious understanding and makes scrutiny of US responsibility virtually impossible in the future. One point where Maté agrees much too easily is Shuster´s allegation that Putin – of course – was lying around 2015 when neglecting RU troops in Donbas. Jacques Baud has showed that there were no covert RU supportive military operations. What is an undeniable indication that something is fundamentally wrong here – never would Shuster in this context say that e.g. Biden oder Austen or Blinken lied. Putin? YESSSS! WH? neva. p.s.When Shuster says “the genocidal regime” early on it´s hard to wonder why the interview is happening at all. What is the surplus value here? Of course their bulk audience is not just NC-commentariat. But it´s disconcerting. With this kind of mindset I see no way out of this for the next 50 years. This is a closed “cold case.” This is really distressing. Re 2015, the media was braying with one voice that Russia was sending troops and materiel to Donbass. Baud finding for the UN that there were no Russian small arms sent would seen pretty dispositive, since that would be the easiest to provide. The theory I once had, but it does not fit Baud’s facts, is that Russia might have provided deniable support, by allowing Russian soldiers to go what would otherwise be AWOL for some set time to help relatives in Donbass. There’s the evidence of the contemporary Donbass militias that they felt left alone by Russia, and the rather recent personal apology by V.V. Putin for leaving the Donbass alone supporting the narrative that Russia indeed did not provide more than diplomatic support for the militias and population that, shall we say, defended the Ukrainian constitution. That said, Russia is Russia, and as far as autocrats go, Putin has no control over what people do. So if they decide to volunteer for Donbass militias, they will. Oddly enough, there seems to be not so small anti-authoritarian inside every Russian. Shuster is crawling into the rabbit hole with every passing minute of that interview. He is insane. It is getting worse when Halper asks him about WWIII. TC 53:00. Baud revisits the 2015 issue with Eva Bartlett here (I already posted this back then): JACQUES BAUD: NATO THREATENED RUSSIA DECADES BEFORE 2022 27/10/2024 https://rumble.com/v5fjhrh-jacques-baud-nato-threatened-russia-decades-before-2022.html When I listened to it then I made following notes (I have no time now to re-check, sorry): TC – 21:00 Crimea NO green men TC – 33:00 no human rights for minorities TC – 42:00 UKR said officially 2015 no RU Army in Donbas TC – 49:00 Z´s decree 24/3/2021 to conquer South and the Donbas and that led to SMO TC – 51:00 never separatism only autonomy I take a wild guess: Not a word of this in Shuster´s book. p.s. Baud is very difficult to contact as I understand. And just because it fits: “Boris Johnson: ‘Mate, let’s face it… We’re waging a proxy war” https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1862320989432160459 Bertrand: “Wow, this has got to be one of the most ‘saying the quiet part out loud’ statements since the start of the Ukraine war.” But yeah, it´s about Ukrainian agency against a genocidal regime. When did Shuster last look up the definition of genocide. Fortunately Maté didn´t ask him about Gaza. Then I would have probably smashed my computer against the wall – for lack of better – fucking – agency… Nima and Orlov. Pretty straight forward. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBQhqveeXg&t=9s Time magazine was founded by Henry Luce in 1923. Luce was a big promoter of The American Century idea. https://classicsofstrategy.com/2015/09/16/the-american-century-luce/ The Time’s reportage apples haven’t fallen far from the founder’s tree, so to say. / ;) I think the US ‘deep state’ or establishment realized after this year’s US prez election that podcasts and alt media are important news outlets for a huge number of people. It’s not enough to dismiss the non-MSM as ridiculous and unimportant anymore. (The MSM made themselves ridiculous in the eyes of many over the past few years.) I expect to see more push into the alt outlets by ye olde deep state/establishment actors going forward. It’s an ironic idea that the establishment figures might try to regain credibility by going on alt media and podcasts, not necessarily to tell the truth. / ;) good point! Henry’s wife was Clair Booth Luce, famous in her day as a writer and ardent anti-communist, anti-USSR. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Boothe_Luce Western Europe and the US opinion of Russia hasn’t changed in 200 years. The form of govt didn’t really matter. Tzarist, Soviet, non-communist, that didn’t really matter to the West, imo. It was and is something else that matters. That something is the fact that Western mineral resources somehow got buried in Russia’s ditch. They are still missing talk radio, which is HUUGE in some parts of the country. Remember the debacle of Air America? See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_America_(radio_network) (I know it’s ‘wiki’ but, well then….) It’s all about that elusive “Big Tent” show. The Democrat/PMC Party has become based on a niche demographic. Love him or hate him, Trump has tapped into a real goldmine of “populist” angst. As Lambert says, without supplying concrete material benefits to the People as a group, not just a donor niche, the Party loses its original reason for existing. Maybe I am dating myself, but I have never listened to a podcast. I enjoyed Joe Rogan on News Radio. And, the last video game I played was Pong. I do listen to talk radio, but it’s so hard to wade through the BS. Henry Luce was the son of American missionaries to China, born in China, and returned to America in his teens. He passionately hated the Communists, and Time magazine was a huge supporter of the Vietnam war. Henry used to spike stories from his reporters in Vietnam and print handouts from the Pentagon instead. In spite of his efforts, some news from Vietnam managed to get through, but not much. After his death from a heart attack in 1968, his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, took over as publisher of his stable of magazines, and continued his anti-communist policies. Well , an entire mass media once promoted a “counterculture” by way of spawn of the military-industrial complex. ‘Why you should have a cat @ShouldHaveCat They know exactly what they’re doing 😂’ My god. I had forgotten that about cats. Sometimes having a cat in your home is like having an unsupervised toddler running around and not noticing them. Rev Kev Indeed! I have seen this same thing as in video! They always seem to have thought out whatever they are doing. Mine will very specifically open a certain drawer or cabinet, even a closet and go after a certain object. I have chastised myself for thinking that they are this smart. They are! I never had cats before these two and I’ve missed out on a whole world of amazing acts. I will have cats in my life forever now. Can’t believe I ever lived without them! The picture was most probably generated. Even the HTTP link looks like a prompt: “a-butterfly-with-orange-and-black-wings-on-a-beige-background”. Looks like a photo of a gift shop trinket.

A new Kingdom of “creature,” the AInimalia. ‘The Redheaded libertarian @TRHLofficial The Mayflower passengers who arrived in Plymouth November 11, 1620 vs. The Mayflower passengers who survived to Thanksgiving 1621, less than one year later.’ Looking at the survivors for patterns, I can see a few. Larger families had a better chance of surviving than individuals. Women were heavily hit. And I notice more than a few children/teenagers as well surviving. Of course that is all only first impressions and would need a statistical analysis to see what the real story was. Some food for thought… https://blackagendareport.com/end-american-thanksgivings-cause-universal-rejoicing-1 The End of American Thanksgivings: A Cause for Universal Rejoicing. “The Thanksgiving story is an absolution of the Pilgrims, whose brutal quest for absolute power in the New World is made to seem both religiously motivated and eminently human. Most importantly, the Pilgrims are depicted as victims – of harsh weather and their own naïve yet wholesome visions of a new beginning. In light of this carefully nurtured fable, whatever happened to the Indians, from Plymouth to California and beyond, in the aftermath of the 1621 dinner must be considered a mistake, the result of misunderstandings – at worst, a series of lamentable tragedies. The story provides the essential first frame of the American saga. It is unalloyed racist propaganda, a tale that endures because it served the purposes of a succession of the Pilgrims’ political heirs, in much the same way that Nazi-enhanced mythology of a glorious Aryan/German past advanced another murderous, expansionist mission.” thank you, best thing Glen Ford ever wrote, and he wrote many powerful essays. You also had basically 4 groups: the Puritans, who called themselves the Saints, (everyone else was a sinner), their indentured servants, a few stragglers crazy and well heeled enough to pay their own passage (as in why did they need to really hot-tail it out of England; dunno if any had indentured servants too) and the crew. Of my at least 7 (verified by church birth and death records and/or gravestones) and as many as 11 ancestors on the Mayflower (out of 110 survivors), all were sinners. Not sure about this “saint/sinner” dichotomy. AFAIK, Pilgrim theology was pretty much orthodox Reformed, with double pre-destination meaning that there was the concept of the Elect of God. But I don’t think it was ever a belief that the Elect were/are free from sin, except in the sense of Baptism and original sin. For example the Westminster Confession Chapt 11: “4. God did, from all eternity, decree to justify all the elect, and Christ did, in the fullness of time, die for their sins, and rise again for their justification: nevertheless, they are not justified, until the Holy Spirit doth, in due time, actually apply Christ unto them. 5. God doth continue to forgive the sins of those that are justified; and, although they can never fall from the state of justification, yet they may, by their sins, fall under God’s fatherly displeasure, and not have the light of his countenance restored unto them, until they humble themselves, confess their sins, beg pardon, and renew their faith and repentance.” What is missing from the discussion is the politics. Bear in mind that the King of England was the head of the Church of England (CoE) and any attempt to create a church based on your own religious ideas was not only dangerous but viewed as contempt for the monarchy and could easily land you in jail or worse. Thus, for example, Roman Catholics were automatically targeted because they looked to the Pope for religious guidance rather than the king who at the time of the Mayflower was King James I. Two groups, the Puritans and Separatists, were prominent. The Puritans wanted reform but they remained within the CoE, as well as England. The Separatists wanted freedom from the CoE, hence the name Separatists, because they saw no reason the king should be involved in religious matters. Facing arrest and persecution, the Separatists first emigrated to Holland where they lived for 12-years. When conditions in Holland became dangerous they succeeded in obtaining a contract from London for a settlement in the new world. The Separatists who left Holland and boarded the Mayflower became known as Pilgrims to distinguish them from the Separatists that remained in Europe. By 1620, Jamestown was a settlement but the Pilgrims wanted their own colony to distance themselves from the king in order to not be persecuted in the new world as they were in England. I think their rebellion against the King of England is worth remembering. Aftonbladet tells us that assisted dying is on the docket in England and its captive nation, Wales. The headline is: “British Parliament votes on euthanasia” Two thoughts: — For whom? And will there be less parading around by the members in silly costumes with props like maces? — Will anyone notice if the brain-dead English elite is euthanized? I think that we all know that assistance in dying has gone on since time immemorial. Pneumonia is called the old-man’s friend. There is a debate in Italy as to exactly what women in Sardinia who took on the roles of an abbacadora did in easing death. The irony here is that people now want to schedule their deaths. PS: Of course, zombies exist in the U.S. of A., too. Steny Hoyer, at the age of 172, was just returned to the Congress. I don’t subscribe to the idea that the voters are stupid, but I sure would like to know what kind of stun drugs are in the moo juice in southern Maryland. Tsk. It will never be the old and powerful who are urged and encouraged to ‘go.’ It will be the inconvenient, the old powerless and costly, the politically problematic who urged (maybe even pushed) to go. Simple look at what is happening in Canada. In the UK, if this passes, watch the push on the disabled or costly old people to ‘go’ as a civic duty to save the NHS. You no doubt think I’m kidding or wildly exaggerating. Reminds me of the Reichs Ministry of Racial Purity and its campaign to ‘normalize’ suicide and “assisted” suicide. All done in the interests of “The Greater Good.” When I read or hear that, I know that I should get out of there as quickly as possible. No ‘Good’ can come of it. Aktion-4 does have that neoliberal feel about it. Much of the propaganda over the “life unworthy of life” was over how much it cost the state to care for someone who was disabled. Note, the argument was not that it was unaffordable to care for the disabled, but rather that it was just expensive. Thank you, JBird4049. As someone raised in the Christian tradition of life, the idea that their are some peoples’ “life unworthy of life” is abhorrent to me on basic principles. See also the medieval Christian hospitallers (from whence comes the modern hospital idea) of charities care for the ill. Throw the ill outside the town’s gate to die, or care for them as our fellow humans. I haven’t seen any evidence of actual oversight in Canada. And if there is any, it is always post mortem… Israeli scorpion gotta 🦂 https://x.com/RaniaKhalek/status/1862397943195562124 https://thecradle.co/articles-id/27889 That article says that Hezbollah are waiting for the Lebanese army to deploy but the army itself has no illusions what the Israelis are all about. Several times during the past few weeks the Israelis deliberately murdered troops of the Lebanese army with an airstrike for no reason whatsoever. The commander of Lebanon’s Armed Forces has just briefed the government on their plans for deployment but he also refused to go into any detail or say where Lebanese soldiers would have their barracks. And that can only be because he is not willing to show his plans to the Israelis. They are quite capable of bombing a barracks full of Lebanese troops on the grounds that they are not effective enough in disarming Hezbollah forces as a sort of message- https://thecradle.co/articles/beirut-in-the-dark-about-lebanese-armys-deployment-plan-for-south-lebanon-report The AP report on Cyprus becoming a member of NATO is like some letter from some fantasy land. Cyprus is a well-kept mess for the convenience of the bigger states involved. Note the mention of Turkey having 35,000 in the occupied / breakaway north. This is on a small island with a total population of roughly one million. From WIkipedia: “The Turkish invasion, the ensuing occupation and the declaration of independence by the TRNC have been condemned by United Nations resolutions, which are reaffirmed by the Security Council every year.[126]” Meanwhile, the final paragraph is a piece of self-defeat: “Cyprus’ Andreas Papandreou air base on its southwestern edge is currently hosting a U.S. Marine contingent and a number of V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft prepositioned to assist in potential evacuations from nearby Lebanon and elsewhere.” I’m taken aback that this base is named after socialist politician Andreas Papandreou. Natch, there is no mention of the U.K. extraterritorial carved-out bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. So Cyprus is just a little Ukraine waiting to happen. Can’t see the Turks voting to let Cyprus into NATO. If it happened, that Greek part of Cyprus would be quickly overrun with NATO bases for troops and ships and would become a festung in the eastern Mediterranean. And that would mean that all sorts of pressure could be brought to bear on the Turkish part of the island, even though they are in NATO as well, and maybe forcing some sort of deal on them. That is one headache that the Turks do not need. Re: Turkey Propaganda Word on the street was that turkey outside Wilmington, NC was $0.29 / lb., so maybe that was the ‘Farm Bureau’ price. Somehow I doubt that was the price at Whole Foods. My better half bought a turkey the day before Thanksgiving for around that amount per pound, which was a heavily discounted sale price. Normally you see that price the day after, but maybe they hadn’t sold as briskly ahead of time as the store expected. She also just paid $5.00 for a dozen of the cheap eggs. Organic/cage free were quite a bit more. I showed those stats to my MIL who cooked dinner yesterday. Her dinner for 20 was well over the $116.00 the Farm Bureau estimates. Ian Welsh is clear and to the point. I have nothing else to add except that he’s spot on. The resistance will be picked apart one by one. Not so sure about that. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis have just had their a**** handed to them by Hezbollah. Remember, Hezbollah has their base in the Lebanese people and if they had let the massacres by the Israelis to continue, would have led to the loss of support of their base which is why the – temporary – truce. Hezbollah has used a fair number of their rockets up but they made to make sure that the really good stuff was kept stored. As it is, the north of Israel remains unstable and people are afraid to move back there which will roil Israeli politics. And five IDF divisions and more have been badly mauled by Hezbollah with thousands of Israeli casualties. If this is an Israeli victory, then it is a Pyrrhic victory. Maybe Welsh hasn’t been keeping up on current events but the Israelis The current events indicate that the Syrians are just having their a**** handed back to them by an international force of jihadists amply supplied by Turkey and supported with judicious aerial attacks by Israel, and that the Palestinians are slowly but surely being exterminated without reprieve. As for Iran, it definitely does not want to be involved in a full-fledged war. The only ones possibly crazy enough to continue engaging in military operations are the Yemenis — but for how long if nobody else does? Their supplies of missiles and drones are not inexhaustible. Things are therefore not looking good at all for the Near-Eastern enemies of Israel and the USA. Thus, Israel has a not negligible probability to secure a victory — costly, prohibitively so perhaps, pyrrhic even, but a victory nevertheless. The interviewer here (Ali Alizadeh) said that there are reports that there are 10,000 Turks fighting for Israel in Gaza. The u of houston professor Fadi Kafeety did not comment on that specifically. How Yemen Became a Rising Power in West Asia? A Conversation with Fadi Kafeety https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeIR2TIHljU has anyone else heard anything about that? If the ceasefire holds it will be a victory for Israel – That may be true but, anyone, or, group, being successful in genocide and massive human rights violations – that’s not something, in my mind, to be victorious or successful about. Assuredly the dimension of time will prove it short term and disastrous – but hey, why speculate about the future and it’s outcome when the now is the deal. What risks being utterly disastrous in my mind is a world in which genocide becomes normalised and international law is dead. If Israel and the US axis get away with it, that’s what we’ll get. Harris losing was a small victory but this is the main risk for our future as a species. E.U. Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W).

Not a Coastie, but there are various authorities for boarding. See in particular Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation Numb in India, part 7: Land of gloop Sam Kriss. Trust me, worth a read. A lovely read and thanks for the reminder of how good a writer Sam Kriss can be. I used to be a regular reader and somehow he fell out of my regular subscriptions (too many good things out there to keep up with). Not many westerner writers travelling in Asia provide genuinely new insights, but he is one of them. I’ve never been to Kerala, I just know of it from the lovely patient Keralan nurses who cared for my parents in years past. It has long been recognised as one of the best run Indian States, although the competition isn’t all that high. Its also a good reminder of the incredible diversity of India – there are plenty of chunks of that country as big as many other countries which are very different in culture and politics from what we usually think of as ‘India’ – the many cultures of the Himalayan foothills and plateaus as one example. There are also a surprising number of hot wars going on at any one time in the sub-continent, usually entirely unreported, even in India. The question of why India seems to have faltered while China surges is one that seems to be consuming both Indians and Chinese these days – my Chinese media feeds are full of mocking commentary on India. Some Indians seem quietly confident their country is at the beginning of a renaissance, others have their exit plans well prepared. I guess it all depends on what you think of Modi. Assuming climate change doesn’t make the sub-continent uninhabitable, its not too late, there are plenty of models in Asia for late take-offs economically – Vietnam and Indonesia in particular seem to have hit that acceleration stage and both had similar problems to India. India has its success stories. It has some of the biggest companies in the world, a vast amount of domestic talent, nuclear weapons, hypersonic missiles, and satellites. As well as…. all the other things we know about. But sometime around the mid 1990’s it started to fall very far behind its most obvious peer nation, in terms of raw GNP, human development and in tech. Many a book and article has been written on the topic, you can pretty much pick your theory as to why India has fallen behind according to your particular prejudice. Too much capitalism, too little capitalism, too big a state, too weak a state, colonialism, the wrong type of colonialism, cultural diversity, lack of it, the caste system, paternalistic family companies, laziness (the latter often opined by upper caste Indians), and so on. I’m something of an geographic determinist. Big continental or island States that succeed economically tend to have certain things in common – big navigable rivers or inland seas connecting natural harbours, easy to access mineral riches, good soils. India lacks many of these – it has few natural harbours, its rivers are not suitable for much transport and with some localised exceptions its soils are generally poor and unproductive without intensive labour inputs. It has plenty of coal and other minerals, but it is generally low quality and difficult to access and refine. The difficult topography of inland India always seemed to lead to lots of little feudal states historically, which proved easy for outside conquerors, with plenty of those from north of the Himalaya preceding the British. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_God_of_Small_Things The God of Small Things, a Booker award winner takes place in Kerala. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_We_Imagine_as_Light All We Imagine as Light, a Cannes award winner, follows to Kerala nurses trying to make it in Mumbai. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism_in_India Kerala is the only surviving communist state in India.

There is no single tragedy at the heart of Arundhati Roy’s devastating first novel. Although ”The God of Small Things” opens with memories of a family grieving around a drowned child’s coffin, there are plenty of other intimate horrors still to come, and they compete for the reader’s sympathy with the furious energy of cats in a sack. Yet the quality of Ms. Roy’s narration is so extraordinary — at once so morally strenuous and so imaginatively supple — that the reader remains enthralled all the way through to its agonizing finish. This ambitious meditation on the decline and fall of an Indian family is part political fable, part psychological drama, part fairy tale, and it begins at its chronological end, in a landscape of extravagant ruin. When 31-year-old Rahel Kochamma returns to Ayemenem House, her former home in the south Indian state of Kerala, its elegant windows are coated with filth and its brass doorknobs dulled with grease; dead insects lie in the bottom of its empty vases. The only animated presence in the house seems to be great-aunt Baby Kochamma’s new television set — in front of which she and her servant sit day after day, munching peanuts. Rahel has come back to Ayemenem not to see her great-aunt, however, but because she has heard that her twin brother, Estha, has unexpectedly returned. Estha and Rahel were once inseparable, but now they have been apart for almost 25 years — ever since the winter of 1969, when their English cousin, Sophie Mol, drowned in the river with their grandmother’s silver thimble in her fist. ”Perhaps it’s true that things can change in a day,” Ms. Roy’s narrator muses. ”That a few dozen hours can affect the outcome of whole lifetimes. And that when they do, those few dozen hours, like the salvaged remains of a burned house — the charred clock, the singed photograph, the scorched furniture — must be resurrected from the ruins and examined.

What caused the boy named Estha to stop talking? What sent his twin sister, Rahel, into exile in the United States? Why did their beautiful mother, Ammu, end up dying alone in a grimy hotel room? What killed their English cousin, Sophie Mol? And why has a ”whiff of scandal” involving sex and death come to surround their bourgeois family? While such questions may sound crudely melodramatic, they provide the narrative architecture of a novel that turns out to be as subtle as it is powerful, a novel that is Faulknerian in its ambitious tackling of family and race and class, Dickensian in its sharp-eyed observation of society and character… A millennia-long tradition of organized martial arts may have helped them retain their cultural and economic identity. Kalaripayattu. Kerala is the most lovely part of India imho. I’ve been going to India on holiday almost every year for 20 years or so, because I love it so much. Last year I decided to fly up to Ahmedabad on my way home to spend a few days. I can’t really recommend it. Only place I’ve been where the Hindutva vibe was too much to take. Good thali though and the Gandhi ashram was worth the hour it took to visit. But Kerala is fab. The ayurvedic treatment you can get there is very reasonably priced and they are not dogmatic or trying to convert you to some new lifestyle but rather help you to get better. Kochi is a lovely little city and Thiruvanathpuram (Trivandrum) is a sort of quirky state capital with a giant wooden maharajah’s palace next to a huge temple and very walkable. But the best part is just to get out to the backwaters and eat a Keralan fish curry, washed down with coconut toddy… My mind makes an association between Sam Kriss’ gloop and Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop. You’re welcome. Re: ‘organ damage’ As a cardiologist with Long Covid and a fan of this blog permit me to say that it’s impossible to know what to make of the “mild atrial irregularity” without knowing the age of the patient or the nature of the “irregularity”. Millions of people had mild atrial issues long before COVID — and it correlates with age and various other items like hypertension, alcohol consumption patterns, etc. Atrial arrhythmia is one of the most overdiagnosed and overtreated cardiac ‘conditions’, and a source of much business for the electrophysiology labs that have sprouted up all over the country in the last 20 years. That said, since so much of the phenotype of Long Covid runs parallel with aging in general, it wouldn’t surprise me if an increase in atrial issues were one of the post-acute things we see. Still, I wouldn’t put it high on the list of things those of us with Long Covid need to fret about.

Is there any evidence for that belief? “Xi sits in Beijing. In Moscow, Putin. In Washington, Trump is on the way. You can call them crazy guys. They don’t want good. Hope lies with von der Leyen in Brussels.” Absurd and offensive.

Ultimate Irony Comes as Taliban Asks Russia’s Help To Evade US Sanctions, Closing 50-year Loop of Violence Antiwar.com (Kevin W) The US had spent billions arming freedom fighters to fight the Russians out of Afghanistan, … No it didn’t. US had intentionaly spent gazillions arming extremists of all sorts all around the world, knowing very well what they are, and rebranding them as freedom fighters in order to sell the lie to idi*ts. If the Russians manage to bring Afghanistan in from the cold like they are doing for North Korea, then maybe that country can develop all those mineral reserves that the Pentagon tried to use to justify the occupation and rebuild their country. Just don’t forget the real reason why the occupation- https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1547752702511263745 I once read an interview of a warlord from the Northern Alliance which I hope I had bookmarked, but no such luck, so I have no proof. But in that interview the man clearly declared that had they (mujahideen) known what would follow for Afghanistan, they certainly would have not fought “the shuravi”. I guess Taliban learned from all those mistakes. Andrew Korybko has an interesting take on Russia’s strategy re Afghanistan. The Kremlin is playing the long game, as usual. https://asiatimes.com/2024/11/russias-grand-geo-economic-plan-a-step-closer-in-afghanistan/ “Russian Ruble Collapses As Putin’s Economy in Trouble” I think that Newsweek are getting their hopes up. I don’t think that the sanctions are causing the inflation in Russia so much as the Russian economy is overheating due to it’s expansion as a wartime economy. A shortage of workers is not helping things either. Inside Russia the ruble is not a problem as that is what the workers are getting paid in so if Newsweek is hoping, like Biden, that the ruble will become rubble they may have to wait a while. Just wait until these Russian collapse stories meet the China collapse stories and have babies together. Maybe with some “at what cost” polycule added in. The data other than an artificial currency value are fine. While what matters is currency support from China, which is there along with general economic support. China is by far the largest world economy and open and inviting to Russian exchange. Russians as a number of other peoples can come and go in China with no visas and Hainan could not be a better winter refuge; even a free port refuge. Russia has made China more than energy self-sufficient, and the Russian and Chinese economies are complementary in important ways beyond energy. https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/weo-database/2024/October/weo-report?c=223,924,132,134,532,534,536,158,546,922,112,111,&s=PPPGDP,PPPSH,&sy=2000&ey=2023&ssm=0&scsm=1&scc=0&ssd=1&ssc=0&sic=0&sort=country&ds=.&br=1 October 15, 2024 Gross Domestic Product based on purchasing-power-parity (PPP) for Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, United Kingdom and United States, 2000-2023 2023 China ( 33,552) United States ( 27,721) India ( 14,620) Russia ( 6,512) Japan ( 6,398) Germany ( 5,876) Brazil ( 4,457) Indonesia ( 4,335) France ( 4,211) United Kingdom ( 4,137) With a weak Ruble, Russian gas exports will be even cheaper in comparison to what the suckers EU will pay for strong-dollar US LNG. The ruble-Euro exchange rate on 23.02.2022 was 90.88, today it is 114.31; this is not a particularly significant change after nearly three years, especially in light of all the fireworks that have taken place. RWA’s summary is interesting. I would add one more thing, based on my 20+ years of experience importing into Russia. Every year without fail, as the new year approached, the ruble would depreciate vs the $ and Euro. Always. This drove our accountants crazy, as it made it more expensive for us to buy $/Euro (usually Euro) to pay our EU suppliers before the end of the year, and because we were pricing in Euro (though selling in rubles) it also drove up our ruble profits (i.e., more income taxes to pay). And every year, after the holidays ended after 15 January, the ruble would appreciate (usually back to its previous level). Then as now, two factors were at play: higher seasonal demand for $/Euro (Russians preparing to vacation abroad, retailers buying imported products for the holiday shopping season, trading companies settling their foreign accounts payable before the close of the year), and the Russian government gently leaning on the scales to weaken the ruble (in order to boost corporate income tax revenues across the board, a nice holiday gift for the upcoming year’s budget). I think there is nothing new under the sun. Let’s see what the exchange rates look like at the end of January 2025 before jumping to conclusions. Since January 2000, the real exchange value of Russian currency has increased by 55.7%: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=mvBn January 15, 2018 Real Broad Effective Exchange Rate for Russia, 2000-2024 (Indexed to 2000) I don’t see why Russians should be too concerned about currency fluctuations. Free floating currencies bounce all over the place for a variety of reasons. Over the last 25 years the Canadian dollar has swung from 68 cents US to 1.10 $ US and back down again. It doesn’t make much difference at the retail level for consumers but has caused serious problems for exporters when the CAD was high. Many factories have closed as a result. I should add Canada is a net energy exporter, as is Russia. For a net importer a low currency could cause serious problems.

It is required to specify a rate of change for every specific domain. Rationally progressive means embracing progress by accepting a certain rate of change deemed optimal. Too high a rate of change cancels the gains from previous mutations; while too slow a change leads to misfitness. : Pandit, Pradhan, & van Schaik: Figure 6 shows the number of feasible classes as a function of the skew in power, σ, and the original group size, N(0). … the number of feasible classes has a very weak dependence on group size. Thus, for the N(0) in the typical range of human group sizes, the number of classes only depends on σ. Intriguingly, at lower σ we expect to find more classes… The size of the upper class is largest for σ → 0 (~ half of the group), thus potentially leading to a large number of middle classes. Power. That’s a word Fazi doesn’t hone in on. Rather applicable to the tremendous wealth inequality of an oligarchy. Thanks.

Vessels Surround Anchored Chinese Ship After Cables Are Severed in Baltic Sea New York Times (Kevin W). How is this detention not an illegal seizure, aka piracy, or at least illegal interference? From the article” “But U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that the cables were not cut deliberately” It not something I’m up to date on, but international law on undersea cables is mostly based on the Paris Convention of 1888 (yes, thats right, 1888). In simple terms, there is an obligation on ships not do do anything that could break a cable, and its up to national governments to enforce the law on vessels registered in its country. Military ships do have the right under Article X to board a ship suspected of having broken a cable so even if the breaking was accidental, stopping and checking the Chinese ship would be lawful under the law of the sea. This Atlantic Council (booo!) article says otherwise-stating your aforementioned treaty doesn’t provide guarantees and protections for undersea cables. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/content-series/hybrid-warfare-project/international-law-doesnt-adequately-protect-undersea-cables-that-must-change/ They are not really contradictory. The right to check a vessel under any flag that is suspected of causing damage is established in Article X, but its always been ambiguous about what rights and obligations apply after the stop occurs, especially if a State actor is suspected to be involved in the damage or the ‘home’ country of the vessel involved refuses to co-operate. There has also been questions raised about other types of cable, specifically transnational electric cables, as they are not explicitly covered by the convention. High profile stops are rare, but on a more local scale in seas like the Irish Sea or Dogger Bank, stop and checks in international waters by military vessels of fishing boats suspected of dredging too near to cables happens all the time (fishermen regularly complain about this) – it doesn’t matter where the fishing boat is registered, its a well established right. It just gets ambiguous when you are dealing with contested areas as in the South China Sea or if the suspect is a military vessel -, that’s what the article is about. Re: British Parliament votes on euthanasia: I immediately thought “well they’ve mined “1984” for all it’s worth and are turning to a US novel, “Make Room Make Room”upon which the movie “Soylent Green” was based. On checking novel’s origin , some stats in storyline: Set in mid 1999-New Years day 2000, World population ~7B (seemingly indicative of extreme overpopulation!) and NYC 34M. Food shortage driven by resource hoarding by rich is a major factor in social upheaval . Euthanasia becomes a protein source… Never gonna Happen! Any thoughts on the idea of a western sourced false flag operation in an allied state? The London camera thing is weird but no where near convincing. And would London even be the best target? Is there a euro state where the people aren’t fully on board with project Ukraine and a massive event would act to pull the West together? Perhaps blowing up the Hague would accomplish multiple things at the same time? First, because of the UK’s role in NATO’s war on Russia, London will be one of Russia’s three most obvious targets, two of which are in the UK, amongst all the possible targets throughout the Collective West; second, the British security services are best placed and most motivated to organise a false flag; third, the UK’s Parliament and population are incredibly gullible (note the ease with which the ridiculous explanation of the Skripal affair has been accepted); and fourth, it was planned before the Oresnik strike when the various intelligence services still thought that the public would accept that Russia would use a nuke. The problem the West has now is that Russia could take out ALL the decision-making centres (and population centres) in Europe without nukes and the only possible source of effective (that is, nuclear) retaliation would be the US, and that would be disastrous for the US, so the US would consider Article 5, as it is obliged to do, and say “No thanks, old buddies. The war against Russia is now strictly a European affair”. There was a pamphlet about the decline of the UK published by Encounter magazine, a CIA front, in the fifties entitled, as I remember, “Suicide of a Nation” (God knows where it is among my shelves). The title was, of course, metaphorical. The question now is whether the Brits are prepared to play a game of Russian roulette with all chambers loaded. Unfortunately, the answer will most likely be that the ideologically driven incompetents who’ve been running this war beyond the reach of sanity will say, “Yes, please. I’ll go first, so pass me the gun”. I have to admit that I did not understand how virulently various interests in the UK hated the Russians. I’ve been amazed to watch my UK friends post meme after meme describing how awful the Russians are and how we should just annihilate them all. It makes me think that western leaders will only be happy when Gaza is full of ghosts and Russia is a graveyard. I seem to have missed some crucial Britishness classes because I have never felt this way. And I really don’t see where my compatriots have got this from. However, I did have a New Year’s party in Dec 2022 which nearly ruined a thirty year friendship group when it turned out that two of us (me + gold trader) took Russia’s side and two of us (particle physics professor and healthcare informatics / pandemic data analysis PhD) took the Ukraine’s. We were shocked by their fact-free convictions. We have agreed not to speak of it again! Actually, if you do a YT search about the CCD cameras in London; you’ll find many videos stating that they have been off-line for the past 85 days or more, not just 24 hours. There’s been no official explanation as to why, but then again, what reporter nowadays would dare to ask the question? I say, “off-line” because the theory is that they’re still working, just no longer accessible to the public (nor to the regular police either, for some reason). Commenters on these videos have stated that a similar thing has happened in Manchester, and I believe Bristol. Apparently, MI-5/6 has form on this because the CCD cameras around London were supposedly not operating on the day of 7/7 either. I’m just repeating what the YTubers have been saying on this last bit, but they’re all pretty insistent on this. Who knows what the truth is anymore? For anyone who wants to have some real fun; do a YT search about those drones that have been showing up at UK airports. The false flag theory is plausible but if the goal is all-out war with Russia, western war planners once again fail to take everything into account. I, an average guy living an average life, know for near certain that a co-ordinated allied attack on Russia would be met with a similar mobilisation from China. It’s just obvious that China’s best interests are Russia not falling into western hands and getting used in turn to isolate China. This looks like it’s going to be a case of dog catching car. https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/29/world/europe/uk-assisted-dying-bill-vote.html November 29, 2024 After Emotional Debate, British Lawmakers Vote to Legalize Assisted Dying In a landmark decision on Friday, Parliament voted in favor of allowing assisted suicide for some terminally ill people under strict conditions.

In Canada where we have had Medically Assistance in Dying (MAID) for a number of years there have been a variety of steps allowing people suffering greatly with no hope of recovery the relief of MAID. About 7500 people avail themselves of this merciful way of leaving their suffering behind, able to leave this world in the company of loved ones. I’m 72 and fully support the legislation. The British people overwhelmingly support the legislation as shown by a poll published in The Independent yesterday.

A Bird Flu Pandemic Would Be One of the Most Foreseeable Catastrophes in History – Zeynep Tufekci And it is not paywalled, either, which is extremely rare at NY Times. Rest assured, after H5N1 hits, she’ll be minimizing yet another Pandemic, if it turns out people don’t turn blue and explode. None the less, clearly some subset of the elite are rightly freaking out. Just a few weeks ago, a pig in a backyard farm in Oregon was found to have bird flu. It seems to have gotten it from sick poultry on the same farm. Pigs cause extra worry because they are considered to be ideal mixing vessels for various animal flu viruses to adapt and spread among humans. Last week, the virus was found in a flock of ducks at a pet fair in Hawaii, the one state that hadn’t previously found a case — likely transmitted by wild birds, which continue to spread the illness far and wide. Of the 34 individuals who had been exposed at that pet fair, including 13 who had respiratory symptoms, all were offered voluntary testing. Five declined. A teenager in Canada was infected, and the virus showed some key mutations that bring it closer to adapting to spread among humans. This outbreak has so far been mostly mild in humans, but historically it has been deadly, and further mutations could make it so again. That Canadian is in critical condition, unable to breathe independently. There’s also an infected child in California who was not known to have come into contact with any sick animals at all, which raises the terrifying possibility that he got it from another human being. And the virus levels in the wastewater in several states keep spiking. We’ve definitely arrived at the bucket-up phase of this. One thing I keep in mind about the “Collective Biden” is that the husk alone has had Covid 3 times, Dr Jill has had it several times and Blinken, Sullivan and the rest have had it several times as well. This may have something to do with why the USA is now in a shooting War with Russia and it does not bode well for the future. Maybe we’ll get lucky… This was also reported by TASS but no sign in mainstream media in the states… https://news-pravda.com/world/2024/11/28/886216.html “Up to 40 specialists from the USA were destroyed”: The Ministry of Defense revealed details of the retaliatory strike against Ukraine The Ministry of Defense told what losses the Ukrainian side suffered after Russia’s retaliatory strike against attacks with long-range ATACMS missiles. According to the ministry, on November 28, the Russian Armed Forces launched a comprehensive attack on defense and industrial facilities, as well as the energy infrastructure of Ukraine. In addition, on November 25 and 26, Iskander ballistic missiles destroyed ATACMS launchers, installations with experimental samples of Grom-2 missiles, as well as a transport and loading vehicle of the Neptune anti-ship complex. In addition, during the attack, Russian missiles landed directly at the headquarters of the Main Intelligence Directorate “Kraken” in Kharkov. As a result of the strike, up to 40 foreign specialists were eliminated, most of whom were specialists from the United States. From A strange new climate era is beginning to take hold It will be those investments — and the energy choices of up-and-coming developing nations — that will determine the future of the planet. So WaPo basically blames developing nations, Trump tariffs, AI, whatever, the blame directed everywhere except at the capitalist class itself. No, the solution to climate is to terminate capitalism. Instead we’re all gonna burn alive. Without a serious discussion of what all of this energy usage is in service of, and what people really need to live a decent life, there won’t be any worthwhile progress on avoiding an extinction level event. Good stuff. As much as I like the the idea of Putin as Cobra Commander holding the West hostage, it makes about as much sense as the more hyperbolic claims about the Oreshnik. We already have decades of research and experimental data on fairly similar cases: 1) On the low end, large sabot penetrators (tungsten or depleted uranium): 10kg at Mach 5-6 2) On the high end, HEAT warhead penetrators (copper): 1kg at Mach 15-25 Neither of these cause destruction by mystical waves of pressure or heat. The damage is purely kinetic: direct impact and spalled fragments of whatever they hit. A 100kg* penetrator travelling at Mach 10 will cause proportionately scaled damage–but it is not remotely comparable to a nuclear weapon. At least, that seems like the safest assumption unless we see dramatic evidence to the contrary. * The throw weight of a Bulava at max range is 1,000 kg bus and warheads, but let’s be generous and assume something with more weight and less range. (This was meant as a reply to AG’s GI Joe clip, but it looks like I missed it). Since you mention COBRA – your post could either be about Covid OR Oreshnik. p.s. Did Putin not state that several Oreshniks could cause as much destruction as a tactical nuke? If so I don´t know what value of a nuke´s powers he was referring to. Fission is a different beast altogether. But with conventional destructive capabalities added? Yes, that’s right. Let’s do some rough math (hopefully correctly) and see where this might be coming from: A small nuke = a kiloton of TNT = 4.2E12 joules A 100kg* penetrator traveling at Mach 10 = 5.9E8 36 penetrators in an Oreshnik = 2.1E10 100 Oreshniks (or just 10 Oreshniks if it is a big missile) = 2.1E12 It seems that Putin is doing a sleight of hand that several others have done to impress the folks at home. You add up the joules of energy from a vast number of penetrators with such and such weight and velocity and eventually you get an impressive number. But it doesn’t add up to quite as much practical destructive force as the number implies. And even then, Putin must have been using numbers from a small tactical nuke. * 100kg is just a guess. If the missile is small, they couldn’t be much heavier, but a big short ranged missile could carry 10x more weight. What do you want to destroy? Counter force or counter value? Critical issue is accuracy of penetrators. If you have 18 hard targets (assign 2 “penetrators” to each) spread around the area of Hiroshima, you can achieve results equal to a 20 kt bombs. Would as air burst have gotten deep vaults? Jeffrey Lewis on TWITTER tried to ridicule the Oreshnik a bit by describing that buildings that were not targeted but were next to where the factotry was located had suffered cracks. Thus it was a bad weapon and the claims of accuracy fraudulent. I don´t understand these people. Why do scientists have to act like propagandists. It reminds of the German nuclear phyisicists when they were interned in Farm Hall in 1945 and were mocking US and others as not able to pull off a nuke before August 6th shell-shocked them… Kinetic penetrators were never about sheer energy, but about focusing it in a small area. They can get much deeper than surface explosion can. Comparing just energies of different projectile types is like comparing just GDPs of countries. Here’s a math problem. How big would a surface detonation have to be, in order to destroy underground bunker that one Oreshnik kinetic penetrator can? re: Project Zeus Did Zeus eat hazelnuts? I don´t think so. They are not your typical Greek flora, or are they? Most of the calculations I’ve seen compare the energy delivered by the mach 10 mass to that of kilotons of TNT, like nukes. Putin claimed that the temperature of the mass was 4000° which is above the melting point of most metals, and the plasma envelope around it was evident. That added thermal energy, and the dynamics of a plasma shielded molten blob might lead to some interesting effects not obvious from more mundane experiments. I agree with you that this is more than it seems. It is only a closed system in a vacuum. Passing through the atmosphere the air resistance creates the friction that generates this heat. That is likely adding to the net effect of the explosion but not figured into the equation. Metallurgists know about the molecular changes that take place above critical temperatures making some stainless steels magnetic and some non-magnetic. When tool steels (normally cubic-centered structures) reach critical temperatures they become austenitic (face-centered cubic grain structure) and lose their magnetism. Unknown changes are probably generated by this heat to the unknown substance of these rods, but it has been tested in Russia. Deferring to people who have practical experience in this is not magical thinking but pragmatic. I have seen several suggestions that the process at the end is magnetohydrodynamics, no official word yet. The scientist in charge is saying that currently they operate at 2,200deg. centigrade but theory lets them hope to get it up to 3,000 deg centigrade. i.e. Mach 15 @ Wisker. About the only realistic assessment I’ve read here. One has only to look at the published pictures of the above ground buildings at Yukhmash to see the sturdy Soviet era buildings have hardly “turned to dust”. Some caught fire from the white hot heat of passing projectiles. Subsequent descriptions of clusters of projectile holes in the ground where they missed a building have turned up. Nobody seems to have dug down to have a look at the “destruction” below. Hardly worth the bother. But, the general belief here is that somehow the projectiles from Oreshnik have kiloton nuclear bomb power. I’ll repeat again for the more dense folks here who seem to believe in magic: The final energy of the rod projectiles cannot exceed that of the chemical energy released by the missile’s rocket motors. Period. It is a closed system and the Law of Conservation of Energy applies. If 40 tonnes of rocket fuel, expended all at once, like in blowing up on the launch pad, is equivalent to several kilotons of TNT, I’m a monkey’s uncle. But if fairy tales make you happy, so be it. And the same goes for Putin. The advantage of Oreshnik is the super fast delivery time of an actual nuke on target from a mobile launcher. Now that indeed is a concern for Western “strategists” who might be awake. If indeed, any competent ones are on the job who are not beholden to the party line like MSM journalists who are unconsciously adept at writing “stuff” that pleases their overlords. And no, I am not making shit up. Others are. I don’t know where people are getting kilotons out of this weapon. I’ve seen, and my own crude calculations produce, multi-ton-level per 75-100kg munition, with that energy focused in a cone along the direction of travel like a large hammer blow. The highest I’ve seen is 11 tons per munition, and I suspect that’s too big, although the Ukrainians estimated velocity at 11.0 to 11.4 km/s, a lot higher than other reports, and energy is velocity squared. Assuming no more than 10 tons tnt equivalent/munition, that’s less than 360 tons tnt per device. That’s still a lot. What’s even more interesting is how tight the sheaf of the impact appears to be. If that’s the case, this weapon is incredibly precise (if not accurate) especially for its velocity. Whatever is below the impact points is going to be crushed. Explosives used in that tight of a sheaf impacting within a second of each other might cause less damage due to interference, whether that be due to phase cancellation or blowing up the following warheads or other factors. This is an interesting weapon system for sure, but probably not even close to kiloton yield even in aggregate. That’s still enough to utterly destroy something on the receiving end, and do so efficiently. Your point is valid and I am sceptical of these claims but should we also consider something like “energy flux”, i.e. the impact is vertical and focused in a narrow cone around the falling projectile, rather than a spherical explosion, increasing the damage in a directional way? If it is focused in a cone with 1/10th the radius of a spherical explosion, the “flux” is ~ 100x greater (I am modelling it as a passing through a flat circle rather than a small spherical surface). Michael von der Schulenburg with acid comment on EU in BERLINER ZEITUNG: Ukraine War: New EU Resolution Brings Europe to the Brink of World War III https://archive.is/wwzU3 Finale: This resolution is a document full of hatred, panic and hysteria – a shameful expression of irresponsibility and a lack of empathy for the many victims of such war hysteria. There is nothing in it for us Europeans to be proud of. Fortunately, this resolution is unlikely to have any direct political impact on the war in Ukraine. The European Parliament has simply demonstrated once again that it behaves like a “dummy decision-maker” on many issues – in this case, fortunately for all of us. For me, who has always been an ardent supporter of the European idea, it is painful to listen to the debates of a war-mongering and hate-filled parliamentary majority. I then ask myself: what kind of monster have we created with the EU? I believe this is the full text of the resolution: JOINT MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on reinforcing EU’s unwavering support to Ukraine against Russia’s war of aggression and the increasing military cooperation between North Korea and Russia This is just an embarrassing display of political, economic and social delusion and, as mi mam used to say, “Fine words don’t butter no parsnips”. But stupidity can elicit a tree full of hazelnuts. Good multi language pun! It is a monster which will either remain subservient to the US, or will gradually implode and it’s members will part company with each other, or both; or it could simply recognise reality and either implode or remains in some form as abstract in it’s realty as it’s model, the Holy Roman Empire, accepting that it is the inferior in terms of it’s relationships with Russia and China – on whom it is dependent if it’s inhabitants are to enjoy a standard of living anywhere approaching the standard they enjoy today which, of course, for most people means a standard lower than that of 2021. Just started reading that wonderful post about Kerala. A thing about it that kind of lights me up a bit, and I think may not be mentioned in the piece itself, is it’s proximity to the upcoming north/south transport corridor that will bypass Suez and go all the way to Russia, IIRC. The port of Chabahar in Iran is where it will start. This looks set to be an interesting corner of the world as the near future unfolds. I’m looking forward to watching how things develop.

"The U.S market will continue to do well. As you know, tech has already done well. So, what I would do is focus on companies and industries that are taking advantage of technology to improve productivity," the chairman of the Mobius Emerging Opportunities Fund said in an interview with CNBC last week. U.S.-based companies geared toward China and India, as well as other major emerging market economies, are well positioned, he added. "I focus on those companies that are global in their scope, and producing and exporting and selling in these countries, because that's where the growth will be." Investors should also consider firms taking advantage of what Mobius calls "accelerated information," such as chip manufacturers. "I call AI accelerated information because there's nothing artificial about AI and it's not intelligent. But it's getting more information faster and being able to analyze that information much more effectively," he said. His comments come as emerging markets that produce semiconductors enjoy an economic boom, with Taiwan — which makes most of the advanced chips in circulation — a particular success story. ASEAN countries in Southeast Asia are also enjoying increased foreign investment. Malaysia's focus on chip production, for instance, has seen it become deeply embedded into the global supply chain. Speaking with CNBC at the October IMF annual meetings in Washington, D.C., Malaysia's central bank governor Abdul Rasheed Ghaffour said the country exports 7% of the world's semiconductors. Mobius says there's "no question" that a tech bubble is on the horizon given the valuations of the so-called Magnificent Seven — a group of Big Tech stocks comprising of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. But although he admitted that some of stock prices had "gone up too fast and too far," he's not concerned. "You must remember that you can't just look at the price-to-earnings ratio, which is the normal measure that people use to evaluate whether an industry or a stock is too expensive, because the growth rate of these companies is so great," he said. Nvidia has been the primary beneficiary of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, with its next-generation AI chip Blackwell now in focus. Shares of the company have nearly tripled so far in 2024 — up more than 170% in the year-to-date — making it the world's most valuable publicly traded company. Some investors worry the AI juggernaut won't be able to keep up the rapid growth, however, although Mobius remains optimistic about the prospects for Nvidia and other Big Tech stocks. "The [Magnificent Seven] earnings are growing at a terrific pace and you've got to look forward that will continue. I'm not so concerned about most of these companies being too expensive, they will continue to do quite well," Mobius added. "And of course, you have new companies coming into the picture that are also benefiting from these changes." Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: The Bambu Lab A1 Mini Changed My Opinion About 3D Printing
URL: https://www.maketecheasier.com/review/bambu-lab-a1-mini/
Time Published: 2024-11-29T01:25:00Z
Full Content:
Sign up for our daily newsletter I’ve watched way too many friends wrestle with 3D printers – endless calibration processes and hours of print settings tweaking just to get a half-decent result. It all seemed like way more trouble than it was worth, and for years, that kept me from even considering buying one myself. But then I discovered the Bambu Lab A1 Mini, and everything changed. When I spotted the Bambu Lab A1 Mini on sale for $200, my interest was immediately piqued by the promise of a plug-and-print experience with high-quality output right out of the box. This hassle-free experience is made possible by a suite of intelligent features that eliminate the typical frustrations of 3D printing. The entire calibration process is fully automated thanks to a network of sensors: it measures the bed level, sets the perfect Z-offset, calibrates the belt tension, and even fine-tunes the vibration compensation before each print. There’s also the Active Flow Rate Compensation system, which actively measures and adjusts the pressure in the nozzle as it prints to eliminate common headaches like blobby corners or inconsistent layers. The compact size was another selling point. At just 347 x 315 x 365 mm, the Bambu Lab A1 Mini has almost exactly the right size for my modest desk setup. Sure, its 180 x 180 x 180 mm build volume isn’t the largest out there, but it’s more than adequate for most of my home printing needs. It’s worth noting that the Bambu Lab also offers an optional A1 Mini-compatible AMS (Automatic Material System) for multi-color printing, but I decided to skip it. As cool as multi-color prints look, the process requires frequent purging of filament when switching colors, which creates a lot of waste. Since my needs for multi-color prints are pretty limited, I couldn’t justify the extra cost and material waste. Convinced that the A1 Mini is worth the price, I placed my order through Bambu Lab’s European store on a Wednesday evening. After a week that felt much longer than usual – thanks to my growing excitement and endless YouTube reviews – a box arrived at my doorstep, and I was ready to unbox my new printer. The A1 Mini came pre-assembled – a welcome departure from the DIY kits I’d watched friends struggle with – and the setup process was refreshingly straightforward. After placing the printer on my desk and removing a few pieces of protective foam, I just needed to attach the spool holder and plug it in. The touchscreen interface walked me through each step with clear instructions that actually made sense. Loading the included sample filament was equally intuitive. The printer guided me through the process on its 2.4-inch touchscreen: insert the filament until the sensor detects it, then tap “Load.” The printer handled everything else automatically, heating up the nozzle and feeding the filament through. When plastic emerged from the nozzle, I knew I was ready to print. Then came the moment of truth: my first Benchy, the little 3D printed tugboat that serves as a standard test print across the 3D printing community. The printer confidently ran through its pre-print calibration routine, checking everything from bed level to belt tension. Then it started printing at a speed that made me nervous – until I saw the results. About 20 minutes later (this includes the time it took the printer to complete its calibration routines), I was holding a nearly perfect Benchy. The layers were clean, the overhangs were smooth, and even the tiny details like the door arch and window frames came out crisp. No stringing, no layer shifts, and no elephant’s foot at the base. Like most major manufacturers of 3D printers, Bambu providers its own slicer software, called Bambu Studio. Those familiar with PrusaSlicer will find Bambu Studio to be instantly familiar, and for a good reason: it’s a direct fork. Indeed, Bambu Lab has taken the well-loved PrusaSlicer framework and enhanced it with features tailored specifically for their printers, such as seamless integration with the AMS system for multi-material printing and optimized profiles for high-speed, high-quality results. Bambu Lab’s own slicer software impressed me from the start with its clean interface and intelligent default settings, but I soon discovered OrcaSlicer (a fork of Bambu Studio) after seeing it repeatedly recommended in online communities. While OrcaSlicer’s standout advantage is its superior compatibility with non-Bambu printers, I personally use it from time to time mainly because it supports some advance print settings that Bambu Studio doesn’t. For instance, I often find myself turning to OrcaSlicer specifically for its mouse ears brim feature – small circular additions to the brim that provide extra adhesion exactly where needed. Like many new 3D printer owners, I needed a practical project to justify the purchase to my skeptical spouse, and our Ikea sofa provided one. You see, it’s low-profile legs created a black hole for toys – anything that rolled under it was effectively lost until our next major furniture-moving cleaning session. This was my chance. Using TinkerCAD (a free, browser-based 3D modeling tool), I designed a set of sleeve-like adapters that could slide over the sofa’s legs while providing mounting points for a wooden barrier. The print took a few hours using Bambu’s black PLA filament, and the results exceeded my expectations. The adapters fit perfectly, and now our living room floor stays toy-free. Encouraged by this success, I started looking for other household challenges to tackle. A broken dishwasher soap dispenser clip? Printed a replacement in 30 minutes. Our oddly-sized shower drain that no standard plug would fit? Designed and printed a custom solution that works better than anything we could have bought. But I have to admit, while practical projects justified the purchase, toys for my kids make up the bulk of my printing these days. This is where Bambu Lab’s MakerWorld website has become an invaluable resource. It’s a community platform that hosts thousands of 3D models, many with pre-configured print profiles specifically optimized for the A1 Mini. My kids have been particularly delighted with the custom Duplo-compatible bricks I’ve printed. The adapters that let them connect their Duplo blocks to wooden Brio train tracks were an instant hit. We’ve also printed specialized pieces like a working crane tower, custom railway switches, and even a replica John Deere tractor in perfect Duplo scale. One of their favorites is a series of elevated train track pieces that let them build more complex railway layouts than what’s possible with standard Duplo tracks. Thanks to the pre-configured profiles on MakerWorld and the A1 Mini’s automated calibration, most prints succeed on the first try and look fantastic without any additional work required. I simply download a model, send it to the printer, and come back a few hours later to find exactly what I wanted. While the A1 Mini has been a remarkably reliable printer, I did encounter two minor issues that were easily solved with, ironically enough, 3D printing. The first quirk was somewhat messy: the printer would occasionally flick bits of purged filament (affectionately known as “filament poop” in the 3D printing community) onto the floor around the printer. A quick search on MakerWorld revealed dozens of community-designed solutions for this problem. I opted for the “Compact Poop Bucket” design, which catches these bits of waste filament neatly and can be easily emptied when full. The sheer number of different catch solutions available is actually quite amusing – whether you want something purely functional or a design that turns the waste collection into a decorative feature, you’ll find it in the community. The second issue was more annoying and potentially problematic. In its stock configuration, the A1 Mini’s filament guide moves up and down with the Z-axis. During calibration routines or tall prints, this movement sometimes caused the filament to slip off the spool or become tangled – not exactly what you want to discover halfway through a long print. Thankfully, another community-designed solution came to the rescue: a top-mounted Bowden guide that attaches to the top of the Z-axis tower. This keeps the filament path consistent regardless of the print head’s height, completely eliminating the tangling issues. I’ve also printed several quality-of-life improvements, like covers for the printer’s various ports and cable management clips. While none of these upgrades were strictly necessary, they’ve helped keep my setup tidy and protected. It’s somewhat meta that one of the best uses for a 3D printer is printing improvements for itself, but that’s part of what makes this hobby so engaging, especially if you take the time to learn a CAD software tool and gain the ability to create your own 3D models.

The retro dual-sided design features a fun cook station, bench seating, and checkered tiles for an ultra-cool aesthetic. Bring the amusement park to the backyard (or living room if possible)! The Step2 Up & Down Roller Coaster Kids is a thrilled-filled ride for tiny tots. The high back set and easy grip keep them safe and balanced as they stroll down the multi-colored track. Pardon me, but we ought to believe that a Baby’s First Molly Manners Doll is one of the best toy buys on Black Friday. Why so? It sings out lessons about manners and good etiquette, so your kiddo will be saying “Yes, Ma’am!” in no time. For your future Moetzart, meet the Winfun Baby Music Center. Think of this like a free music class. It’s equipped with a light-up demo song, and drum solo sounds, plus an adjustable microphone, and stand included. You know what this means. They’ll be a member of the band in no time. We have nieces, and they have the Melissa & Doug Perfect Pasta Play Set. Not only is it adorable (just look at the diversity of pasta shapes!) but it’s perfect to pair with any play kitchen. Let’s face it. The seasons are turning, and some snow is inevitable. It’s not easy to keep the kids cooped up all day long. You may as well make a fabulous time out of it and send your kiddo down the hill in a super-safe, little sled that you’ll never lose sight of.

Title: Instead of AirPods, I'd recommend Meta Ray-Bans as the best tech deal of Black Friday 2024

'ZDNET Recommends': What exactly does it mean? ZDNET's recommendations are based on many hours of testing, research, and comparison shopping. We gather data from the best available sources, including vendor and retailer listings as well as other relevant and independent reviews sites. And we pore over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the products and services we’re assessing. When you click through from our site to a retailer and buy a product or service, we may earn affiliate commissions. This helps support our work, but does not affect what we cover or how, and it does not affect the price you pay. Neither ZDNET nor the author are compensated for these independent reviews. Indeed, we follow strict guidelines that ensure our editorial content is never influenced by advertisers. ZDNET's editorial team writes on behalf of you, our reader.

If we have made an error or published misleading information, we will correct or clarify the article. If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form. The Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses have been the surprise hit among the most popular tech products of 2024. For a Black Friday deal available through Saturday, Nov. 30, you can grab a pair for the equivalent of $149 through a special two-part deal. Amazon is offering the Meta Ray-Bans with the classic black frames for $239 (20% off the $299 retail price). And through Nov. 30, you also get a $90 digital credit that you can use for other holiday shopping on Amazon. Assuming you can use that Amazon credit toward other things you would have bought anyway, that means you can snag a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses for the equivalent of 50% off. The 20% deal may stick around, but the $90 credit is scheduled to end on Saturday, Nov. 30 -- so act quickly if you want to grab that one. Also: The best Black Friday deals still available This is an especially awesome deal when you consider the Meta Ray-Bans were often out of stock for much of the first half of 2024 and have rarely been discounted. They look just like normal Ray-Bans, and you can even replace the lenses with your glasses prescription. The caveat to keep in mind here is that Amazon sells eight different styles of the Meta Ray-Bans, and it's the classic black frames with green tinted lenses that are on sale for the lowest price. Other styles cost $30 to $80 more. For example, if you want to wear these smart glasses both inside and outside, then you can get a pair with transition lenses. Those normally retail for $379, but Amazon is offering them 20% off, for $303, and the $90 credit brings the equivalent cost down to $213 -- still a terrific deal. I tried the Meta Ray-Bans earlier this year and was much more impressed than I expected. First, to be clear, they are augmented reality glasses, but they're audio-only, so there's no screen overlaid on the lenses. All the feedback comes through the speakers that down-fire into your ears and are hidden in the arms of the glasses. Also: Why Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses are my favorite tech purchase this year I was also pleasantly surprised by the audio quality. For phone calls and conference calls and for listening to podcasts and audiobooks, the sound is nearly as bright and clear as a pair of AirPods or other quality earbuds. For listening to music, movies, or shows with lots of bass and surround sound effects, the Meta Ray-Bans are acceptable but not nearly as robust as a pair of high-end headphones from Apple, Sony, Bose, and others. And because of the open concept, naturally the Meta Ray-Bans can't offer the kind of noise cancellation that you get from AirPods Pro or the Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds, for example. All in all, the sound of the Meta Ray-Bans is similar to what you get from the AirPods Pro in transparency mode. But, the Meta Ray-Bans can also do things that no headphones can do. They have a built-in 12-megapixel ultrawide camera for taking photos and capturing videos. This camera is about the same quality as an iPhone 12 or a Samsung Galaxy S20. It only takes photos and videos in portrait mode, but it's far faster to tap the button on top of the right arm of the glasses than it is to pull your camera out of your pocket. The Meta Ray-Bans also have a built-in AI assistant that you can trigger by saying "Hey Meta," and use the large language models that Meta has been furiously building over the past several years. For basic information searches, it works well and is another nice option for leaving your phone in your pocket. The battery life is about a half-day with moderate use, but you can quickly charge to about 50% with 20 minutes in the included case. The case itself charges via standard USB-C, which is nice. You can nearly double the battery by turning off the "Hey Meta" listening feature -- which I did. Meta also regularly rolls out software updates that bring new functionality to the Meta Ray-Bans. For example, during 2024 the Meta Ray-Bans added the capability of translating from Spanish to English in real time and the ability to do a visual search to identify landmarks or translate street signs. And Meta says it will continue to add new features such as helping you remember things you've seen, like your parking spot. Also: The best Apple deals for Cyber Monday 2024 If you're concerned about the way Meta handles privacy -- as many of us are -- the good thing about the Meta Ray-Bans is that they don't require a Facebook account. While they do require a Meta account, you can at least ostensibly keep them separate from your Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp data. That makes it easier for me to recommend the product from a privacy perspective. Don't get me wrong, the AirPods Pro 2 are available for a great deal at $153 ($97 off) for Black Friday and Cyber Monday. But the Meta Ray-Bans can do nearly all that the AirPods Pro can do and more and you can get them for roughly of the same price -- if you count the Amazon credit. And since smart glasses are getting more and more common and the promise of smarter AI-powered features are on the horizon, getting a pair of Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses gives you a better chance of getting a taste of the future. Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we constantly find new chances to save and share them with you on ZDNET.com.

Title: We uncovered 57 online clothing shops trying to scam Australians. And they’re just the tip of the iceberg

Search the news, stories & people Personalise the news and stay in the know Emergency Backstory Newsletters 中文新闻 BERITA BAHASA INDONESIA TOK PISIN By Lucy Carter By Matt Martino By Michael Workman ABC NEWS Verify Topic:Retail Industry At first glance, Vogue Melbourne looks every inch an upmarket Australian boutique. The website features photos of models in fashionable clothes and slogans like "Be You Be Beautiful". It boasts 100,000 satisfied customers, an extensive catalogue of items and claims to accept a range of reputable payment options. Look a little closer though and things aren't quite what they seem. You might have noticed that the site is advertising a Halloween sale with up to 50 per cent discounts. Halloween came and went at the end of October, but that sale has continued. Since ABC NEWS Verify started monitoring this site in early October, there has always been an up to 50 per cent discount advertised. Back then, it was called a "winter sale". Let's look closer at one product: this dress. It looks like a professionally taken photograph of a stylish garment. The site even gives it a "trademarked" name "Annaliese". The photos appear to have come from London fashion brand House of CB. The garment is the Lolita Apricot Corset Sundress, for sale with House of CB for $322 (currently on sale for $261). We also found the same photographs advertising the dress on Chinese shopping website AliExpress for as little as $19.09. So either Vogue Melbourne is getting a sweet deal on a designer fashion item, or it is shipping a cheap knock off. As the name — and this sandwich board — suggest, Vogue Melbourne claims to have a physical presence in Victoria's capital. It even lists a physical address on the home page, placing it inside Melbourne's upmarket Emporium shopping centre. But this image has been generated from a custom stock image company. And it's unlikely that a Sydney store will be opening anytime soon when there's no record of the Melbourne store inside the Emporium mall. Then there are the reviews. The site appears to be displaying an authentic Trustpilot review system, a legitimate website which allows customers to provide public feedback about businesses. Vogue Melbourne claims its Trustpilot rating is excellent — but again, it's a fake. The actual rating according to the real Trustpilot site? Bad. But surely it's not all negative, right? At least Vogue Melbourne offers a 30-day, money-back guarantee? Well, the site's real Trustpilot page is full of stories of that promise not being kept by the store. Vogue Melbourne presents itself as a high-end, Australian fashion retailer. But as you can see, it is anything but. ABC NEWS Verify has discovered many more sites just like it, all convincing Australians to part with their money, sometimes for an inferior product and sometimes for no product at all … How social media is giving scammers the tools they need to trick Australians into parting with their money. Vogue Melbourne is one of more than 50 shopping websites ABC NEWS Verify has tracked over several months that appear to be falsely representing themselves online as high-end Australian retailers. Almost exclusively run from overseas, the websites are mass-produced digital stores sometimes selling cheap and often poor-quality products imported directly from Asia. They have a strong and seemingly unchecked presence on Meta's social media platforms Facebook and Instagram. Despite having names like Sydney Stylista, Beaumont Gold Coast and Perth Apparel, Facebook transparency information often shows these pages have several administrators outside of Australia. Nonetheless, social media giant Meta allows these pages to run ads on its platforms that target Australians and funnel them to their websites. Many of the ads use similar language, and sometimes the same images that tug at the heart strings of shoppers, with talk of closing down sales, and shop fires. While there's nothing illegal about shipping goods in from another country, customers are being tricked into thinking they are shopping locally. They're left with little practical recourse for international returns or exchanges, and often hundreds of dollars out of pocket. Meta didn't respond directly to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify by time of publication, but confirmed they are looking into the flagged pages. "We are investigating this matter. Meta doesn't want scams on our platforms, and we are continuing to invest in tools and technology to prevent them. The safety of our users is of utmost importance, and we continue to work with industry, the government and law enforcement to protect Australians from scams." The 57 online stores ABC NEWS Verify has tracked are managed and run by different people and groups but have a very similar look online. The websites appear to have been designed and created using common templates on the e-commerce platform Shopify. They then advertise heavily on social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. The products they sell are mostly mass-produced fast-fashion items, commonly produced in Asia. The sites all use a legal supply chain model called dropshipping. The product you receive has often been shipped from an entirely different country, without any direct handling from the seller. Normally, when you make a purchase on a website … … it's the retailer who ships the product directly to you. But with dropshipping, the retailer places an order with a supplier, who could be located in a completely different country. That supplier then ships the item directly to you, without the involvement of the retailer who you placed the order with. So what happens when you want to make a return or exchange? Some of these dropshipping websites offer them for "free". But you can't just return your item to the online store that you bought from. Buried in the returns policy fine print of many of the stores we investigated, was a clause which states returns are shipped back to a central warehouse in Asia. That's the original supplier. And while the buyer could possibly get their money back … … what they're often surprised to learn, often buried in the fine print, is that they have to foot the international shipping bill to send the item back to the supplier. This can sometimes be close to or equal the amount paid for the item in the first place. This is difficult for consumer regulators to police, as while dropshipping is a perfectly legal business model, where this scam begins is the misleading tactics being used to deceive shoppers into thinking they've been dealing with a local business. This can leave customers feeling misled, dissatisfied and out-of-pocket. Rosie Thomas, the director of campaigns at consumer watchdog Choice told ABC NEWS Verify that after thinking you've been dealing with an Australian business, the idea that you would have to pay to ship the item back overseas to return it often comes as "quite a shock". "Even if you return the item, if you don't get the refund, or you don't get the response that you would like, there are limited options in the digital environment as to where you can take your complaint." Catriona Lowe, the deputy chair of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission told ABC NEWS Verify that all customers shopping online in Australia — even with international operators — have rights. "All businesses that trade in Australia are required to comply with the Australian consumer law, and that includes not misleading consumers about where your business is based." "If consumers do feel that they've been misled by this conduct, we encourage them to get in contact either with our info centre or with their state and territory fair trading agencies." Retired music teacher Julie (not her real name) was excited when she spotted a colourful knitted jumper advertised for sale on Instagram by the now-defunct online store Aussie Hilda. At $84 the jumper wasn't an insignificant purchase for the aged pensioner, but she reasoned that its 'original price', at $250, was listed far higher and that she may have stumbled onto a bargain. "Very naively, my mind thought that it was a good quality item and it had been reduced. I thought it was coming from Australia. And I thought if there's any problem with it, I'll be able to just send it back to Australia, probably to Melbourne," she said. What arrived in the post several weeks later was far from the high-quality warm jumper she was expecting. Instead it was a low-quality polyester fabric with the pattern of a knit printed onto it. "I was just absolutely shocked to the socks about it, because it was just such a complete piece of garbage. "Thin plastic-y fabric has been used to make the jumper and then something is stamped onto it at the front and the back." The ACCC's Catriona Lowe says it appears Julie has the right to lodge a formal complaint. "It is incredibly important that the business is not misleading consumers about the nature of their business, about what they might expect in terms of delivery times and of course, that what they are purchasing, or what they can see online, matches what they ultimately are delivered." A second shock came when Julie tried to return the item and arrange a refund. "They said I'd have to send it back to some address in China somewhere, and that I would have to pay the postage to which I said to them, 'well, it's going to cost me almost the same amount in postage as it cost me for the actual item'," Julie said. Julie is one of more than 40 disgruntled customers of these websites that ABC NEWS Verify has spoken to as part of this investigation. She eventually managed to obtain a refund through PayPal after weeks of frustrating back and forth with Aussie Hilda administrators, who appear to be located in Indonesia. Extraordinarily, when the 73-year-old Sydneysider reported the page to Instagram's parent company Meta for its deceptive behaviour, she says her account was temporarily blocked, while Aussie Hilda's page remained active and advertising for many more weeks. "I would never buy anything through Instagram or Facebook again," she said. Choice's Ms Thomas says Meta needs to do much more. "We think, at a minimum, Meta should be verifying the identities of the businesses that it's taking money from to advertise on their platforms. "This would ensure that those businesses are who they say they are. And in the case of scams, should pick up whether or not it is an impersonation and and there's a significant risk for consumers." One of the most common deceptions we've seen the 57 tracked websites use is fake product reviews. In addition to the fake Trustpilot reviews highlighted earlier, many of these sites also display fake unbranded testimonials often using stock or AI generated images. The familiar names on these reviews below, for example, give away the game. The names do not even match the supplied photographs. These fake reviews often have wording that no human would ever actually use. Using dated Australian slang like "cobber" and describing delivery as "quick as a rat up a drainpipe", they appear to be crafted to seem authentic to Australians but are anything but. The lies and AI carry over to many of the ads we see plastered across Meta's social media platforms — with claims of shops closing down, burning down and using artificially generated store owners. We've also tracked shops stealing or altering photos of real Australian shopfronts. Legitimate Melbourne store Kloke had no idea a photo of its very real store was being used by Wilson Melbourne on its Facebook page, until contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. Fake Sydney outlet TrendyOz is actually a badly photoshopped photo of a Calvin Klein store in Sydney's CBD Westfield. Online store Vogue Melbourne claims to be run by Garry Williams, an Australian physiotherapist and Cècile Laurent, a "talented" French fashion designer. Vogue Melbourne presents these photographs of "Garry" and "Cècile" on its About Us page. As we mentioned, it claims Garry is Australian, and Cècile is French. But Vogue Melbourne is not the only shopping website these images appear on. They're also here on Marlo London, which targets British customers. But this time, Garry is English. At Modezentrum Krause, which looks identical but targets German customers, the language changes … Cècile and her profession remain. Garry, meanwhile, has been replaced by "Thomas Krause", who is now a German physiotherapist. ABC NEWS Verify has established the real identities of both of these people using open source intelligence techniques. Both had their images taken from their own websites or social media accounts, apparently without their knowledge. "Garry" is actually a Dutch man, who we were not able to contact. And "Cècile" is an American woman named Cora, who expressed astonishment that her image had been stolen and used on these websites when contacted by ABC NEWS Verify. "I had no idea they were using my photo or claiming it was them in the photo. There was definitely no consent given on my part," she said. "It is extremely confusing why they would take my photo and say that they are the ones in it. They are trying to deceive people and it's quite sickening. It's also just frustrating because that is a photo of me working and taken by a professional photographer which makes me feel violated." These three websites appear to be connected to each other through a single operator, as well as to a fourth website, Averley Boutique Toronto. The websites list the same Dutch business name and number in their terms and service pages and ABC NEWS Verify has also documented them using the same PayPal as a payment beneficiary. The beneficiary is listed as NYH E-Commerce. According to Dutch business records, the company has a sole shareholder and employee named Nadir El Haddouti. The postal address for the business is this self-storage unit in the Dutch city of Rotterdam. It isn't clear where Mr El Haddouti lives, but he has ties to both the Netherlands and the United Arab Emirates through his Dutch-registered business. His business number is also listed on the website of a luxury car rental company based in Dubai as well as a consultancy business geared towards minimising value-added tax for dropshippers, based in the Netherlands. Dutch business records show the operations related to his business number include the "renting of passenger cars and light motor vehicles" and "retail sale via internet of apparel and clothing accessories". Social media accounts belonging to the luxury car rental business, Carplug Dubai, suggest the operator mixes with others living opulent lifestyles. For instance, one video, which shows a young man revving a performance car valued at over $100,000, is captioned in Dutch "Samen met de jongste CEO van NL". This translates to "Together with the youngest CEO of NL [the Netherlands]". ABC NEWS Verify attempted to contact Mr El Haddouti through various channels, but received no response. Opaque ownership is common to the 57 pages tracked by ABC NEWS Verify. We detected ties to individuals based overseas in all the sites we tracked. Links to the Netherlands were frequently found among this cohort. Operating a business outside of Australia that dropships goods into the country is something that is perfectly legal and thus, outside the scope of regulators. Where it becomes a problem is when consumers think they are dealing with a local business, and all the imputations of quality and ease of dealings that come with that assumption. There's a whole industry built around creating websites just like these on gig economy websites like Fiverr. ABC NEWS Verify has seen a range of different prices and delivery times for fully operational shopping websites offered on that platform. The cheapest and quickest we came across was a 10-product website with a three-day delivery time for just under $50. We saw prices on other accounts for as much as $1,000 for a 50-product store delivered in a week. Some of these sellers go on to offer to manage the marketing and operation of the page for several hundred of dollars a month. ABC NEWS Verify also came across multiple websites that were almost identical in layout. We know the websites were being operated by different people because the PayPal beneficiaries were different, and their Facebook pages listed administrators in different countries. These four seemingly unrelated pages all appear to be modelled from a website called Sol and Sparrow Melbourne. Whoever built the three copies hasn't even bothered to delete Sol and Sparrow's name from the body copy on some of their product pages and some use the very same images. Shopify didn't respond to detailed questions from ABC NEWS Verify but a spokesperson confirmed it was investigating the online shops flagged. "Shopify's Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) clearly outlines what is not permitted on our platform. We're reviewing these stores and will take action on any found to violate our policies." There are now a range of companies online that allow these websites to be created with ease and at scale, meaning purveyors can dropship to anywhere in the world with little effort. It's clear these Australian-targeted websites we have uncovered are just the tip of an international iceberg. Remember that dress from before? A simple reverse image search shows a raft of similar internationally-focused websites on which it appears. This grift is truly global. As shoppers wade through Black Friday sales and then into Christmas shopping, many might be asking how they can keep themselves safe when seeking to buy high quality and good value products online. ABC NEWS Verify asked our experts from Choice and the ACCC for their top tips when it comes to shopping online and avoiding scams. Ms Thomas from Choice says slowing down is key. "Scam ads or fraudulent retailer ads very likely will create a sense of urgency to try and make you act quickly. "Take a moment to check the website, check the URL, see if there are any red flags that suggest that maybe this business is not what you think it is." (It's worth mentioning that none of the URLs we encountered in our investigation carried a .au Australian domain, though its presence in a URL doesn't necessarily mean the site you're looking at is not a scam.) Catriona Lowe from the ACCC agrees that doing a bit of homework can save heartache later on. Being skeptical of reviews posted directly on the website is a good start. "Be wary of websites that you're not familiar with, including if you might have received adverts about them on social media," she said. A really good thing to do is to check online forums and review sites, because often you might, you might find that other consumers will be talking. "And then the last tip that we give to people is, if you are feeling a little cautious you may wish to shop with a credit or debit card. What that means is, if something does go wrong, you may have the right to do what's called a chargeback, and that means actually reversing that transaction with your financial institution, rather than the particular business that you might have given those details to." ABC NEWS Verify spent months documenting and investigating overseas dropshipping operations that falsely claimed to have a physical presence in Australia. The operations were identified by reviewing advertisements targeting Australians on Meta's platforms like Facebook along with keyword searches of Meta's ad library. Our investigation focused on stores that had an implied and or explicit physical presence in Australia — ranging from stores using Australian locations in their names to dropshipping stores creating digital images of fake physical shop fronts in Australian locations. ABC NEWS Verify then investigated who was behind them, unearthing links across the globe including ties to countries such as the Netherlands, UAE, China and the United States. Our investigation also helped unveil some of the common tactics and practices these kinds of operations deploy. Although ABC NEWS Verify uncovered the identity of several overseas individuals and businesses linked to some stores, most remain opaque, due in part to measures by the operators to mask their ownership and because of the transparency limitations of the Australian version of Meta's ad library. Although Meta has greater transparency on digital ads than some other digital platforms, the company's ad transparency in Australia is limited compared to some jurisdictions like the EU. Meta in the EU is subject to the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA) which, once introduced, compelled Meta to display and archive all ads that targeted people in the EU, and store them for a year. Detecting scammers and others abusing Meta's platforms in Australia remains a "whack-a-mole" exercise — one exacerbated by Meta's closure of the transparency tool CrowdTangle earlier this year.

Title: I've been looking for an LG OLED C4 deal all year, and Black Friday has finally delivered

The 55-inch LG OLED C4 is finally at the price I've been hoping for When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. I have been hoping, saving, and waiting for a Black Friday OLED TV deal this year. I got a 4K TV in August of 2020, and although it's served me very well, it's starting to get backlight bleed - an annoying degradation of the display where its backlight rings shine through the panel and become easy to spot. As someone who reviews all sorts of technology for a living, I know that OLED TVs are the ones worth spending money on these days, but they're not the easiest to afford. This year I've been scraping money together where I can, and I've been watching the price of LG's 55-inch OLED C4 like a hawk because I know that it's the perfect TV for me, but this brand's screens only enter my price range once or twice a year. I've been waiting for it to drop as close to the $1,000 mark as possible - mainly because I still want to be able to pay my rent. Black Friday has finally delivered the goods, because it's now down to $1,196.99 at Amazon, giving it a $300 discount. Besides a blip on the price history data that sort of looks like someone pressed the wrong button somewhere, this is the cheapest this screen has ever fallen to. A brief Black Friday OLED TV deal brought it down to $1,096 about two weeks ago before it was immediately hoisted back upward. The 55-inch models of LG's OLEDs can be tough to find deals for because they're one of the most popular sizes in the range, and stock can disappear in a heartbeat. LG OLED C4 55-inch TV | $1,499.99 $1,196.99 at AmazonSave $300 - This is likely as close to the $1,000 mark you'll find this display drop to before it starts being replaced by the inevitable C5. Sometimes you see this model get discounts in February as LG tries to get rid of stock, but it can be really tough to find good deals on these TVs from this point on. Buy it if: ✅ You want one of the best pound-for-pound gaming TVs on the market✅ You want a screen with a high refresh rate✅ You've been waiting for a good deal Don't buy it if: ❌ You can make do with a slower refresh rate❌ You need to keep saving for now Price check: $1,296 at Walmart | $1,199.99 at Best Buy UK: £1,199 at Currys So why is it the LG OLED C4 that I'm so desperate to go for? Other brands do make OLED displays these days, and some of them can be a bit cheaper than LG. Well, for starters, I know that LG is the company that makes the OLED technology for a lot of smaller TV brands, so you know you're getting the purest form of panel straight from the source if you buy from them. Next, it's the 55-inch size I'm looking for because that suits my home the most. A 65-inch 4K display might actually look like better quality due to viewing distances and pixel densities, but I think that size of screen would be a bit intense for the room I'd put it in. I think 55-inch is the best value spot for a living room screen size worth investing in, without overspending on the sizes TV manufacturers tell you you need. Then there are specs, which might help you to decide which of the best gaming TVs is the best for you. I watch a lot of movies and TV shows, and my time for viewing them is sacred. I want to make it as close to a cinema atmosphere as possible, and an OLED panel combined with Dolby Vision support will really bring that feeling home. Next, I want to use it for PC gaming, so I'd like a high refresh rate. The C4 sports a stunning 144Hz refresh rate that my Maingear Zero Ruby will absolutely be able to make use of. I wouldn't wait around if any of this sounds relatable to you. LG OLEDs are popular choices, and I'd expect the 55-inch model to fly off the shelves this Black Friday. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more There are other offers to make the most of if this is out of your price range. Black Friday Meta Quest deals, Black Friday Xbox deals, and Black Friday CPU deals might get you a bigger saving that's more achievable for you. One of my earliest memories is playing SuperMario64 and wondering why the controller I held had three grips, but I only had two hands. Ever since I've been in love with video games and their technology. After graduating from Edinburgh Napier University with a degree in Journalism, I contributed to the Scottish Games Network and completed an Editorial Internship at Expert Reviews. Over the last decade, I’ve been managing my own YouTube channel about my love of games too. These days, I'm one of the resident hardware nerds at GamesRadar+, and I take the lead on our coverage of gaming PCs, VR, controllers, gaming chairs, and content creation gear. Now, I better stop myself here before I get talking about my favourite games like HUNT: Showdown, Dishonored, and Towerfall Ascension. Location: UK Remote If younger me could see how much this 4K 144Hz gaming TV is this Black Friday, they'd tell me I'm full of it I'd recommend the Samsung Odyssey OLED G6 all day for 1440p gaming, and Black Friday just made it more affordable The battle to be the highest-rated game of the year continues as Astro Bot finally claims the top spot from Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree GamesRadar+ is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

We already touched down this morning with our master roundup of the best Thanksgiving price drops, but there’s even more to come and some particular highlights we wanted to showcase. We have now have a new all-time low Microsoft’s Surface Laptop 7 with 12-core Snapdragon X Elite chip at over $400 off alongside a giant selection of other Snapdragon and Chromebook deals. Those offers join Google’s Black Friday price drop on Pixel 9 Pro XL that is now $100 less than advertised, a rare deal on Meta Quest 3 for Black Friday, the very first discount on the new supersized Echo Show 21 smart display, and the best price ever on the 2024 Samsung S24 FE from $450 shipped. But all that’s all just for starters, head below for a closer look at today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is now offering Microsoft’s 2024 Surface Laptop 7 Copilot+ PC at $999 shipped. That’s $401 less than its usual going rate of $1,400 and the lowest we have tracked for it so far. Today’s 29% offer drops this touchscreen Copilot+ PC with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD $100 below its previous all-time low, and it’s now only $100 more than its relatively less powerful sibling with the Snapdragon X Plus chip. The new Surface Laptop 7 is available in Platinum, Black, Dune, and Sapphire colorways, and they’re all down to the $999 low today. The same model, in case you’re wondering, is currently fetching $1,100 at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While the official Google Black Friday sale got off to an early start this year only to see Amazon and Best Buy get aggressive with even deeper deals, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has now dropped again. Google advertised and subsequently launched a $150 price drop on this model and now Amazon has it starting down at $849 shipped – Best Buy has since priced matched on this model as well. Regularly $1,099, this is a straight $250 price drop to deliver a new Amazon all-time low and the lowest we have tracked to date on Google’s latest XL-sized handset. Best Buy is currently offering a $75 gift card with Meta’s 512GB Quest 3 VR headset at $499.99 shipped as a part of its Black Friday Doorbuster deals. This particular headset dropped to the $499 mark after the Quest 3S debut in September. Today’s Black Friday deal essentially lands a $75 discount on it with a FREE gift card that can go towards your other purchases at Best Buy. Head below for more details. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. Update 11/28: Amazon has now price matched the Best Buy Doorbuster offer starting $449.99 shipped. Update 11/28: Best Buy’s next Doorbuster sale is now offering the new Samsung S24 FE from $449.99 shipped to deliver the lowest price we have tracked to date at $200 off the going rate – this deal is currently undercutting both Samsung and Amazon. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

WIRED's Black Friday 2024 Coverage Samsung's S90D (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the best TVs you can buy right now, offering vivid yet naturalistic colors, class-leading brightness, and the near-infinite contrast and perfect black levels that make OLED TVs so gobsmacking to gaze at. Outside its stellar performance, you’ll get a loaded suite of gaming features, including four HDMI 2.1 inputs for advanced gameplay, a dedicated game bar, and Samsung's Game Hub to stream from services like Xbox Game Pass. The one notable drawback for all Samsung TVs is their lack of Dolby Vision HDR, which is more prevalent than Samsung’s dynamic alternative, HDR10+. Even so, I’d happily have this stylish beauty as my primary display, offering picture quality that’s among the best I’ve seen all year at its best price yet. —Ryan Waniata This Panasonic 4K Blu-Ray player supports both Dolby Vision and HDR10+, which makes it fully optimized for getting the most out of your discs. I like how simple and easy to use these players are, although they do have software that feels a bit like it was coded 20 years ago. Discs look way better than streaming content in most cases, so a solid deal on this player is a must if you’re looking to see your favorite content in the best possible quality. —Parker Hall Sony’s Bravia 9 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-performing backlit TV around. It blends next-gen brightness with Sony’s proprietary dimming and picture processing to provide stunningly balanced performance across the board. The TV’s brightness pushes toward the psychedelic when called upon, but with measured dispersal to keep from blowing your eyeballs out. On the other end, you’ll experience OLED-like black levels and contrast, and 4K detail that pops off the screen. Sony only offers two HDMI 2.1 ports, meaning you’re losing two slots for gaming consoles over competitors, and the TV’s off-axis viewing is good, not great. That’s the price you’ll pay for brilliance that outdoes even the most fiery OLED displays. If you’ve been looking for a good sale on the best LED TV out there, your search is over. —Ryan Waniata The price of Sony’s impressive Bravia 7 TV (7/10, WIRED Recommends) has sunk like a stone. I took points off the score for its poor off-axis performance, but if you’re watching mostly from straight on, this TV rocks. You’ll get stunning clarity and detail, excellent brightness, vibrant quantum dot colors, and deep black levels thanks to the same algorithm that helps Sony’s Bravia 9 TV look so good. Like all of Sony’s premium TVs, the Bravia 7 offers only two HDMI 2.1 ports, limiting your options for high-performance gaming when compared to some of the best TVs in its class. Otherwise, this is a sweet screen for hundreds less than its inflated launch price. —Ryan Waniata Hisense's 65-inch U7N QLED TV (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our choice as the best TV for most people right now, thanks to its impressive performance and features for the money. The TV’s swarm of mini LED backlights serve up fiery brightness and deep black levels with minimal light bleed, meaning the picture looks great in the daylight and the dark. It’s got great gaming features, including VRR (variable refresh rate) for gaming at up to 144 kHz from its high-refresh panel, and an intuitive Google TV smart system to run the show. Videophiles will likely notice some dirty screen effect—this is a value model after all—and like nearly all backlit TVs, its off-axis viewing is just OK. Still, there’s little to complain about in this well-balanced package, serving up big 4K thrills at a crazy-low price. —Ryan Waniata If you’re after a solid screen at a sweet price, Roku’s baseline Plus Series could be right up your alley. It all starts with the fantastic Roku operating system that makes it remarkably simple to call up connected devices, grab any app, and even track down your remote with a built-in chime. Frankly, that last feature is so fundamental I can’t believe it isn’t standard in all modern TVs. The Plus Series’ panel only offers a 60-Hz refresh rate, so it’s not the best option for serious gamers, but it’s a solid performer thanks to good brightness and punchy colors. Thanks to local dimming, you won’t see blotchy patches when the lights are down, either. Support for Apple Homekit, Alexa, and Google Assistant rounds out the package for a great budget buy. —Ryan Waniata For those looking to see the blaze of summer in the dead of winter, Hisense’s 65-inch U8N TV serves up stunning brightness that nearly doubles many TVs in its price class. All that power doesn’t come at the cost of contrast, as the TV provides excellent black levels with minimal light bleed, alongside vivid quantum dot colors to let you bask in its sizzling punch in any lighting. You’ll also get the latest gaming features, a breezy Google TV interface, and every major flavor of HDR. The off-axis viewing isn’t anything to write home about, but this TV feels more premium than it has a right to for under $1,000. Looking to go bigger? The 75-inch version is still reasonable at $1,300, or you can go nuclear with the 85-incher for $300 more. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Apple’s latest iPad Mini (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with several internal upgrades. With an A17 Pro chip, it can handle both graphically demanding games and Apple Intelligence (the company’s suite of artificial intelligence features) with ease. It also has support for the feature-packed Apple Pencil Pro. All of this is packed into a tiny build that’s great for traveling with—whether you’re using it for gaming or reading ebooks. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. It’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite iPad (7/10, WIRED Review) to recommend to most people. It’s powered by the A14 Bionic chip, which is the same one you’ll find in the iPhone 12, that never felt sluggish in our testing. It has a modernized design too, with slim bezels around a larger 10.9-inch Liquid Retina (IPS LCD) display, along with a USB-C port for charging, Touch ID in the power button, and a 12-megapixel selfie camera that’s been moved to the center of the iPad. It comes with support for the first-gen stylus or the USB-C Apple Pencil as well as the Magic Keyboard Folio and the original Smart Folio case. —Brenda Stolyar Apple’s latest iPad Pro tablet (6/10, WIRED Review) has several new features. It packs a bigger and brighter display, an upgraded OLED screen, and the front-facing camera has landscape mode. Under the hood is the latest M4 chip, which delivers snappy performance. It’s also compatible with a variety of new accessories including Magic Keyboard, Apple Pencil Pro, and Smart Folio case. However, we still recommend the 2022 M2-powered iPad Pro. So, it’s a great alternative if you want to save even more cash. —Brenda Stolyar This excellent 3-in-1 charger for your iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch is one of the best MagSafe chargers around. You can fold it away to a very compact size, making it an ideal travel companion. Charging for your iPhone goes up to 15 watts via a magnetic pad that can adjust to your preferred angle. There’s another pad for AirPods or other wireless earbuds, and a fold-out Apple Watch charger on the back. A 5-foot USB-C cable and wall adapter are included. —Simon Hill This is a great accessory if you want to use your iPhone as a webcam. Thanks to a feature called Continuity Camera, you can use your iPhone as a webcam for a MacBook (you can check out these instructions for how to set it up). The circular silicone puck magnetically connects to your iPhone (it also doubles as a kickstand or phone grip), and there’s a section that pops out so you can mount the iPhone on top of a MacBook. Since it utilizes the rear camera, the Belkin allows for a more natural video-calling experience and better image quality than the standard MacBook webcam. —Brenda Stolyar The first-generation Apple Pencil has been around for years now, but it’s still a solid option. It packs features like pressure sensitivity (the lines get thicker as you press harder on the display), tilt sensitivity (for shading), and handwriting support within apps and search fields. As for supported iPads, it works with the base model iPad (6th Gen and later), iPad Mini (5th Gen), the iPad Air (3rd Gen), iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st and 2nd Gen), and iPad Pro 10.5-inch. It reaches this price often, but it’s still a good deal. —Brenda Stolyar The second-gen Apple Pencil packs a variety of features including pressure sensitivity, handwriting support, tilt sensitivity, and double-tap (which lets you switch quickly between tools by tapping the stylus twice). It has support for wireless pairing and wireless charging too, so you can magnetically connect it to the top edge of the iPad and it’ll automatically start charging. As for supported iPads, it works with the iPad Mini (6th gen), iPad Air (4th gen and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (1st gen and later), and the 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later). It's not compatible with the iPad Air (M2) or iPad Pro (M4) though. —Brenda Stolyar This is the latest Apple Pencil to join the lineup. Unlike the 1st and 2nd-gen versions, it comes with a “squeeze” capability that triggers the tool palette (you can use double-tap as well) and a haptic engine that delivers feedback when you squeeze the stylus. The built-in gyroscope sensor also allows you to change the orientation of each tool as you twist it, giving you finer control. It’s only compatible with the iPad Air (M2), iPad Pro (M4), and iPad Mini (A17 Pro). —Brenda Stolyar The iMac with M4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a few notable upgrades, including a 12-megapixel webcam with support for Center Stage, the option to add a nano-texture display, and the accessories now come with USB-C ports. Powered by the latest M4 chip, it delivers great performance too. It’s currently our favorite desktop in our guide to Best All-in-One Computers. —Brenda Stolyar The Studio Display (9/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a large 27-inch screen that’s great for getting work done. I’ve been using it alongside the M4-powered MacBook Pro daily. It doesn’t have HDR, which means colors look a bit more saturated and contrasty to the neutral tones you’ll find on Apple’s Pro Display XDR. But the 5K resolution is stunning and sharp. Yes, it’s expensive, but it’s a great monitor that comes complete with a 12-megapixel camera, along with built-in mics and speakers. —Brenda Stolyar Having a proper ergonomic mouse can make a huge difference in your daily life, which is why we recommend the Logitech Lift for Mac, a vertically oriented mouse for Apple devices of all shapes and sizes. The vertical orientation puts your hand in a different position that some people may find more comfortable than a typical mouse, especially if you use your system for long periods at a time. It doesn’t cut where it counts though, with long battery life, a quiet magnetic scroll wheel, and a wide range of DPI settings to adjust to your liking. —Brad Bourque This MacBook Air (9/10, WIRED Recommends) with M1 is the cheapest MacBook you can buy. Although the M1 came out back in 2020, it’s still a speedy and capable chip for simple tasks and basic activities (like web browsing, sending emails, and word processing) along with light video editing. It also has solid battery life and will easily last you an entire day. It’s a good option if you’re looking for a reliable MacBook without breaking the bank. —Brenda Stolyar This is the next step up from the MacBook Air with M3. It has three USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4 (up from two on its predecessor) along with an SD card slot, HDMI port, high-impedance headphone jack, and MagSafe charging port. Apple also increased the memory on the base model from 8 gigabytes to 16 gigabytes. For an extra cost, you can add a nano-texture display too. You can also configure it with an M4 Pro or M4 Max for more power—both of which are also on sale. —Brenda Stolyar Apple recently launched the M4-powered versions of the MacBook Pro, but the 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains a great option. It has a bright display with mini-LED and a 1080p webcam built in. You’ll also get a 120-Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling. As usual, it packs plenty of ports, including two USB-C ports with Thunderbolt 4, an HDMI, a MagSafe charging port, an SD card slot, and a high-impedance headphone jack. We recommend it if you don’t want to spend over $2,000 on a MacBook Pro. —Brenda Stolyar The M3-powered MacBook Air (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Macbook for most people. It has a nice 13.6-inch LCD screen and 1080p webcam while the M3 delivers a solid boost in performance compared to the M1 chip. It’s mainly great for everyday tasks but is certainly capable of handling a bit more like basic video editing or photo editing. Thanks to the M3, you can also use it with two external displays—the older chips only support a single display. —Brenda Stolyar Even though I have the M4-powered MacBook Pro at my disposal, I still reach for the 15-inch MacBook Air (8/10, WIRED Recommends) to use as my daily driver. It’s an excellent choice if you want a bigger screen without all the Pro features. It has the same modern build as the smaller model too, as well as a 1080p webcam and M3 chip. It works great for all my tasks, including word processing, video calls, sending emails, web browsing, and streaming content. For smoother performance, I suggest going for the 16 GB of unified memory. —Brenda Stolyar The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best option for ultimate power (7/10, WIRED Review). As with its predecessor, you’ll get a Mini-LED screen with a 120-Hz refresh rate, 1080p webcam, and a six-speaker sound system. This time around, Apple upgraded the USB ports with support for Thunderbolt 5 (120 Gbps/sec), giving you faster data transfer speeds. We tested the M4 Pro, which is a bit faster than last year’s M3 max chip, but it’s still capable of handling anything you throw at it. For even more power, you can pair it with the M4 Max. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite keyboard case for iPads. The first half protects the back of the iPad and also comes with a kickstand while the second half has a detachable keyboard and trackpad. The case is not only durable and sturdy but also feels great to type on. Instead of Bluetooth, it connects using Apple’s Smart Connector so you don’t have to worry about draining battery life. It’s available for the base iPad (7th, 8th, and 9th Gen) along with the iPad Air (5th Gen and M2) and 11-inch iPad Pro (1st Gen and newer), 12.9-inch iPad Pro (5th and 6th Gen), as well as the 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with M4. —Brenda Stolyar This is one of our top picks in our guide to Best MacBook Accessories. The low-profile keys are satisfying to type on, while the slim and lightweight build is easy to travel with for those who like to take their peripherals on the go. It mimics the MacBook keyboard too, complete with a Do Not Disturb key and the option to program the function row key with Apple’s own apps like Keynote, Final Cut Pro, Safari, and more. It’s only available with tactile quiet switches, though. —Brenda Stolyar Logitech's Casa Pop-Up Desk (9/10, WIRED Review) is a great solution for those who constantly work on the go but prefer using an external keyboard and mouse with your laptop. Instead of carrying all those accessories around, the Casa Pop-Up Desk includes a keyboard and trackpad that fit neatly into a compact case that doubles as a laptop stand. It’s expensive, but it’s worth it if you’re always working out of the house. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Magna-Tiles may be expensive (a little less expensive now), but the return on investment is just staggering. We bought our daughter’s first set when she was 2 or 3 and enjoyed making little 2D ice cream cones or hats. Now she’s 9 and can make full villages for stuffed animals in the course of an afternoon. There are also a ton of different themed sets (also on sale) if you need more specialized pieces for race courses or jungles. —Adrienne So A firm WIRED favorite and one of the best family board games, Ticket to Ride features steam engine styling and rules that are easy to grasp. All you must do is claim railway routes across the US and Canada using your colorful plastic rail cars. Spend cards to claim routes, rack up bonus points for connecting specific destinations, and the person with the highest score at the end wins. All aboard, choo, choo! —Simon Hill Many of the best family board games are competitive and can sour into arguments all too easily, but Pandemic is a cooperative board game. Every player gets a role with unique special abilities, and you must all work together to wipe out four deadly diseases before they end humanity. Clear communication and coherent strategy are required, and you must leverage each player’s special abilities to win. Games can be completed within an hour, and there are many expansions for folks who enjoy the base game. —Simon Hill This Bluetooth-connected portable board finally got my 7- and 9-year-old interested in chess. The pieces feel wonderfully matte and heavy to play with. It connects to the GoChess app on your phone, which is integrated with Lichess and Chess.com. You can play against other people or get AI-enabled suggestions in person, and the board lights up to guide you. My kids will pick up pieces and discuss moves for hours. It's great.—Adrienne So Any building toy is great for encouraging creativity and hand-eye coordination, and WIRED reviewer Simon Hill’s whole family found the Clixo sets to be irresistible. The pieces are durable, flexible, washable, and colorful, and you don’t need a flat surface to build so you can play with them anywhere. They also come in themed sets that have glow-in-the-dark pieces. —Adrienne So If your kid is learning how to ride a bike, a Guardian bike is not that much more expensive than a big box store bike, and it weighs around 10 pounds less. Guardian's proprietary SureStop brake system which means the rear wheel will always brake before the front wheel, so your kid will never flip over. It works. I gave my kid's bike to a 20-year-old ding-dong to test in an empty parking garage, and he couldn't flip it.—Adrienne So Inspired by the Royal Palace of Evora in Portugal, with its Moorish blue-and-white ceramic tiles, this board game challenges you to make mosaics by matching tiles with different patterns and colors to amass the maximum possible score. One of the best family board games for all tastes, Azul is easy to grasp but supports many tactical approaches and has surprising depth. The beautiful tiles and other components are high quality, and filling your board is deeply satisfying. Play moves quickly, and you can complete a game in less than an hour, but you will probably want to play again immediately. —Simon Hill Start with a randomly generated map of hexagonal tiles in this addictive family board game, and gather and trade resources to develop your civilization and win. Amassing enough victory points requires a smart strategy and some dice-rolling luck. Catan is easy to get the hang of and only takes around an hour to finish. Players can trade freely, but the robber mechanic can cause arguments, so set some ground rules. The modular randomization makes for excellent replay value, and there are expansions and spin-offs to further complicate the gameplay. This game is for three or four players aged 10 years and up. —Simon Hill This cat-themed card game is easy to pick up and perfect for a quick game. The aim is to avoid exploding kitten cards by wielding a comical cast of cats with special powers. Timing and strategy are essential to get the best of your opponents. This fun card game appears in our best family board games guide. If it’s a hit with your fam, there are countless expansion packs worth trying. —Simon Hill One of the best family board games for larger groups, Herd Mentality is all about writing down the same answer as everyone else. If you agree with the majority of players on the best pizza topping, Disney movie, or the smallest animal that could carry your weight, you win a cow token. Eight tokens win you the game, but if you are the odd one out, you get the pink cow of doom. It’s funny and easy to play with any group. —Simon Hill Tacto is an app with physical pieces that convert your iPad, Android, or Fire tablet into a game board. With Tacto Chess, your kids can learn the basics, from how the pieces move to strategies for victory. The animated app features friendly voice acting and stories, chess puzzles to solve, a move predictor, and your child can play against AI or another person. My kids had some fun with this when they were learning, and it helped them understand chess a little better. This appears in our Best STEM Toys for Kids guide. —Simon Hill These markers are currently en route to my house to test for an upcoming gift guide update. They’ve gone exceedingly viral on TikTok and I can’t wait to get my hands on them. But generally, across the internet, they’ve got positive reviews. Each marker has a brush tip and a fineliner tip. You’ll get 120 colors, a swatch card, and a carrying case. Consider pairing them with a cozy coloring book (also en route to my house!) for hours of fun this winter. —Louryn Strampe I’m going to be honest with you: I hate these blinky, twinkly, one-trick-pony toys because my kids play with them for a week or two and then put them away forever. (Give them sets or skills they can build on, like games, Lego, or instruments.) Nevertheless, I make an exception because Sphero’s toys are so delightful and this price is ridiculous. My colleague Simon Hill’s wife uses this coding ball as a classroom aid to teach basic coding skills to 9-year-olds and older. It’s adorable and can move and navigate mazes through infrared communication. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals My quest to find the best portable chargers has led me to test hundreds of power banks, but this is my current favorite. I love the look of this transparent, prism-shaped device, but it’s also extremely useful with a maximum output of 170 watts and a 24,000-mAh capacity, not to mention tough, with an IP66 rating for water resistance. It will fast charge just about any small gadget, from phones to laptops, and the handy wee display shows battery life as a percentage, time remaining, and the input or output in watts. I have once seen it slightly cheaper, but this is a good price. —Simon Hill This is one of the best portable power stations for camping or road trips because it’s a manageable size. EcoFlow’s River 2 Pro has a LiFeP04 battery inside, which is good for 768 watt-hours. It has all the ports you need to charge your phones and other small gadgets, and the X-Boost surge enables it to power small appliances. You can charge it from an outlet or solar panels, though it takes more than an hour, and the fan can get a little noisy. —Simon Hill The Anker 737 is the upgrade pick in our best portable chargers guide. With a whopping 24,000 mAh capacity, support for power delivery 3.1, and the ability to send or receive up to 140 watts, this is the only power bank you need. It weighs nearly 1.4 pounds but is fairly compact, considering how much power it holds. A smart digital display shows battery percentage, and you can tap the power button to cycle through stats, including the temperature, total output, and more. This versatile portable charger fast-charged everything I tested and can easily juice up three devices at once. —Simon Hill Anker’s 657 charging station is an excellent charging station for those who charge a lot of devices simultaneously but also want to keep their floor and drawers tidy. It packs six electrical outlet plugs (three on each side) and two USB-C ports (one USB-C and one USB-A) that you can plug more cables into. But that’s not all. It also comes with two USB-C cables that support fast charging, which is great for your phone or laptop. It’s a great accessory to keep at the office, at home, or anywhere you use multiple gadgets at once. —Brenda Stolyar If you have multiple Apple gadgets, this T-shaped wireless charger makes it easy to charge them simultaneously. It suspends your iPhone (at 15-watt charging speed) and Apple Watch midair, while the rounded base charges your AirPods Pro or AirPods (with a wireless charging case). This version comes with Qi2 certification, which is the latest standard that enables faster, more efficient magnetic wireless charging. —Brenda Stolyar This is the best cheap 3-in-1 wireless charger. It has a compact design with an iPhone pad that is secure and charges at 15 watts. It also comes equipped with both a charging brick and cable. The Apple Watch charger slots into the back as a separate unit, which means you can take it with you (as long as there’s a USB-A port to plug it into). You can also use it for StandBy mode or to watch videos in landscape orientation. —Brenda Stolyar As a fan of the translucent electronics craze in the 1990s, I was immediately drawn to this power bank. You can see the ports, chips, and rechargeable Samsung Li-ion batteries inside. While an even better Shargeek (now Sharge) device replaced this in our best portable chargers guide, this power bank is still great. A color display shows the voltage, current, and power flowing in or out, and you can dig deeper for more stats. The DC barrel port lets you specify voltage and current for different devices, up to 75 watts, the first USB-C supports PD PPS up to 100 watts, the second offers 30 watts and supports PD 3.0 and Quick Charge 4 standards, and the USB-A port is QC 3.0 at up to 18 watts. —Simon Hill If you use Samsung devices, this is a great triple wireless charger for your Galaxy phone, Galaxy smartwatch, and Galaxy earbuds. Since it’s Qi-compatible, you can also use it to charge other devices as well—including iPhones. It also has LEDs that light up quickly when you place your gadgets down on it, and it also comes with a 25-watt wall charger and USB-C cable. However, it doesn’t work with all Galaxy watches. We found that it was, however, compatible with the Watch4 and older Watch3. —Brenda Stolyar We like Ugreen's 145-watt charger for its very fast charge times. It's compact for the power it provides, though it's not light at 1.1 pounds. You get two USB-C ports and one USB-A port. What sets the Ugreen apart is that you can actually draw all 145 watts while charging. That works out to one USB-C port at 100 W and the other at 45 W. —Scott Gilbertson This is our favorite MagSafe dash mount for the iPhone 12 or later. You can attach it via dashboard pad or windshield with a suction cup—both of which proved secure in our testing. There’s also a telescopic arm that combines with a ball joint for a wide range of movement, allowing you to find the ideal position. The USB-C charging cable is removable too, so you can store it when it’s not in use. There’s also a built-in fan to help keep you cool when it gets hot outside. Our only gripe is that it tops out at 7.5 watts for charging. —Brenda Stolyar The first portable power station from DJI can put out 2,200 watts steadily (2,600 watts surge), has two USB-C PD 3.1 ports (140 watts), and has DJI’s proprietary SDC ports for fast-charging drone batteries. It can charge phones, power microwaves or small tools, and meet most of your portable power needs, but it’s an especially great choice for folks with DJI drones because it can fast charge most models. It gets a little noisy with a lot of gadgets charging, and cable and bag accessories cost extra, but it still claims a place in our Best Portable Power Stations guide. —Simon Hill The Qi2 wireless charging standard was developed in partnership with Apple and features MagSafe-like magnetic alignment and speedier iPhone charging rates of up to 15 watts. This power bank can also charge other Qi2 devices (when they appear) and existing Qi devices (just more slowly). This compact power bank also has a handy kickstand, a two-way USB-C port, and an LED display that shows power and time to charge. You can attach MagSafe iPhones in portrait or landscape orientation, and it works with Apple’s StandBy mode, making it one of the Best MagSafe Power Banks. —Simon Hill Durable and versatile, this power bank slips easily into a bag and has a nice grippy, textured finish. The yellow is easy to spot in a crowded tent, and the segmented LED shows the remaining power in blocks of 10 percent. The Charge 100 Max can charge up to five gadgets at once, and the wireless charging pad on top is handy in the dark when you don’t want to fumble with cables. This is the outdoors pick in our Best Portable Chargers guide. —Simon Hill If your life goes well, you never have to use this thing and it just becomes some furniture for your trunk. But lord, what peace of mind if you leave your headlights on during a road trip through Wyoming. This model has saved the skin of a former WIRED reviewer on more than one occasion: a 1,000-amp, 12-volt battery pack with jump leads that’ll juice your battery in a bad situation. It also offers a USB-A port to charge your phone in a pinch, plus a built-in flashlight. This jump starter is often on sale below its list price of $130—but this is a good sale nonetheless. —Matthew Korfhage We particularly love Belkin’s BoostCharge Pro for its compact design and support for 15-watt wireless charging. The prongs also cling to your vent securely and the array of magnets allow for a strong hold with MagSafe-enabled iPhones. With a ball joint, you can also angle your phone slightly for a better view of the screen. Unfortunately, the USB-C cable is permanently attached. —Brenda Stolyar This is our top 3-in-1 wireless charger if you want to utilize Apple’s StandBy Mode. Introduced with iOS 17, it turns your iPhone into a smart display. With Twelve South’s charger, you can place it in landscape mode to trigger the feature while also simultaneously charging two other devices on the base such as your Apple Watch or AirPods. —Brenda Stolyar Belkin’s Stand Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with DockKit integration, which means it can use the iPhone’s camera to track your face while the 360-degree base automatically moves around to keep you in frame. It’s great for those who FaceTime a lot and find themselves searching for objects to prop the phone on. It’s also an excellent accessory for content creators who want to record hands-free video on the go. With a built-in battery, you don’t need to worry about being near a power source either. But with support for MagSafe, you can also use it as a charger. —Brenda Stolyar Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Mill food recycler just might be one of the most idiot-proof ways out there to dispatch food waste for those who don’t have access to municipal compost. Throw in food scraps (even meat!) and the Mill grinds and dries them into odorless, shelf-stable bits overnight. There’s a subscription program where you send the grounds off in the mail to be made into chicken feed, or you can use your grounds in the garden. We didn’t have the greatest success with that when we reviewed it earlier this year (6/10, WIRED Review), but we did find it to be a great device overall. —Kat Merck OK, so, full disclosure, we weren’t head over heels in love with the Bev (5/10, WIRED Review). But this is a really solid deal on it, and according to our scale, a score of 5/10 is “recommended with reservations.” This machine is like a Keurig, but for cocktails. If you fancy a mixed drink but don’t want to DIY it, simply supply your own liquor and pop in a capsule to make up a cocktail. You can also adjust the strength of your cocktail. We wish it took up less space on the counter, and that it could do a few tasks like pouring straight shots or shaking up drinks—but for this price, it’s a conversation starter worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The best air fryers help you cook quickly and potentially with less fat or oil. These compact convection ovens heat up fast to make crispy chicken, fries, and donuts. This Cosori model is our favorite smart air fryer because you can remotely control it using a smartphone or tablet (it also has a digital control panel). We like the slick, black, classy design. The cooking drawer has a smooth action, and the handle stays cool, though the sides can get hot, so it needs plenty of space. Temperature options range from 175 degrees Fahrenheit to a powerful 400, with 12 handy preset cooking modes. —Simon Hill Long ago, I used to think rice cookers were fundamentally the same. Then I bought my Zojirushi, with its fuzzy logic circuit that measures moisture and adjusts cooking time and temperature accordingly. Now all my rice tastes wonderful. This goes the same way with pilaf, congee, and coconut rice. This is among Zojirushi’s most basic models, but it has served me so well I’ve become a near-constant ambassador. And this is a terrific deal on it. —Matthew Korfhage The Nutribullet Ultra is one of the best blenders we’ve tested. It’s stylish and has simple controls, and the 1,200-watt motor is powerful enough to handle all your smoothies, dips, and sauces. The 30-second blend is usually enough to get through your ingredients, but you might have to run a second cycle if you want the smoothest consistencies. The five-year warranty and suction cup feet are icing on the cake. Er, smoothie. We’ve seen this blender drop to $90 before, but anything below $110 is a good deal. —Louryn Strampe The Typhur dome air fryer cooks with blazing speed and has a modern round shape that I enjoyed in my testing. It’s easy to clean and has intuitive controls. —Martin Cizmar The Braun MQ7 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic immersion blender. It’s a slightly older version of our favorite, but it’s still a great product, especially at this price. There’s a 500-watt variable-speed motor that responds to the pressure of your finger on the handle’s trigger. Press down fully for maximum speeds, or depress the trigger slightly for gentler blending. It’s comfortable to use and easy to clean, and it comes with a whisk attachment as well as a beaker for on-the-spot blending. —Louryn Strampe I love Cync's smart light bulbs, but the lights I use most by Cync are now the Undercabinet Pick Lights. They're easy to install under your cabinets, and easy to control over the app or a smart speaker. These undercabinet lights can do a variety of shades of whites, colors, and even fun effects that Cync calls Light Shows (my favorite is the candle option for moody fall lighting). They're usually $85, so this is a nice discount to get three pucks to put under your kitchen cabinets. I used four pucks for four cabinets, two on either side of my cabinets around my oven, so I recommend at least two packs if you have cabinets split up by an oven. —Nena Farrell As seen in our guide to the Best White Elephant Gifts, this funny little tumbler holds both cereal and milk separately to be enjoyed on the go without the cereal becoming soggy. There is a learning curve—small, spherical cereal bits like Cheerios work best; you must block part of the milk hole with your lower lip lest the milk flow outpace the cereal flow; and the whole contraption tends to leak if the lid isn’t twisted on at exactly the right angle. However, it’s available in seven different colors and makes a great gag gift or stocking stuffer for someone who either loves cereal or never has time to eat breakfast. —Kat Merck Instant-read thermometers are a kitchen essential. Can you prod your steak with a finger and accurately temp it? I think not. The Thermapen One will tell you the exact internal temperature in one second; no need for elaborate guesswork. Cheap instant-read thermometers litter Amazon, but we like the more expensive Thermapen One for its reliability and speed. The speed is important because the longer that oven door is open, the more unevenly you end up cooking. At this price, why not get the best? —Scott Gilbertson If you don't want to spring for the Thermapen above, the ThermoPop is a great budget option. It's not as fast, but it's still fast and the large, back-lit, auto-rotating screen is easy to read. It's waterproof, and accurate to plus or minus one degree. —Scott Gilbertson For those who want an air fryer but don’t want to devote the hefty counter space to a full-sized device, the WIRED Gear team’s favorite compact model is this nifty little Ninja, which is clocking in at a hefty Black Friday discount. The cooker is still quite versatile for a wee thing, with settings that include max crisp, air fry, air roast, air broil, bake, reheat, and dehydrate. Our tester even managed to successfully bake a little chocolate cake. —Matthew Korfhage If you’ve been meaning to cut down on single-use plastics, now’s your chance. We love Stasher’s silicone bags, which are reusable and versatile, whether you’re meal prepping, storing leftovers, or cooking sous vide (7/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re dishwasher and microwave-safe, leakproof, and designed to last through thousands of uses. At $9, it’s a small price to pay for a sustainable swap you’ll use daily. —Boutayna Chokrane Breville’s Smart Oven Pro air fryer and toaster oven is a remarkably versatile device, even among the new generation of combo ovens we’ve tested. It’ll roast you a 14-pound turkey. It’ll make pounds of less-greasy french fries or wings. It bakes cookies. And it fares surprisingly well at not just reheating pizza, but also making it in the first place. —Matthew Korfhage These aprons from Hedley & Bennett are the sort you might expect to find in professional kitchens—sturdy and waxed, and able to withstand a significant spill without leaving you with a wet belly button. They make great gifts—especially the themed aprons ranging from cutesy bagel aprons to surprisingly thoughtful Star Wars aprons. The whole site is 20 percent off for Black Friday. —Matthew Korfhage We’ve tested a lot of food processors, and this model from KitchenAid is the very best we’ve tried. It comes in four colors and has a solid 9-cup capacity which has enough room to make servings for a family of four. The blades and discs can be stored in the bowl and the base has storage for the cord. You’ll get a multipurpose blade, a dough blade, a slicing disc, a julienne disc, and a whisk accessory. This deal matches the best price we’ve tracked. —Louryn Strampe We like this budget-friendly food dehydrator and think it offers the best bang for your buck out of all the models we tested. The stackable BPA-free plastic rings are a little bulky and awkward to fit in the dishwasher, but everything we dehydrated dried evenly. If you don’t want to drop a ton of money on a food dehydrator, but you want one that works efficiently, this is a model worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe The Enso is the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall soda maker: durable, simple, sturdy, easy to use, and so intuitive you can make soda with one hand while skimming the news with your phone. If you use the HOLIDAY40 code on SodaStream’s website, it’s 40 percent off. —Matthew Korfhage This egg cooker fluctuates in price all the time, but this is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen it. It’s featured in our “Buy It for Life” guide. WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu says his wife loves this little countertop appliance, which can cook eggs in a myriad of different ways. Poach, soft-boil, hard-boil, or even whip up an omelet. It’ll chime to let you know when breakfast is served. It’s available in several cute colors like aqua, powder blue, and red. —Louryn Strampe As condiments go, Chengdu-based Fly By Jing is a luxury—a pricy and cheffy take on classic chili crisp that’ll add chili zip, fried-onion crunch; numbing Sichuan pepper; and wildly savory umami to pretty much anything from ice cream to noodles. (If you already know you’re a Fly By Jing fan, check out the brand’s advent calendar.) This is the best time to stock up or procure a gift for your favorite chilihead, with 20 percent or more off pretty much everything they make. Personally, I stick to the classic chili crisp, in the “big boi” size that comports with the volume of chili crisp I actually apply to my food. —Matthew Korfhage This excellent blender is durable and powerful. It’s got a generous 8-cup capacity and 10 blend settings. It gets pretty loud on the fastest setting, but our tester’s hummus was smooth in 30 seconds. The Braun has a touchscreen with several preset modes for things like smoothies, soups, spreads, frozen desserts, and more. The jar is made of Tritan, a type of impact-resistant plastic, rather than glass, but if that doesn’t bother you, this is a good deal on a reliable model. —Louryn Strampe How is a coffee warmer smart? Hint: It’s not because it uploads your habits to a cloud server. It’s smart because it turns itself on when you put a flat-bottomed coffee mug on top of it, and keeps your coffee warm at about 130 degrees. And it turns itself off when you remove the mug. So your coffee stays warm, and you don’t have to think about it. It makes for a great gift to anyone who likes, you know, warm beverages. —Matthew Korfhage It’s officially soup season, and what better way to get into the spirit than with the Philips Soup Maker (7/10, WIRED Review)? This bad boy can make so much soup. Also chilis, stews, purées, and smoothies. It’s kind of like an Instant Pot, if an Instant Pot was specifically for liquids. Choose your preferred texture, from chunky to creamy and more, and the machine will heat (or cool), blend, and stir the added ingredients to perfection. The machine is quiet and purpose-built. If you’re a soup enthusiast, or aspiring to be one, this deal is a goodie. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This is our favorite budget vacuum in our guide to Best Dyson Vacuums. A couple of years ago, the company updated the Motorbar Cleaner with its hair-detangling technology and hair screw tool. It has improved filtration too, with the ability to trap 99.99 percent of fine dust. This vacuum also converts into a hand vac, so you don’t have to buy a separate one. The battery should also last up to 40 minutes and takes about 5.5 hours to fully charge. If you're purchasing the vacuum from Kohl's, it's worth noting the sale ends at midnight. —Brenda Stolyar Dyson's V12 Detect Slim (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our favorite Dyson vacuum if you have a small space, like a studio apartment or one-bedroom. It’s compact and lightweight, weighing only five pounds and just four feet long, and it’s perfect for both stashing in a small space and for vacuuming just a room or two since it has a run time of up to 60 minutes. It also comes with a variety of attachments. All and all, it’s pretty powerful for such a compact size. —Nena Farrell The Gen5Detect is one of the latest vacuums in Dyson’s lineup. The company swapped the trigger for a single power button and the Laser Slim Fluffy cleaner head now shoots out a laser that’s twice as bright. It packs the fastest motor yet, too, spinning at 135,000 revolutions per minute (RPM) with a suction power of 265 air watts (AW). Dyson added a HEPA filter as well, which Dyson says traps 99.99 percent of particles down to 0.1 microns. —Brenda Stolyar If you’re not interested in one of Dyson’s standard vacuums, you can opt for a robot vacuum instead. With a spin speed of 110,000 RPM, this one is super powerful. It also has a digital display and a filter that’s easy to remove and clean. According to Dyson, it also has six times more suction than the competition. It also comes equipped with a “triple-action” brush bar, which includes soft nylon for large debris on hard floors, antistatic carbon-fiber filaments for fine dust, and stiff nylon bristles for carpet. —Brenda Stolyar This is our favorite budget pick, but we only recommend it if it’s on sale—so we don’t suggest waiting too long to snag it. It’s pretty basic compared to the other cordless stick vacs in Dyson’s lineup. Instead of a power button, it still comes with a trigger (so you’ll have to hold it down while vacuuming), and it comes with accessories like a Motorbar cleaner head, combination tool, and crevice tool. It’s unfortunately not compatible with the Laser Slim Fluffy Cleaner head (which shoots out a green laser to easily spot microscopic dust). It’s also not as powerful as the others, with a 120,000 RPM but it’s plenty for picking up dust and debris. —Brenda Stolyar This is currently our favorite robot vacuum. It has everything you need—reliable navigation with multi-floor mapping, a decent 8,000 Pa of suction, and multifunctional mopping and vacuuming—for a price that’s not totally insane. It uses lidar to navigate, which means you won’t have a camera creeping on your legs. Roborock’s SmartPlan—an AI-enabled feature that picks how to clean each surface in your house—also actually works! —Adrienne So There has never been a better time to buy a robot vacuum. Even as the technology advances by leaps and bounds, many older models remain perfectly capable—and sometimes more than grand cheaper. The Q5 Pro+ has now been supplanted by Roborock’s Qrevo line, but this was our top pick for over a year and Roborock vacuums age well. I have a 6-year-old Roborock on the upper story of my house that is still going strong. —Adrienne So After reviewing literally hundreds of products, the Petlibro Granary Smart Camera Feeder sticks out in my mind as one of my most beloved items I’ve ever tested. This reliable, tech-savvy, and highly customizable automatic feeder is the future helicopter pet parents want. The feeder is controlled via an app with a schedule you create, and the best part is that it has a camera so that you can watch and hear your pet eat even when far away—and you can communicate with them via speaker. —Molly Higgins Smart plugs are pretty darn cool. Anything becomes a smart device with their help—just plug in and bam—you can remote control it. The Kasa Smart Plug Mini is one of our favorite smart plugs since it’s nice and small, making it easy to use without blocking a neighboring outlet. Use the app to make routines and scenes like you would smart lights, so that your house comes to life for you, or to act like you're home when you aren't. Buy one on sale, or score an entire four-pack on sale and deck out the house. —Nena Farrell The best smart Christmas lights you can buy are on sale. Perfect timing if you need to upgrade. Easy to set up, with a black or green cord that blends nicely into the tree, Twinly’s lights support all kinds of colors and animated effects via the app, and you can also make custom effects. You can design based on an existing pattern, draw with your fingers, or even upload a GIF. Draped on a tree, the lights are best with gradient and stripe-style patterns, like the candy cane stripe effect. —Simon Hill I'm not surprised this frame is on sale—Skylight just launched a new version earlier this fall, and it's fantastic, allowing you to switch out the frame style at will. This original model is still a solid digital photo frame, and it’s the best sale price you’ll find right now on digital photo frames. —Nena Farrell Automatic curtains are a great way to wake in the morning with natural light and to keep the heat in or out if you live somewhere sunny. The trouble is they tend to be horribly expensive, but you can get retrofit solutions, like this third-generation SwitchBot device. It is easy to fit and works well if you have the right kind of drapes. In fact, this is our pick of the best retrofit options for automatic curtains in our best smart shades guide. Just keep in mind that you need two for a pair of curtains. —Simon Hill The Hatch Restore 2 has been trending for a reason. It's both a sunrise alarm clock and a fantastic sound machine, and it's beautiful to look at to boot. I think it's better as a sound machine than it is a sunrise alarm—it’s recommended as such in our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks—since it doesn't get quite as bright as our other picks to force you to rise or to double as a bedside lamp, but it does do a lovely range of colors and would still work in a very dark room. It's a great bedside gadget, and now it's on sale. —Nena Farrell This is a great little lamp that can transform the vibe of a room. All you have to do is plug it in and aim it toward the wall. It produces a halo-like effect with rainbow colors that make the space feel nice and cozy. (For a sunrise, check out our guide to the Best Sunrise Alarm Clocks.) It comes with a short cord though, so you’ll have to plug it into a power strip if you want it in a specific spot. I’d also make sure not to place it anywhere that someone can accidentally knock it over. —Brenda Stolyar OK, we know you know about Ember’s temperature-controlled mugs, but Ohom’s is a whole different—and much simpler—beast. It’s not overengineered; you don’t have to connect it to your phone, check an app, and get constant phone pings. Instead, it looks and feels exactly like your favorite ceramic mug and the set keeps your coffee at the temperature you want to drink. That’s it! The heating pad also works as a charging pad! Just don’t put the mug in the microwave (which you shouldn’t anyway, because that makes coffee taste gross) and you’re good to go. —Adrienne So I’ve had this boxy model in my kitchen for over two years now to mitigate some of the combustion particulates from my gas stove, and this is one of the best sales for it I’ve seen. I especially appreciate that its HEPA replacement filters are both easy to find and inexpensive (Amazon has them for $26 for two). WIRED contributor Lisa Wood Shapiro also notes in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers that it has an excellent air exchange rate for small rooms, cleaning the air in 361 square feet at the recommended rate of 4.8 times per hour. —Kat Merck The Airmega 250 from clean air leader Coway provides the industrial vibe your home or loft needs. The warm gray box looks like a high-end speaker. And the Airmega 250 can do four air exchanges an hour when fitted for a 465-square-foot room. Utilizing a HEPA filter, this CARB-certified air purifier also has a washable prefilter along with an activated carbon filter to capture odors and VOCs. It has a built-in air quality sensor with indicator light and an easy-to-use control panel. It’s not app-compatible but does have a three-year warranty and runs at a relatively quiet 22 decibels. —Lisa Wood Shapiro Bosch came out with its Air line of Energy Star- and CARB-certified air purifiers this summer, including small, medium, and large versions. Look for this large version (covers 2,745 square feet!) in our guide to the Best Air Purifiers. I’ve been using it on the main floor of my house that has 23-foot ceilings, and the difference in smells, dust, and overall air quality has been extremely noticeable. It’s also imperceptibly quiet with the fan running on the lowest speed. The only downside is the expensive filters that must be replaced every six to nine months. —Kat Merck Air quality is an invisible thing that can nonetheless have huge effects on how you feel. Might as well know how it’s going, right? The QP Pro Air Quality Monitor is less visual than some and the print’s a bit small, so it sits best on your desk or bedside table. But for that, there’s a lot of information: particulates, temp, CO2, humidity, volatile compounds, outdoor air quality index, hoo-boy. And even without a discount, the device is already low-priced amid its flashier competition. —Matthew Korfhage The “super plush” name is true to the core. This super-soft robe is what I grab after every shower—my towel just has hair duty these days. It's a cozy robe that can dry you off while you're doing your hair, and it dries nicely for my next shower. If I were shopping for a new one, I'd jump for one of the cute striped options. Brooklinen often runs sales, but 25 percent off this robe is better than you'll usually find. —Nena Farrell Nixplay is a classic in the digital photo frame world with a great screen and beautiful frame, but like many other digital photo frames we love, it's not a cheap investment. Except for right now, where you can get the touchscreen 10-inch Nixplay for the same price as cheap, crappy frames you'll find on Amazon. It's comparable to our favorite Aura frames, but for an extra-cheap price point right now. Plus, Nixplay plants a tree for every frame purchased. —Nena Farrell This versatile device is the pan-and-tilt pick in our best outdoor security camera guide. It’s ideal if you want a hands-off camera you can set up and leave to do its thing. The built-in solar panel keeps the battery topped off. The camera features a dual-lens system with a main lens that boasts a 135-degree field of view and records sharp video, paired with a telephoto lens that offers 3X zoom in the center of the frame (it goes up to 8X hybrid zoom). There’s also 8 GB of storage built-in to keep things local. The relatively low 15 FPS frame rate is disappointing, and the two-way audio quality is not great, but there is onboard AI and subject tracking. —Simon Hill This Arlo model has everything you need in an indoor security camera, including crisp 2K video at 24 frames per second, two-way audio, and a compact design that includes a privacy shutter. You can expect a quick loading feed in the Arlo app, useful smart notifications, and two-factor authentication, so you can log in with your fingerprint or face if your phone allows. Sadly, you need a pricey subscription (Arlo Secure costs $8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. This is the upgrade pick in our best indoor security cameras guide. —Simon Hill While it’s not our top pick, Google’s Nest Cam does make our list of the best outdoor security cameras and is a solid choice if you have a Nest Doorbell or other Google gadgets. The HD resolution is limited, but that’s offset by the HDR and high frame rate, and the face recognition is the best we have tested in a security camera. The Nest Aware subscription at $8 a month ($80/year) is too much if you only have a single camera, but that price covers multiple devices. —Simon Hill What makes this one of the best indoor security cameras you can buy is the face recognition. It can warn you when there’s a stranger in your home and tell you when your kids or partner get in. With HDR, the 1080p video quality is crystal clear at 30 fps, and there’s automatic night vision when it’s dark. You also get decent two-way audio and enforced two-factor authentication, which is important for an indoor camera. The big downside is that you need a Nest Aware subscription costing $8 per month ($80/year) for 30 days of event video history and familiar face alerts, but that covers all your Nest devices. —Simon Hill I love my Reolink doorbell, which does everything I need it to without the hassles of a glitchy app that needs to be updated every two weeks or any monthly fee. Don’t take my word for it, though: When my curling club needed a security system, another club member, who installs security cameras professionally, suggested we skip pricier options and just do a Reolink system. We’ve got an Reolink Altas PT Ultra (on sale for $160, which is $70 off) running inside over the bar and a solar-powered REOLINK Argus 4 Pro (on sale for $140 which is $80 off) running in the parking lot, which has drawn rave reviews based on the low cost (curling is a Scottish sport and thriftiness is part of the culture) and the fact that the whole leadership structure can access the footage from their phones via the Home Hub ($99). —Martin Cizmar A security camera kit is an easy way to get started with home security, and this Eufy one includes two cameras with a home hub. The upgrade pick for folks seeking a local, subscription-free system in our best outdoor security cameras guide, the EufyCam 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) has a lot going for it. Solar is built-in for battery top-ups, video resolution goes all the way up to 4K, and there's 16 GB of local storage (expandable up to 16 TB) on the connected HomeBase 3 hub. You also get on-device people, pet, and vehicle recognition, and this system can even recognize familiar faces, though it’s not as good at it as Google’s Nest cams. —Simon Hill There are so many good-quality, affordable security cameras on the market, and the Blink Mini 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of our favorites. It can record 1080p footage at up to 30 fps, offers decent low-light performance, and boasts on-device person detection. The catch is the subscription at $3 per month or $30 per year for a single camera, but it nets you a generous 60-day unlimited cloud video history. This camera is ideal for sitting unobtrusively on a shelf and keeping an eye on your home when you are away.—Simon Hill Mattresses are frequently advertised with inflated discounts, and this mattress from Nectar was only $100 more than this earlier in November. However, it’s still a big discount on an all-foam mattress that’s solidly on the soft side despite being advertised as “medium firm.” —Martin Cizmar The original millennial bed-in-a-box has been sold a few times in recent years and recently went through a full-line redesign. I was impressed with the new Casper baseline mattress during my week of testing, as it retains a classic memory foam feel but is more firm and supportive than many competitors. We originally linked the queen version but it's not available, other sizes are. —Martin Cizmar Our favorite budget bed frame, this option from AmazonBasics is great for first-time apartments or people with a ton of stuff. That’s because the 18-inch height leaves enough room under the bed for storage totes. You might still be cramming your shoes and off-season clothes under the bed, but at least you’ll have room to do it in an organized way. The durable frame folds down for easy transport and storage. And since it’s a platform, you won’t need a box spring either. —Louryn Strampe Buffy made a name for itself with its eucalyptus-based sheets and bedding—all of which are fantastic!—but I'm most in love with the brand's first cotton product, a set of percale sheets. Buffy's percale uses Supima cotton, which is a longer-staple cotton, making it extra soft while still retaining the crisp, breathable style of percale sheets. It's one of my favorite cooling sheets, and now a go-to for me even as a past percale hater. If you've been shopping for new percale sheets, snag these while they're on sale. —Nena Farrell Cozy Earth's Bamboo Sheet Set has been on the top of our Best Sheets guide ever since we started testing sheets, and it’s a star of our new Best Bamboo Sheets guide, too. These sheets, made with bamboo viscose, feel insanely soft and downright chilly to the touch before warming up like melted butter around you as you sleep. It's a downright decadent sheet set that's usually a splurge, which is why Cozy Earth's sale is the perfect time to shop. —Nena Farrell The Internet is suddenly full of filtered showerheads whose makers promise all sorts of health benefits if you use their filters. We can’t speak for most of these claims. But we do know that we’ve tested this Afina, and aside from being a pleasant, broad-spray showerhead (it’s installed in my bathroom as I write this), our testing showed it’s beautifully effective at removing abrasive chlorine from your water before it hits your hair and skin. In fact, it’s one of only two brands we tried that dropped total chlorine to undetectable levels. And for now, it’s available at a sweet discount. But, a word: filters will need replacing every two months, at $29 to $40. —Matthew Korfhage This handy little drill is a home tool kit essential. It’s got enough power to handle tasks that need extra torque, and the half-inch chuck will accept basically every drill bit size. This kit includes two batteries and a charger, and the batteries are also compatible with other DeWalt tools. This deal comes within $10 of the best we’ve seen. If you need bits, we recommend this kit, which is also on sale. —Louryn Strampe This inexpensive kit is full of our favorite drill bits. The black oxide coating both reduces friction and resists rust, and the drill bits can handle wood, metal, plastics, wallboard, and fiberglass. These go on sale frequently, but this is still a good Black Friday get, especially if you’re picking up the discounted DeWalt drill that we also recommend. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Branch’s Ergonomic Chair is my first recommendation for anyone who just wants to upgrade their crappy old seat without spending a fortune. It’s not perfect, but it’s quite adjustable, works for people of varying heights, and the high-density foam seat is cushy. You can lock the recline and adjust the lumbar support, and it helps that it’s also a very stylish office chair compared to its plain black competitors. For more discounts at Branch, read our separate story here. —Julian Chokkattu If your office chair budget is a little higher, then consider the Branch Verve. The main thing to note is that the arms are fixed—they can go up and down but not side to side. That’s my only real gripe with this chair; everything else is a nice upgrade over the Branch Ergonomic Chair, from build quality to back support. It also looks even more elegant, and there’s a headrest add-on if you want to shut your eyes and nap for a bit in between Zoom meetings. —Julian Chokkattu When it comes to writing, there’s nothing quite like the smooth 0.7 mm glide of the Paper Mate InkJoy Gel Pens. With 14 bold colors to choose from, this set is a rainbow of possibilities; whether you’re color-coding, writing in a planner, or doodling, their versatility and flair have earned them a permanent spot in our writing toolkit. —Boutayna Chokrane The Plum Paper A5 Planner is a gorgeous, customizable planner that lets you add themed pages to complement your life. Whether you want pages for meal planning, fitness tracking, or to journal your baby's growth, Plum Paper has it all. Those baby-related add-ons are why it’s my paper planner pick for parents. (It will cost you extra to add these things on, but it’s around $5-$10 per add-on.) Plum Paper also has a ton of gorgeous sticker packs to order, from seasonal to fitness or baby themes. You can get custom stickers, too, which is fun. It's a great planner if you want something truly specific to your life—my copy has a section just for my son!—and you can get your own for 30 percent off right now. —Nena Farrell The Ryzen 9 7950X is one of AMD’s most powerful CPUs, and is on a steep discount for Black Friday. Anyone building a new PC or looking to upgrade theirs for raw computing power will want to check out this 16-core, 32-thread monster. The already ultra-fast 4.5GHz base clock can be pushed even higher with overclocking, making this an excellent choice for demanding workloads like video editing or 3D rendering. It’s also the perfect counterpart to a high-end GPU for the best possible experience in any video game. —Brad Bourque Logitech has a long history of great keyboards, and the MX Mechanical Mini is no exception. This wireless keyboard packs backlit keys, wired or wireless connectivity, and low-profile mechanical switches in your choice of tactile quiet, clicky, or linear. If you’ve got tons of devices, you should know the MX Mini also has wide support for operating systems and devices, including iOS. That makes this one of our favorite upgraded keyboards for tablet power users who want to unfold for a bit into a proper workstation. —Brad Bourque Topping our best routers guide, this affordable router combines a slick design with reliable performance. It’s only a dual-band (2.4-GHz and 5-GHz) router, but should be fast enough for most folks and will cover an average-sized home with an internet connection of 1 Gbps or less. Ample connectivity includes four gigabit Ethernet LAN ports, a single gigabit WAN port, and a USB 3.0 port on the back. The setup is simple, TP-Link’s Tether app is easy to use, and basic security and features like QoS (Quality of Service) are included. —Simon Hill Anyone looking for an upgraded power supply should take a gander at the Corsair RM1000x. This full-size PSU can support up to 1,000 watts at 80 plus gold efficiency, which should be more than enough for most systems. It’s fully modular, for ease of installation and upgrading, or just for adding your own custom cables, and sports a 135-mm magnetic fan with a zero RPM mode for almost silent running. It’s not the biggest discount in the world, but enough to make it worth it for system builders who have waited patiently for prices to drop. —Brad Bourque The best Wi-Fi 6E router in our best routers guide, this hexagonal Asus router impressed in my tests. It’s a tri-band router, adding the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz. The new band is very fast, though it is relatively low range and doesn’t penetrate through walls very well. There’s ample connectivity with a 2.5-Gbps WAN/LAN port, a second 1-Gbps WAN/LAN, and a further three gigabit LANs. Asus also offers free security and parental controls and all the settings you need in the mobile app and browser interface, including band-splitting, prioritization for different activities, guest network, VPN support, and so on. —Simon Hill Simple to set up and use, Amazon's Eero mesh systems are easy to recommend and can act as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The tri-band Eero Pro 6E (7/10, WIRED Recommends) mesh adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. It’s a great choice for busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection. Performance is excellent, but the 6-GHz band is short-range. The Eero Plus subscription is expensive ($10 per month or $100 per year) but includes comprehensive parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Folks with smaller homes and connections up to 500 Mbps, should consider the Eero 6 (3-Pack) on sale at $150 ($50 off), but the more heavily discounted Eero 6+ (3-Pack) at $195 ($105 off) is a better deal if you can afford it. —Simon Hill This affordable security camera is our pick of the best indoor security cameras because it offers clear 2K footage, with a starlight sensor that enables color night vision. Smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles) is handy, and the slightly laggy two-way audio is fine. Pop in a microSD card (up to 512 GB) for local recording, or opt for a Tapo Care subscription for 30 days of cloud storage that starts at $3.50 per month. It also has an IP66 rating so it can be used outdoors. —Simon Hill Gamers don’t need a special gaming router, but if you love customizable RGB lighting, this mesh will tempt you. It’s not just fancy lighting that makes it worth a look, because this tri-band Asus ROG Rapture GT6 finished high up the table in most tests. With a single 2.4-GHz band and two 5-GHz bands (one is used for backhaul unless you connect the routers with an Ethernet cable), it can keep all your gaming gear online. The 5-GHz band supports wider 160-MHz channels and WPA3 for security. You also get AiProtection security software and comprehensive parental controls included without a subscription. The game modes boost performance and prioritize gaming traffic, and each router has a 2.5 Gbps WAN port, three 1 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.2 Gen 1 port. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Asus Chromebook Plus CX34 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the best-looking Chromebook you can buy. The beautiful white design stands out in a sea of gray slabs. The Core i5 CPU offers plenty of performance to easily handle multiple tabs and app juggling. The webcam is nice too, much crisper than you’d expect for a $500 laptop. The downside is there's no backlit keyboard. —Scott Gilbertson The 13-inch Surface Laptop (7th Edition) (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite processor. Performance was good in our testing. It did not bog down no matter how many windows, tabs, and apps we threw at it. That said, this is not a machine for graphics-intensive tasks, like video editing or gaming (which is a shame because the vivid sharp screen with a 120-Hz screen refresh rate would be great for gaming). —Scott Gilbertson Do you think of a laptop as metal framing around a web browser? Consider a Chromebook. Google rolled out a big upgrade called Chromebook Plus in 2023. The “Plus” stands for better performance—faster processors, more memory, more storage, and better video cameras. Our favorite of the models we've tried is Lenovo's Flex 5i Chromebook Plus (8/10, WIRED Recommends). It's among the fastest Chromebooks we've tested for the money. It features a 3.75-GHz Intel Core i3-1315U CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of flash storage. —Scott Gilbertson There's much to love about Samsung's Galaxy Book4 (7/10, WIRED Review), but let's be honest, that sticker price is insane. This deal brings it down somewhat, though it's still pricey. You do get impressive hardware—the new Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and current top-of-the-line processor in Intel’s Core Ultra CPU lineup, along with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card. The 16-inch AMOLED 2,880 x 1,800 pixels touchscreen is magnificent to work on and performance blew everything else we've tested out of the water. —Scott Gilbertson The Swift Go offers outstanding performance for the price (7/10, WIRED Review). It also boasts an impressive 15-hour battery life. The downside is the speakers, which aren't great, and overall the body feels a little plasticky. But this is the least expensive Intel Core Ultra laptop we've tested by a few dollars, so if the budget is tight, the Swift Go is worth considering. —Scott Gilbertson Dell's two larger XPS laptops (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are aimed at Windows users with MacBook jealousy. The design, specs, and sizes align perfectly with Apple's offerings. The XPS 14 has a gorgeous, sleek design (though it's thicker than a MacBook), a wonderfully bright and sharp OLED screen (with 120-Hz screen refresh rates), and is plenty speedy for everyday tasks. Unfortunately, heavy-duty tasks like video editing … well, the MacBook's benchmarks run circles around the XPS 14. Still, with this deal, this is a serious piece of hardware for not a lot of money. —Scott Gilbertson The ReMarkable 2 is a great digital notebook—so great that it’s No. 1 in our Best Digital Notebooks guide. I find myself grabbing it daily to write down all kinds of things—grocery lists! To-do lists! Ideas for novels I'll never write!—or upload PDFs for me to read and edit. It's pricey, though, making this Black Friday sale super exciting. This on-sale bundle includes the Marker Plus, which has an eraser on the end for you to easily edit your notes without needing to switch between your tools on the page. Choose a bundle with the folio of your choice—I love the Type Folio for taking more detailed notes or mixing up my writing screen of the day, but the Book Folio has a better price—to get the sale price. —Nena Farrell This is a fantastic and simple full-size mechanical keyboard that employs Cherry’s new MX2A switches. There’s no USB-A port, hot-swap sockets, any kind of programmability, or even a dial, so it really is barebones, but it excels in its function as a well-built wired keyboard, and it’s affordable. —Julian Chokkattu Who says you always have to buy the latest and greatest? If you get a tablet from Samsung’s 2023 Tab S9 series, you can save some serious cash and get an equally great experience (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Tab S9 is the smallest, and next comes the Tab S9+, both of which have AMOLED screens and are IP68-rated for water resistance. The Tab S9 Ultra is down to $800 ($400 off), and it’s massive and designed to be a travel-friendly computer when you don’t want to lug a laptop around. Also, check out the Galaxy Tab S9 FE and Galaxy Tab FE+. If you just want a tablet to watch some shows, read, and play some games, these affordable slates are better than their predecessors, with smoother performance, and you still get a stylus in the box. They’re nearly identical—the FE+ just has more RAM and a bigger screen. —Julian Chokkattu The Galaxy Tab S10 series is the iPad Pro-equivalent of the Android world. The Tab S10+ has a reasonable 12.4-inch screen size, but the Tab S10 Ultra sports a massive 14.6-inch screen that is unwieldy to hold—you’ll want to pair it with a kickstand case. The Ultra is on sale for $1,000 ($200 off), but the Tab S10+ is much better value overall. You get the S Pen included for doodling and note-taking, the AMOLED screen is stunning, and it will receive 7 years of software updates. My primary issue is the price, and it’s still expensive at $850, but if you want the best tablet Android has to offer, this is it. —Julian Chokkattu Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Ray (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is the oddest little soundbar in the Sonos lineup, but at this price, it’s a slam dunk for the right buyer. Unlike its siblings and nearly all modern offerings on our best soundbars list, the Ray doesn’t offer HDMI connection, using optical input instead. That means it won’t automatically work with your TV remote and it doesn’t even come with one of its own. That said, it can be programmed to work with most modern remotes. Alternatively, you can control it via the Sonos app, which unlocks tons of other features like Spotify Connect, Apple AirPlay 2, and the ability to link up with other Sonos speakers as part of a whole-home system. Those are features soundbars at this price level almost never include. But the Ray’s best feature is its excellent sound, pumping out clear, musical, and surprisingly meaty audio for a bar proportioned more like a Bluetooth speaker. –Ryan Waniata This is the Bar 1300X (8/10, WIRED Recommends) deal I’ve been waiting for. If you’ve been after transformative Atmos immersion in a large-and-in-charge soundbar system, your time is now. The 1300X’s standout feature is its removable, battery-powered surrounds that can detach from the main bar as surround speakers when needed, or reattach, charge, and play as part of the larger bar. They’ll even work as standalone Bluetooth speakers. It’s a cool feature, but the 1300X’s Dolby Atmos performance is even cooler. You’ll feel like you're there when the up-firing speakers get rolling, putting you in a dome of sound. Music also sounds great, and the included subwoofer provides power and poise for everything you play. The app is a little lackluster for sound adjustments, but otherwise, I’ve got nothing but kudos for this uniquely versatile setup. —Ryan Waniata Bose’s Smart Soundbar (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is my favorite mini bar, even if it’s on the pricier side for a small bar that doesn’t come with a dedicated subwoofer. That means you’re sacrificing some punch down low, but in its place you’re getting fantastic immersion thanks to true upfiring drivers (something the Sonos Beam doesn’t have), Wi-Fi streaming and networking, and some innovative audio features. Those include a new AI dialog mode that brings forth voices and center-channel information with remarkable clarity. You can also now use the brand’s Open Earbuds as clip-on personal surround speakers. The Bose app is simple and intuitive, and lets you easily add other speakers like a Bose Bass module down the line. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ indomitable Arc (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has new competition from within courtesy of the Arc Ultra, which offers subtle but impactful sonic improvements and the ability to connect over 5GHz Wi-Fi. At $1,000, though, it’s not the best fit for all budgets. The regular Arc is still a winner, providing full and warm sound, excellent detail for dialog and music, and impressive immersion for surround sound and Dolby Atmos soundtracks via side- and up-firing drivers. Like other Sonos gear, you can add surround speakers or the new Sub 4 subwoofer, or connect with other speakers for all the multi-room audio tricks upon which Sonos made its name. You’ll also get built-in microphones for smart home control. Though Sonos’ app has had its struggles lately, it seems to be on more solid ground. If you’ve been waiting on a potent standalone bar with room for larger aspirations, this Arc deal is worth grabbing. —Ryan Waniata Klipsch’s Flexus Core 200 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) sounds bigger and brawnier than you’d expect for the money, pushing toward bars that cost twice as much. Its MDF construction (in place of plastic) offers deep and musical resonance, and its upfiring drives expand the sound to accentuate Dolby Atmos films and TV shows to cinematic heights (literally). Dialog is also clear and present thanks to a dedicated center channel. The trade-off is that there’s no Wi-Fi support as you’d expect for this price, but the bar is not without its innovative extras. As the name implies, the system provides flexible expansion with available surround speakers and a thumpy subwoofer. This bar is one of the best soundbars around for those who put sound quality first at full price, and a true bargain on sale. —Ryan Waniata It’s not the latest and greatest soundbar that we have tested, but the Signa S4 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a slim bar with a relatively large wireless subwoofer that makes it great for action fans. I do wish it had Wi-Fi for music streaming, but as long as you connect it to your TV, you can just use the apps on there for that. —Parker Hall Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The AirPods Pro (8/10, WIRED Recommends) come with a bunch of useful features including Conversation Awareness (which lowers your music and background noise when you're having a conversation), Adaptive Transparency mode (that combines noise cancellation and transparency to adjust audio), and support for Find My in case you lose them. They also have above-average sound quality, with excellent noise cancellation, crisp highs, and authoritative bass. —Brenda Stolyar The wait for the AirPods Max (8/10, WIRED Recommends) with USB-C is finally over. Aside from the updated charging port, these are identical to the Lightning version (also on sale)—complete with great noise cancellation, a massive soundstage, and rich bass. They also pack great build quality, with a mesh headband and fabric earcups. The USB-C version also comes in a few new colors, including starlight, orange, purple, blue, and midnight. —Brenda Stolyar If you have an iPhone, the workout buds you need are still the Beats Fit Pro. (If it’s not broke, why fix it?) These everyday buds fit remarkably well, even in my tiny ears, with flexible fins. The H1 chip pairs seamlessly with all Apple products, and they sound great! I have gone running and accidentally put my head under a faucet while wearing these and they still work great. For more Apple-specific picks, check out our guide to the Best AirPods. —Adrienne So Ever since it was bought by Apple, Beats has been churning out some of the world’s most underrated earbuds. The Studio Buds + are no exception, with noise canceling, excellent integration with iPhones, and a more comfortable fit than you’ll get from AirPods Pro. They’re also better for workouts, thanks to built-in earfins that keep the IPX4-rated headphones in your ears. —Parker Hall It’s hard to think of a more stalwart consumer electronics product over the last decade than Sony’s WH-1000XM4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends). Even four years after their debut, they serve as a benchmark for new contenders and premium offerings from top players alike. Their noise canceling isn’t top tier, but it’s still very good, and a raft of features—from a multi-band EQ to a touch control that turns on transparency mode temporarily for announcements or quick conversations—makes them feel advanced even as they gracefully age. Their sound is warm and bassy, yet refreshingly refined, and their durable plastic shells harbor plush padding for hours of comfort. You can outdo these noise cancelers with the latest Bose QuietComfort Ultra or Sony’s step-up WH-1000XM5, but there’s no question as to why Sony’s kept them around for multiple generations. —Ryan Waniata Soundpeats has a knack for making affordable earbuds with exceptionally good sound. In fact, we recently gave their latest pair that uses a new kind of driver, the Soundcapsule 3+, a perfect 10/10. The Air4 Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) are not that pair, but they serve up clear and balanced sound along with solid noise canceling for a very low asking price. They don’t have the spoils you’ll get in flagships like the AirPods Pro (even if they look a lot like them), but for well below $100 they’re a worthy option that could make a great gift for the budding music lover in your life. —Ryan Waniata Need a cheap pair of earbuds to not think too much about? Look no further than the Go Air Pop, which are utterly usable earbuds that cost less than $20 this Black Friday. I like keeping a pair in my car or gym bag for when I forget to bring nicer buds with me and still want music. —Parker Hall These affordable earbuds from Nothing (8/10, WIRED Recommends) are among my favorite cheap headphones right now. They come in a cool clear plastic case and feature cool yellow accents, and they offer virtually every feature you can expect from high-end buds these days. You get noise canceling, comfortable eartips, and honest-to-God decent sound quality overall. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a pair of buds that are definitively better than these, even for nearly double this price. —Parker Hall Bose’s QuietComfort Ultra headphones (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are premium in style and performance, as you’d expect from the best noise-canceling headphones on the market. Their plush and ergonomic design makes them a joy to wear, while their penchant for noise-strangling makes them the ultimate choice for serious travelers or those who simply need unparalleled tranquility in their home or office. I also really enjoy the sound, which is less forward than Bose flagships past, while still providing excellent instrumental separation and deft balance. The battery provides a solid 30 hours per charge and the headphones add futuristic features like 3D audio virtualization with head-tracking to feel more like a pair of speakers. At well over $400, these are a serious splurge, but at this price they feel more like a steal. —Ryan Waniata The Jabra Elite series have been our top pick in our guide to workout headphones for years. Unfortunately, the company recently decided to stop making them. Although the earbuds have an unusually long two-year warranty, some of my colleagues would counsel you not to pick them. However, these are still the most comfortable and secure workout headphones that I’ve tried. They have an unusual feature, which is that you can plug the case into a 3.5-mm headphone jack to listen to them on a plane. It’s neat! These are still great for travel! —Adrienne So Jabra’s Elite 4 Active (9/10, WIRED Recommends) were almost shockingly good upon release a couple of years back, and they’re still an excellent buy today–especially on sale. As part of Jabra’s sporty overhaul, they blend serious durability with a comfy fit, smooth and balanced sound, and plenty of ways to personalize the experience in the Jabra app. They even provide a slab of noise canceling, though it’s more of an aid to their noise-isolating fit. They’re also dust and water-resistant, meaning you can dunk them or rinse them after a sweaty workout with no ill effects. Jabra has called it quits on consumer earbuds, but the stalwart brand pledges to support its current products through its warranty, so there’s no reason to hesitate. —Ryan Waniata Sony’s WH-1000XM5 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) take nearly everything we loved about the previous model a step further, offering a mix of fabulous features and excellent noise canceling, comfort, and sound quality. These headphones have everything, from multipoint pairing and auto-pause sensors to brilliant touch commands and Amazon Alexa support. They’re perfect for travel, but just as handy for wearing around the house. They’re not quite as packable as the previous model, the XM4, but that’s really the only flaw in an otherwise near-perfect package. —Ryan Waniata These classic wired headphones have been in style since the moment they came out decades ago. The cool metal headband meets molded plastic earcups with vintage-style foam ear coverings, making these the best headphones ever to play with your CD or cassette player. —Parker Hall Hearing damage is no joke, and it’s permanent. I’ve loved carrying these cheap earplugs from Earpeace on my keychain for when things get too loud, whether at a concert or elsewhere. They’re cheap, and they really do better with wide frequency ranges than the foam earplugs you’re probably most used to. If you always find yourself wishing you brought a pair, now is a good time to snag them. —Parker Hall The Beats Studio Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) were solid headphones at full price, but after dropping a full $100 to around $250 on average, they became a lot more appealing. Now they’ve slipped even further, moving closer to the “gotta grab” category thanks to a mix of engaging sound and impressive usability. Extras include solid noise canceling, brilliant transparency mode, Apple-centric extras like “Hey, Siri” voice commands, and one-touch pairing for iPhone or Android devices. Their build isn’t as posh as premium models from Sony or Bose, but at a fraction of the price, they’re the better buy for tighter budgets. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The WIRED Gear team battles over who gets to review each generation of this adorable Bluetooth speaker, because it’s just so handy. A tiny little rubber strap lets you attach it to everything from handlebars to backpacks. It sounds shockingly good for its size, too, and a rugged IP67 rating means you don’t need to worry if it takes a spill. —Parker Hall Ultimate Ears makes some of our favorite speakers, and the Boom series is a standout. An update of the relatively ancient Boom 3, the Boom 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) brings long-awaited USB-C charging and modestly redesigned drivers. Its performance offers the same clear, smooth, and balanced presentation we’ve come to expect from the series. You’ll also get up to 15 hours of battery life, the ability to stereo pair with another Boom 4, and plenty of ways to adjust the sound in the app. This isn’t the bassiest speaker for its size, but its sound is more refined than cheaper knock-offs. Its primary drawback is its high price, which makes now the right time to strike. —Ryan Waniata Everyone needs a good pair of computer speakers, especially if you work from a home office. These desktop speakers from Audioengine have wired and Bluetooth connectivity, and they have front ports for better bass when placed against a wall or on a desktop. They’re not the newest model ever, but they’re still our favorite. —Parker Hall The best Bluetooth speakers offer a mix of durability, sound quality, and aesthetics, which is exactly how I’d describe this mid-tier model from Ultimate Ears. The folks who design these spend a lot of time testing their limits, from drop tests to bleach testing them in the desert sun, and that makes them great for folks who tend to be harder on consumer electronics. If you have a fisherman, hunter, or contractor in your life, UE is the brand for you. —Parker Hall Round Bluetooth speakers like this one might seem hard to place, but the built-in leather strap that comes with the Beosound A1 makes it very easy to hang anywhere you might need to. It’s a very well-made speaker, with a sleek metal exterior that can survive a heck of a lot of abuse. The normal downside is the price, which is negated this Black Friday. —Parker Hall JBL’s Authentics 200 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) speaks fluent Google and Alexa, letting you pick your smart home poison. That means it can act as a controller for multiple types of smart home products without the need for unifying smart protocols like Matter. The speaker’s stylish retro design provides further appeal, with a chunky foam grille reminiscent of JBL’s ’70s audiophile designs and real knobs for EQ and volume. Most important, the Authentics sounds fantastic, with warm and vibey mids, crisp treble, and wavy bass you can feel through the floor when it gets humming. Sonos models like the Era 100 and Era 300 are top of mind for most seeking an acoustically sound Wi-Fi speaker, but don’t sleep on the 200, especially at this new low price. —Ryan Waniata Ultimate Ears makes some of the best Bluetooth speakers you can buy, and the Everboom (7/10, WIRED Reviewed) is another solid option with a slightly inflated price. This sale brings it in line with more competitors. The Everboom has a few upgrades over siblings like the Megaboom 4, including slightly louder peak volume and extra bass, making it a mildly better choice for letting things fly at outdoor gatherings. It offers similar features elsewhere, including the ability to connect with up to 150 other UE speakers, a customizable EQ, and even a megaphone feature that lets you call through the speaker from the app. It's rugged, it’s weatherproof, and on sale, it’s a solid deal that’s worth adding to your arsenal. —Ryan Waniata Sonos’ new app has made headlines for its troubles, but I’ve had the Era 300 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) on my network since it launched and never had an issue with it. The company seems to have mostly shored up its app issues elsewhere, letting the Era 300’s sound performance shine as it should. This Dolby Atmos-ready speaker can create a big and spacey soundstage with 3D audio tracks, and sounds fantastic with stereo music too, providing clear and intimate detail with deep bass. The speaker is loaded with features, including voice control via Alexa and Sonos’ built-in system, tons of streaming options, and the ability to connect with other Sonos speakers in a whole-home or surround sound configuration. That’s a lot of good stuff at an equally good sale price. —Ryan Waniata The only real downside to JBL’s best Bluetooth speakers is their high price. Grabbing them on a good sale is key, which makes this Clip 5 deal a top target. The perfect shower speaker does much more than just belt out your morning tunes. Its titular clip makes it easy to bring camping, attach it to your bike, or even clip it on your belt buckle as you clean up your yard or take the dog for a spin. The sound is full and surprisingly warm, with good detail and more bass than most pint-size rivals. Other features include 12 hours of battery (or 15 hours with the battery saver mode) and JBL’s handy app for adjusting the sound or connecting with other JBL models. —Ryan Waniata I loved the new Pill (8/10, WIRED Recommends) at full price, and at $100 or less it’s arguably the best value for a bass-thumping portable out there. The speaker matches musical low-end poise with swift instrumental attacks and vivid high-register detail. At times it pushes toward sharpness, but mainly stays free to provide an exhilarating sound signature with plenty of punch. It adds loads of features, including high-res audio support via USB-C input, one-touch pairing for Android or iOS, and 24 hours of battery life per charge, to make it among the best you can buy. It’s all encapsulated (sorry) in a premium design with IP67 weather protection for outdoor adventures. —Ryan Waniata Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Fellow Aiden (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is one of the most talked about coffee devices this year. It’s a sleek update on the classic Mr. Coffee from the 1970s: A drip machine to make drip coffee seem kinda cool again. It’s easy to use, it can be customized to each roast or bean with a simple dial twirl, and our reviewer marveled at how good the coffee was. The device is on sale for Black Friday, but only if you also buy a bean grinder. Luckily, the Fellow Opus is also the WIRED Gear team’s favorite overall grinder in existence. —Matthew Korfhage The Breville Barista Express is the lowest priced all-in-one espresso maker and frother we’ve found that’ll compete with the thousand-dollar big boys—a sturdy machine with precision, power, grace, and staying power. This is a longtime Gear team favorite: WIRED reviewer Julian Chokkattu has kept this on his counter for a half-decade. The slightly upgraded Pro version is also on sale this weekend, for about hundred more. —Matthew Korfhage The Terra Kaffe is a pricey hunk of coffee machinery and has its bugs, but it’s one of few on earth to offer not just quality espresso and macchiato, but also true drip coffee that’s not Americano in disguise. This all arrives in a nifty, easy-to-clean package with a smart screen and all the trimmings. Using a phone app, you can begin warming the machine up from your bed, just like a remote starter on your car. Anyway, it’s a whopping $500 off till December 15, with an extra hundo off the top if you sign on for a coffee subscription. —Matthew Korfhage The Cafe Barista was already our budget pick among fully automated cafe and espresso machines, and right now it’s on significant discount. If you don’t mind the plasticky casing, this low-cost device will make you a rich single or double espresso with a single push of the button, not to mention lattes and cappuccinos. —Matthew Korfhage This is the best bean grinder we’ve found under $100, hands down. At the moment, it costs even less than that. At 16 inches high, the Oxo is a little tall to fit under a kitchen cabinet. But it’s durable, and it’s got a slim profile and a truly surprising ability to dial down to fine espresso grinds. —Matthew Korfhage No tamping, no grinding. Just fill the Cafe Affetto with beans, make sure the water tank has water, and push the button. Voila: a lovely, no-fuss espresso. The Affetto is a slick, fully automatic machine with a built-in steaming wand, 20 bars of pump pressure, and a small profile that preserves counter space. We’ve seen lower prices from less-than-verified sellers, but this Black Friday discount is a terrific deal on a solid all-in-one espresso maker. —Matthew Korfhage The Tally (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a scale for true coffee nerds. Sure, it weighs your coffee. It’ll also set a timer to track weight during a pour-over, for the true beanheads. Even more fun, the “Brew assist” mode will let you enter your desired coffee-to-water ratios and simul-calculate how much water you’ll need for the perfect brew as you weigh out your beans. Is this all a bit much? Sure—unless you’re a total nerd. Y’all know who you are. WIRED contributor Joe Ray loved the scale’s intuitive design. Like most Fellow coffee gear during Black Friday weekend, the Tally is 20 percent off right now. —Matthew Korfhage Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals It’s very easy to see why the Kindle Paperwhite is Amazon’s most popular model. The 12th-generation model (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes with a larger display (7 inches instead of 6.8), the highest contrast ratio on any Kindle (for sharp text and images), and three months of battery life (an increase from two months on its predecessor). It’s also the thinnest yet. We recommend it to anyone who is buying their very first Kindle. The Signature Edition is also on sale for $155, which comes with double the storage, auto-adjust brightness, and support for wireless charger. —Brenda Stolyar Even without the discount, the basic Kindle was already the most affordable option. And now, it’s under $100. The latest version is an iterative update compared to the 2022 model but it does come with a higher contrast ratio, a 25-percent-brighter front light at the highest setting, and a faster page-turn rate. It’s also the smallest Kindle, making it easy to hold one-handed and to travel with. It comes in a super fun matcha color, too. —Brenda Stolyar The latest kid-friendly Kindles received the same treatment as the rest of Amazon’s lineup—with a faster page-turn rate, a brighter screen, and a higher contrast ratio. This discount is for the basic model, which is small and compact. It also comes with a variety of kid-friendly covers to choose from. But the Paperwhite Kids is also on sale for $140 ($40 off). It comes with a larger display that’s better for reading graphic novels. Plus, it’s waterproof so you won’t have to worry about those accidental spills as much. Both models also come with six months of access to Kids+, Amazon’s subscription service for age-appropriate books, and a two-year warranty. —Brenda Stolyar Fire Tablets aren't great, but then again they're only $75 on sale—what do you want for that price? If all you plan to do is watch Amazon content and do basic tasks like email and browsing the web, they are reasonably capable and certainly affordable. The Fire HD 10 is our favorite of the bunch, with a 1080p screen and 3 gigabytes of RAM so it can handle watching videos and browsing with quite a few tabs open. —Scott Gilbertson The Fire HD 10 Kid's Edition is exactly the same as the regular above, but it comes with a handy protective case (with kickstand), one year of Amazon Kids+, and, most importantly, a very few questions asked warranty for when your kids accidentally drop it. Parental controls on Amazon's tablets are limited, but offer some control over content (see our guide for more details). —Scott Gilbertson The best value in the Fire tablet lineup, the HD 8 was updated earlier this year with more RAM (3GB) and a better 5 megapixel camera. It retains the same form factor, and battery life is still rated at 13 hours, although we rarely got over 11 in our testing. Storage options are either 32 GB or 64 GB, but I'd say stick with the cheaper of the two and add a microSD card (up to 1-TB, we like this Samsung card, also on sale for $27). —Scott Gilbertson The Fire Max 11 (5/10, WIRED Review) is the most powerful tablet in the Fire lineup, almost like Amazon decided to make a real tablet. The problem is, despite being speedy and capable on the hardware side, it's still crippled by Amazon's subpar Fire OS. At full price we don't recommend this one, however, now that it's down to $140, it's a good deal. It's capable, much sleeker than the rest of the Fire tablets, and if you want to be more productive with it, the bundle with a keyboard is also on sale for $225 ($125 off). —Scott Gilbertson The Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen) is truly tiny yet powerful. It’s the Alexa smart speaker I find myself always having set up somewhere in my house, even if I’m testing other voice assistants. This smart speaker might only be a few inches tall, but its audio quality can almost rival the larger Echos. The small footprint makes it easy to add almost anywhere in your home, too. The only downside is the price for such a small speaker, but it's on major sale for Black Friday. —Nena Farrell If you want a smart display, this is the Goldilocks of the lot. The Echo Show 8 is the perfect size with its 8-inch screen to use for all kinds of features—smart home control, music player, video calls, even a little movie streaming—and packs a great speaker, a smart home hub, and a 13 MP camera. Use it as a digital photo frame, a smart home control center, or just a music jam session. Not only is this smart display fantastic, but it's nearly half off right now and available for the best price we've seen all year. —Nena Farrell The Echo Pop (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is the cheapest Amazon Echo speaker on a normal day, and it's the only one you'll find for under $20 this Black Friday. It's downright adorable, with a half-moon shape and a couple of fun colors you won't find in other Amazon speakers. It's not the most impressive speaker—no surprise with the smaller form factor it has—but it's not bad for the price, plus you'll get all the usual features of a smart speaker in it. —Nena Farrell Amazon's lineup of smart speakers is huge, but it all started with the true Amazon Echo. The fourth-gen model has an orb shape, rather than the tower of the first few models. But the updated shape also comes with fuller sound that can better fill a room, and a built-in smart home hub that can connect to your devices directly over Matter or Zigbee. It's a great speaker and smart assistant, and the twilight blue color is on sale for half off. You can also find the black and white colors on sale for $5 more. —Nena Farrell Not to quote my own review, but the Amazon Echo Spot (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is small yet surprisingly helpful. This second-gen model is back after being discontinued, with an updated look that matches the vibe of the Echo Pop that launched last summer (that's on sale too!). I was surprised how much I liked it—it takes my favorite quick-glance smart display features, showing me the weather and my calendar when I ask, and leaves out all of the clutter. It's a solid speaker for casual listening, though the Echo Dot is still the best of the pint-sized Amazon speakers. It's ideal for a bedside table, but I also liked it for my desk. It's on sale for almost half off, so it's a great time to get one if you want it. —Nena Farrell Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Omnilux Contour LED face mask is soft and flexible, making it easy to wrap around your face. With its 132 LED lights that reach 633 nanometers of red light, it’s designed to stimulate collagen production and help fix fine lines. It doesn’t have a blue light version like other LED masks we recommend, but it’s the best price you’ll find right now on an LED mask. —Nena Farrell The NuDerma Therapy Wand, now $59, is an affordable way to elevate your skincare routine for about less than half the cost of a single facial. Its neon-powered applicators stimulate circulation and oxygenate your skin, leaving it feeling refreshed and hydrated. Use it after applying your serums and creams to enhance their potency. —Boutayna Chokrane The Canopy is our overall favorite among the suddenly ubiquitous filtered showerheads that now promise to remove all sorts of things from your water, presumably keeping your hair and skin more lustrous. Unlike many such filters, we discovered during testing that the Canopy does in fact remove troublesome chlorine compounds before its spray hits your hair and skin. It's also a good-looking showerhead with multiple spray settings and a lot of considerate touches that make it easy to use. Note that filters require replacement every three months or so, at $25-$35 a pop. —Matthew Korfhage I go through a lot of heat protectants while testing hair straighteners for our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, and R+Co Bleu’s Hypersonic Heat Styling Mist is one of my go-tos. It protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (also great for hair dryers and curling irons) and goes on kind of thick, like hairspray, so it’s definitely effective at fighting frizz but also isn’t so heavy that it weighs hair down. It also comes in sustainable packaging and is Leaping Bunny certified to be cruelty-free. All of R+Co’s products are 30 percent off for Black Friday, so R+Co’s diatomaceous earth-based Skyline Dry Shampoo is also worth a grab if you need a TSA-compliant dry shampoo for travel or are trying to stay away from aerosols. On the subject of hair products, IGK is also offering 30 percent off everything on its site. While testing for an upcoming guide to the Best Heat Protectants we’ve also become quite fond of IGK’s Good Behavior Smoothing Spray (protects up to 450 degrees Fahrenheit), which is $10 off in the sale. —Kat Merck WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar used this toothbrush for years until he unfortunately left it behind in a hotel room. RIP, little toothbrush. This model has three cleaning modes, a pressure sensor, and a built-in timer that helps you brush thoroughly and efficiently. It comes with a travel case, a charger, and extra brush heads, and it’s kitted out in black, which may be more appealing than the dainty electric toothbrush designs that are popular of late. —Louryn Strampe Sonic toothbrushes are a little gentler than your standard oscillating toothbrush, and the Philips 4100 Sonicare is our favorite sonic toothbrush we’ve tried. We already like the 4100 for all the features it packs at its price point—two intensity levels, a pressure sensor, and a two-minute timer—and those features are an even better deal right now while this toothbrush is on sale. —Nena Farrell This was a past budget pick in our electric toothbrush guide, and it’s still a great, affordable toothbrush. It’s cute, thin, and has a gentle cleaning vibration as a sonic toothbrush. It comes with a carrying case, too. —Nena Farrell Our favorite cheap electric toothbrush is even cheaper for Black Friday. You can usually find it for around $20, but it’s just $15 right now. It does a great job cleaning, has a gentle sonic cleaning style, and even comes with seven (that’s right, seven!) replacement heads. That’s not even $2 for the toothbrush and each head. It comes in pink, too. The only downside is that the charger is inconvenient, but for how much you get for the low price, it’s worth it. —Nena Farrell Yes, the TheraFace Mask is one of the pricier LED masks on the market, so if there’s ever a time to indulge, it’s during a sale. What sets it apart from other LED masks is the added vibration therapy, which massages pressure points around the eyes, browline, and scalp. Using it feels less like skincare and more like a therapeutic retreat I can experience from the comfort of my bed. —Boutayna Chokrane Why choose between skincare tools when you can have them all? With six interchangeable heads, the FDA-cleared TheraFace Pro (7/10, WIRED Recommends) offers an impressive range of facial treatments: cleansing, microcurrent, percussive massage, and LED light therapy (blue, red, and infrared). You don’t need to spend $400 for clear skin, but with $100 off, it’s a tempting treat for any beauty enthusiasts looking to pamper themselves at home. —Boutayna Chokrane The Series 9 is Braun’s ”professional-grade” beard trimmer for the home set, with a quick and secure front control dial to change cut length, long battery life, and an excellent-quality main clipper attachment. Other attachments of equal quality allow tight detail work, or ruler-straight lines and edgework. It is, in short, our favorite overall beard trimmer—and it’s handsomely on sale. —Matthew Korfhage There are hair straighteners that are best for thick and curly hair and hair straighteners that are best for finer, more wavy hair, but it’s rare to find one that works great for both. As the top pick in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this ceramic iron makes short work of most hair textures—former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has one she’s been using on her curls since college, and this is the iron I use on my own unruly 3a curls for daily touch-ups. I also like the maneuverability of the smaller plates and the quick one-minute heating time. —Kat Merck If you love the idea of a multi-tool system like the Dyson AirWrap but can’t stomach shelling out $600, the Shark FlexStyle (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is for you. Like the AirWrap, there are two sets, one for “straight and wavy” and one for “curly and coily,” and both come with two brushes for drying and two barrels for curling. The wand bends at the middle to become a hair dryer that can be used alone or in concert with one of the brush attachments, and it even has one more heat setting than the Dyson—all for literally half the price. WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary declared it the Best Multitasking Curler, while former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano deemed it a “near-perfect dupe” of the AirWrap. —Kat Merck Some people (like me) have stubborn hair that will only straighten with a flat iron, but others with more forgiving hair have a wider breadth of options, from hot brushes to air-assisted tools like Dyson’s AirWrap (8/10 WIRED Recommends). Yet another method is via the Tymo Ring, a straightening comb that former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano called in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners a way to take “the curl right out quickly—I didn't have to go over sections more than once or twice.” She also liked the outer shell that covers the hot teeth, so users are able to get closer to their roots without burning themselves. —Kat Merck This is the best curling iron for long hair. It’s suitable for all hair types and has a tourmaline ceramic-coated barrel that’ll help your hair stay silky and frizz-free. The curling iron heats up quickly, and the long barrel means you have plenty of room to work so you won’t have to contort around trying to perfect your styling technique. This model also has dual voltage, so it’ll work on any international trips. —Louryn Strampe Deemed the best curling iron for long-lasting curls in our guide to the Best Curling Irons, WIRED contributor Alanna Martine Kilkeary loved the elongated barrel of this iron, as well as the metal clamp to hold a curl in place while it sets. GHD is a quality brand that also makes some of our favorite hair straighteners as well, like the Chronos and Platinum+. Kilkeary wasn’t a huge fan of the lack of temperature dial on this curling iron, but she still recommends it as a durable option that produces long-lasting results. —Kat Merck As detailed in our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, this OG Chi is an oldie but a goodie—even though it’s got ceramic plates and only heats up to 392 degrees Fahrenheit, it’s able to successfully smooth a broad range of hair types and textures. It’s lightweight, with 1-inch plates for easy maneuverability and waves, plus it’s got three heat settings and one-hour auto-shutoff for safety. I had one of these straighteners decades ago and it lasted nearly 10 years. Even though this isn’t the greatest sale I’ve ever seen, I still wouldn’t hesitate to buy it again. —Kat Merck This mascara has been my holy grail for years. There are a few drugstore dupes that come close, but in my opinion, nothing beats the real thing. It makes my lashes look long, thick, and velvety in just one coat, and in two coats I might as well be wearing falsies. I also appreciate just how deep and dark the black color is. If you want the most dramatic lashes of your life, this is the way. —Louryn Strampe The MakeUp Eraser is a thing of beauty. The soft microfiber cloth is one of our favorite reusable products. It lives up to its name—simply get it wet with warm water and rub it gently over your face. It’ll demolish your makeup while being kinder to your skin than disposable makeup wipes. I’ve successfully used it to remove smoky eye looks, red liquid lipstick, and heavy contour—all in one fell swoop. You’ll still want to cleanse with a traditional cleanser or some micellar water, especially to remove traces from harder-to-reach areas like your inner corner or lashline, but this is an excellent and economical way to wash your face. The cloth is machine-washable and dries pretty quickly as well. —Louryn Strampe If you’re looking for an alternative to a blow-dryer brush, the GHD Duet Style is a blow-dryer and flat iron combo that former WIRED contributor Victoria Woollaston-Webber thought worked just as well as the Dyson Airstrait (8/10, WIRED Recommends). Hot air vents through the device’s plates dry hair as it straightens for less damage overall, according to GHD. In our guide to the Best Hair Straighteners, Victoria said she especially liked that the Shine Shot Mode could turn off the air and convert it to a traditional hair straightener. —Kat Merck The Pattern Blow Dryer will be featured in an upcoming guide to hair diffusers. It’s got three heat settings and two air speeds, and it comes with four attachments. I loved using this hair dryer. It’s great for damaged hair since it doesn’t get as hot as other dryers, and the attachments can be attached vertically or horizontally for added control. The diffuser has great ventilation and dries my curls efficiently while also giving them more oomph. The dryer isn’t too heavy either, so if you’re biceps-challenged like I am, you’ll still be able to get good use out of it. —Louryn Strampe Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite Android phone is back at its lowest price! The Pixel 8A is everything anyone needs in a smartphone (8/10, WIRED Recommends), from excellent cameras and slick performance to smart software features and a bright display. It has all the accouterments, including wireless charging, an IP67 water resistance rating, and seven years of software support, which is unparalleled in a smartphone that costs this much. Read our Best Pixel Phones guide to see all the fun little software tricks to take advantage of. —Julian Chokkattu This is the first major discount on Google’s brand-new Pixel smartphones, launched in late August (9/10, WIRED Recommends). They’re some of the smartest smartphones, with plenty of new features powered by Google’s Gemini large language models. For example, you can get instant transcriptions and summaries from voice recordings or phone calls. The XL version has the same features with a bigger display (and a bigger battery too). It costs $849 ($250 off). —Julian Chokkattu OnePlus will likely unveil a successor very soon in the new year, but the OnePlus 12R is an excellent midrange Android phone that’s speedy in every way (it can fully recharge in 30 minutes with the included charger and cable!). It has an AMOLED 120-Hz screen, a 5,500-mAh battery that lasted me two days, and the 2023 flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset can handle the most demanding games. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve tracked. You should also consider the flagship OnePlus 12 while you’re here, because it’s also on sale for $550 ($100 off). It has better performance and wireless charging support. —Julian Chokkattu There are some quirks, but the Pixel 9 Pro Fold (6/10, WIRED Recommends) is the booklike folding phone I’d buy if I were in the market, and this is a tantalizing price. It’s very slim and using the external display feels like a normal phone, with nearly the same dimensions as the Pixel 9 Pro. But, of course, you can open the Fold up to reveal a much larger 8-inch internal screen, perfect for catching up on shows on the commute home. —Julian Chokkattu OK, brace yourselves, because the Galaxy S24 lineup now has four phones: Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and the new Galaxy S24 FE (8/10, WIRED Recommends). The latter is the cheapest, taking some of the highlights from the flagship lineup and putting it in a more affordable body, lowering the price. At $475, it’s a great smartphone with long software support (seven years), even if it’s a bit drab. The S24 and S24+ won’t feel dramatically different, offering boosted specs here and there, but it’s the S24 Ultra for $950 ($350 off) you should consider if you’re after Samsung’s best. This one has the S Pen stylus built in, not to mention the 5X optical zoom, and the titanium build. Just know that Samsung is expected to debut a successor in January, so wait if you want the latest and greatest. This deal is also at Samsung and Best Buy. —Julian Chokkattu Flip phones are all the rage. These folding phones work like normal smartphones, but you can fold them in half to stow them in a pocket or purse. What’s not to love? Well, battery life isn’t great (you can just barely eke out a day with average use), but they’re cute and fun, plus Samsung’s build quality is exceptional (7/10, WIRED Recommends). The Galaxy Z Flip6’s external screen isn’t as useful as the cover screen on Motorola’s Razr+, but this is still a well-built flip phone at a reasonable price. —Julian Chokkattu This 10-foot cable is long enough to allow you to place your phone where you want while charging (or continue using it without having to crouch near the outlet). It’s a durable braided nylon cable from Anker that comes with a lifetime warranty. It can deliver up to 100 watts to fast-charge any phone or tablet and comes with a handy cable tie. You can get it in black or white, but I like the red because it stands out, making it less of a tripping hazard. This is the best long cable in our best USB-C cables guide. —Simon Hill This might just be the most incredible value of 2024. The Moto G Power 5G already impressed me (8/10, WIRED Recommends) earlier this year with its solid performance and 120-Hz LCD screen, not to mention the support for NFC to make contactless payments and even wireless charging. At this $200 discount, it’s a shockingly good Android phone, though its biggest flaw is that it will only receive an update to Android 15, and that’s it. You’ll still get two more years of security updates though. —Julian Chokkattu Want a booklike folding phone? My top pick is the Google Pixel 9 Pro, but Samsung’s new Galaxy Z Fold6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is even cheaper! It has excellent build quality (Samsung has been doing this for six years after all), and the external display is wider than before, making it nicer to use. The cameras are great and the screens are bright, though it doesn’t open up to as large a screen as the Pixel. —Julian Chokkattu OtterBox is usually my “Most Protective” recommendation in our many smartphone case guides. But the company makes all sorts of cases, even ones that are colorful, stylish, and slim. If you’re in the market for a new case, the company is offering 30 percent off sitewide on Amazon as well as its website. If you need a place to start, here are a few picks: Own a Pixel 9 series phone? I like the Commuter Series for $25 ($15 off). iPhone 16 owners should check out the protective OtterBox Defender Series Pro XT for $49 ($21 off). Anyone with the Samsung Galaxy S24 series should try the Commuter Series for $28 ($12 off). —Julian Chokkattu This is one of our favorite wireless chargers but it is expensive, so this sale might be the perfect time to grab one. We recommend springing for the Qi2 version, as it will be compatible with the wave of Qi2 Android phones coming in 2025, but it also works with MagSafe iPhones (iPhone 13 models and newer support the Qi2 protocol). If you're just an iPhone person, the standard MagSafe version of this charger is also on sale for $77 ($33 off). Check out our Nomad Black Friday sale post for more deals. —Simon Hill Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals The Series 10 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is the latest model to join Apple's lineup. It also holds the top spot in our guide to the Best Apple Watches. Compared to its predecessor, it not only has a bigger display, but it's also thinner, lighter, and packs support for fast charging. The smartwatch also runs WatchOS 11, so you'll have access to features like Vitals (to check your baseline every morning) and Training Load (to see how your workouts are impacting your fitness over time). It's worth noting that it doesn't pack a blood oxygen sensor, though. —Brenda Stolyar The Ultra 2 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is our top pick for outdoor sports. Under the hood is an S9 chip for faster performance and an ultra-wideband chip with enhanced precision finding. You'll also have access to dual-frequency GPS, offline maps (that you'll have to download to your iPhone), and Backtrack for creating virtual breadcrumb trails on the Compass app via the Action button. —Brenda Stolyar Yes, the price is lower now that the new Oura Ring 4 has been released. But I wore the Oura Ring Gen3 for many years and found it to be accurate, attractive, and comfortable (once all the features it had promised in 2021 became available). Some days, I even find myself missing the three little bump optical sensors on the back of my ring. This is a pretty remarkable deal for a one-of-a-kind fitness tracker that started a whole product category all by itself. —Adrienne So The best running watch will probably always be a Garmin Forerunner. The line ranges from the barebones Forerunner 55 to the spendy Forerunner 965 for triathlons, but I think the Forerunner 165 has pretty much everything you need. The more you spend, the more sensors you get, and the Forerunner 165 has blood oxygen sensing plus a barometric altimeter, compass, and ambient light sensor, in addition to the now-standard fall detection and multiple satellite positioning systems. —Adrienne So The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill Samsung tried to make a squircle-shaped Apple Watch Ultra competitor and it’s … OK (7/10, WIRED Review). The company also targeted Apple-like pricing, but the Galaxy Watch Ultra didn’t have complete feature parity and its software isn’t as polished. Still, this is a powerful smartwatch with a few extra features over the company’s standard Galaxy Watch7, and it’s much more reasonably priced with this discount, which ends on December 1. —Julian Chokkattu The newest Pixel Watch 3 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) comes in two sizes, and I very much recommend you snag the larger 45-mm variant. It doesn’t look that big on small wrists, but you get much better battery life (just a smidge over a full 24 hours). Google’s health and fitness tracking capabilities are excellent, and there’s even a unique Loss of Pulse feature on the way in the US (it’s available in select countries), which could help contact emergency services in the event of cardiac arrest. —Julian Chokkattu The OnePlus Watch 2 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) had one job: stand out from other Wear OS smartwatches, and it succeeded. Unlike Samsung’s Galaxy Watch7 or Google’s Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus prioritized battery life over all else, and thanks to a clever dual-processor and dual-operating system hybrid architecture, the Watch 2 can last roughly three days on a single charge. Hooray! The health tracking isn’t its strong suit, but this is a Wear OS smartwatch so you’ll find many rich smart features, though it’s only compatible with Android phones. You can save even more by going with the OnePlus Watch 2R for $170 ($60 off), which has a screen that doesn’t get as bright, no sapphire crystal coating over the glass, and an aluminum build over stainless steel. —Julian Chokkattu The Fitbit Charge 6 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) tops our guide to the best fitness trackers thanks to the perfect balance of attractiveness, affordability, accessibility, and ease of use. Google’s takeover has led to several smart integrations with Google Maps, Google Wallet, and YouTube Music Premium. This tracker can keep tabs on your skin temperature, 24/7 heart rate, activities, and sleep schedule. You can also expect week-long battery life, but the best features still require the $10/month Fitbit Premium subscription. —Simon Hill This is still the watch that I would wear if I didn’t have to test other fitness trackers—and I’m not the only one, because Garmin’s Instinct line is one of the company’s most popular. It has all the backcountry capabilities of the higher-end Fenix and Epix lines, but it’s more affordable because it ditches the fancy screen. The Instinct 2 Solar’s battery life lasted almost three weeks when I tested it in Hawaii, where I used it to keep track of everything from trail runs to keeping me oriented toward the beach when snorkeling. —Adrienne So Garmin recently combined its two high-end Epix and Fenix lines in the updated Fenix 8 series, which we will be including in our Best Fitness Trackers roundup. However, if you have no particular need for voice commands or new, leakproof buttons for scuba, the second-gen Epix Pro is still a great buy, and it’s now much cheaper! Use the beautiful AMOLED screen to access Garmin’s detailed proprietary maps. And I’m a little embarrassed by how much I like the onboard flashlight. —Adrienne So The latest iteration of Samsung’s Galaxy Watch series has some artificial intelligence algorithms to improve your health tracking data, like giving you a comprehensive Energy Score and updated sleep tracking abilities. It can also detect if you have sleep apnea. However, editor Julian Chokkattu found battery life frustrating compared to older models, and it’s worth noting you won’t get the full functionality unless you pair it with a Samsung phone. —Adrienne So The Withings’ line is consistently our top analog pick for both Best Smartwatches and Best Fitness Trackers. My colleague Simon Hill tested it and found that it’s comfortable, looks great, and has a long battery life and a comprehensive suite of health features that track heart rate and monitor your ECG. Two minor dings—Simon was unimpressed by the optional new subscription, and I found that the cycle tracking feature that comes with temperature tracking was not able to predict my period, but then again, no wrist-based wearable really can (so far). —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This easy-to-build home arcade cabinet features a 17-inch color LCD screen, a light-up marquee, authentic arcade controls, and runs 14 Namco games, including every version of Pac-Man and a few extras like Galaga and Dig Dug. Whether you grew up in the arcades or not, these games still have a powerful addictive hook, and this Pac-Man arcade machine brought me closer to my teen kids. This is a decent discount that drops it to the lowest price we’ve seen. —Simon Hill This isn't technically a Black Friday deal, but Meta is currently offering Batman: Arkham Shadow and three months of Meta Quest+, its game subscription program, through April 2025. If you've never tried a VR headset and you're curious, this is one of the best and easiest ways to start playing loads of games to see if you like it. We also think the Quest 3S is one of the cheapest and lightest ways to get into gaming (it will still make you slightly nauseous if you're not used to it, though.) —Adrienne So This is our top gaming headset recommendation because it uses Logitech’s Lightspeed connection system (with a 2.4-GHz dongle) for low-latency audio (important when playing fast-paced games). You can also use Bluetooth if you’d like, or jack in with the 3.5-mm headphone jack. That makes it more versatile than ever. The boom mic arm is detachable so you can wear this out of the house without feeling like you’re headed to a call center. Our previous top pick was the G Pro X 2’s predecessor, and it’s also on sale for $81 ($19 off). But that one’s a wired headset so you have fewer connectivity options. —Julian Chokkattu The PlayStation 5 Slim is a slimmed-down version of the PlayStation 5 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) that’s around 30 percent slimmer. It runs the same list of great PS5 games but takes up less space beneath the TV. We have a breakdown of the different PlayStation 5 models if you want to dive deeper, but the PS5 Slim is the only one on sale for Black Friday and a 15 percent discount is decent if you’re in the market for a Sony console. —Simon Hill If you’re hunting for an upgraded gaming headset with all the bells and whistles, the Arctis Nova Pro is our favorite pick for serious gamers. It includes a desktop DAC with convenient volume controls, real-time information, and EQ settings. Plus, it’s super comfortable for gaming long hours, with soft ear cups and an extra stretchy headband support that reduces strain on the top of your head. The wired version is on discount, but there’s a Wireless version as well (8/10, WIRED Recommends) if that’s more your speed. —Brad Bourque Compact gaming keyboards like the Razer Huntsman Mini make a lot of sense for gamers with limited desk space. As long as you can live without a num pad or arrow keys, you’ll find all the features you’d expect from a full size offering in this compact keyboard. That includes Razer’s excellent software support, keycap compatibility, and excellent build quality. All that adds up to a big deal on a small board, and it’s just part of the reason the Razer Huntsman Mini is our favorite small keyboard. —Brad Bourque With a million mechanical keyboards on the market, it can be tough to stand out, but the Corsair K100 does just that with its built-in control wheel. This programmable knob can adjust keyboard lighting or other built-in keyboard functions, but more fun is the option to set it to control media playback on your system. You’ll also get RGB backlighting, a volume control wheel, and a set of macro keys along the left side, all features we’d expect from a mechanical keyboard at this price point. —Brad Bourque The Steam Deck might be all about portable handheld gaming, but sometimes you just wanna plug it into a bigger screen, just like a Nintendo Switch, especially if you want to play a game with a keyboard and mouse. This aluminum Jsaux 7-in-1 Steam Deck Dock will do the job, with three USB-A ports, a DisplayPort, an HDMI, a USB-C, and even an Ethernet port. —Julian Chokkattu I didn’t think I’d love Disney Dreamlight Valley when I first installed it, but it quickly became one of my favorite cozy games. It’s fantastic on the Nintendo Switch but available for other consoles. It’s a life sim where you’ll run around collecting items, farming crops, fishing, and decorating, but it also has a surprisingly grown-up storyline that might entice even those of us who don’t have fond memories of Disney movies or shows. The Cozy Edition comes with bonus cosmetics that you don’t get with the base game. Pro tip: Plant all the pumpkins. —Louryn Strampe It’s always nice to see a solid deal on our favorite keyboard. The Logitech G Pro X TKL Lightspeed might have a mouthful of a name, but it’s as streamlined and stylish as they come. It sports bright backlit keys with your standard RGB setup, wireless connectivity, and a minimal, high quality design that fits right in on any desk. Beyond media controls and some buttons for functionality, the G Pro X TKL packs just the right features, and leaves the rest on the cutting room floor, which is why we like it. —Brad Bourque If you’re looking for a simple joystick for gaming, it’s hard to beat the value on the Logitech G Extreme 3D Pro USB Joystick. It isn’t the fanciest, and its plastic construction won’t impress true enthusiasts, but you’ll spend two or three times the price to get anything similar from a manufacturer as reputable as Logitech. It also sports a huge number of buttons, both on the handle and on the base, and a throttle slider that’s not as common on joysticks at this price point. That makes it the perfect joystick for a quick flight in Microsoft Flight Simulator or a few hours of space trucking in Elite Dangerous. —Brad Bourque Looking for a totally souped-up set of flight controls? The Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flight is a complete system for feeling like you’re actually at the controls of your favorite planes. The 180-degree yoke feels more true to life than a simple joystick, and the hall effect sensor means it should have a nice long lifespan. It also packs in bells and whistles like a screen on the yoke, and dedicated controls for throttle and propellers, making this an excellent upgrade option for anyone who loves to play Microsoft Flight Simulator. —Brad Bourque The hardest console gamers know that quick reactions can be the difference between total glory and complete failure, so give yourself every advantage with the SCUFInstinct Pro controller for Xbox. This upgraded controller features improved materials for grip and comfort, plus a more premium build quality, but the best part is hidden around back. Four programmable paddles allow you to put your most important buttons right at your fingertips for lightning-fast access, giving you the ultimate edge against anyone who has to move their hand to hit the melee button. —Brad Bourque Our favorite USB microphone is sporting a decent discount for Black Friday, as it is fairly often. The Blue Yeti has a long history on the desks of streamers and podcasters, and for good reason. It sports solid audio performance, great build quality, and easy access to controls. That makes it a great option for anyone looking to upgrade from their gaming headset’s microphone, or to pair with some better headphones. —Brad Bourque This Intel Core i7-14700K 8-Core 5.6 GHz (LGA 1700 Socket) chip is a very solid performer and will work with any 700-series chipset-based motherboard. It'll get you through heavy workday tasks like video editing with ease and can handle 4K gaming. —Scott Gilbertson This is one of the best game controllers for PC gamers, with five central buttons on the front, a pair of rear paddles, and plenty of customization options. 8BitDo’s software lets you remap buttons, tweak the stick and trigger sensitivity, assign macros, and tune the vibration intensity. It’s compact with a grippy texture on the handles, satisfyingly clicky triggers, and a decent D-pad. There’s a 2.4G dongle in the handy charging dock for PC gaming, and battery life is around 20 hours. It also has Bluetooth support for Nintendo Switch players, making this a solid alternative to the Switch Pro controller. —Simon Hill This year's i7 or last year's i9? If you're building your own PC, this is a great deal. Intel's high-end gaming option, the 13th-gen Core i9, was an incredibly versatile performer and still stacks up will in benchmark tests against newer, lower end chips like the 14th-gen i7. At this price, we say go for it. —Scott Gilbertson Western Digital also makes excellent SSDs, and this one is no exception. The SN 770 M.2 2280 achieved speeds of 5,100 Mbps in my testing, which is blazing fast. If you're doing a lot of drive-intensive tasks, like editing video or gaming, this drive is well worth the money. The largest version you can get is 2 TB, but the price is reasonable considering the speed increase. —Scott Gilbertson Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals This LifeStraw has been featured in many an iteration of our outdoorsy gift guide (though we’ve replaced it this year). Nevertheless, it’s a good product. This LifeStraw can screw onto a plastic water bottle or be used as a straw to slurp up water from basically anywhere. It filters out at least 99.99 percent of bacteria, microplastics, and other gross contaminants. If you’re shopping for a prepper this holiday season, or you’re just like me and ill-prepared for the zombie apocalypse, this deal is worth checking out. —Louryn Strampe WIRED reviewer Adrienne So reviewed the 2-watt version of these bulletproof walkie-talkies (8/10, WIRED Review) and I’ve started testing this version, which has more than twice the power and promises a half-mile of carry in even the least advantageous of environments (and up to 35 miles when circumstances are right). They’ve got USB-C charging and IP56 water resistance and the signal has been clear and strong in my testing. This is the first time the 5-watt version of the Rocky Talkie radio has ever been on sale. —Martin Cizmar The Leatherman Wave+ is our top pick multi-tool. The tools flip out and retract with just the right mix of smoothness and tension, and the mix of tools here is very useful—two stainless steel knives, one with a straight edge and the other serrated, along with 16 other tools, including a wood-and-metal file, a diamond-coated file, a saw, Phillips screwdriver bits, scissors, an 8-inch ruler, and a wire stripper, as well as a bottle and can opener. I love my pellet smoker for cooking everything from meat to pizza—as does WIRED reviewer Scott Gilbertson in our guide to the Best Grills—which is why I highly recommend this Traeger this Black Friday. It can connect to Wi-Fi for easy monitoring of longer cooks, and features the classic easy-to-clean Traeger design that made the brand an icon in the first place. —Parker Hall The Breeo is the most overbuilt option on our best fire pits guide and wins our favor by opening the door to a complete ecosystem of products including a live-fire pizza oven and a flat-top grill for making smashburgers. This is a sizable sale on the pit. —Martin Cizmar This Coleman folding/rolling grill has a couple nice features, like dual burners for different heat zones on the same grill. But it also had a nasty habit of pinching my fingers whenever I wasn't careful when collapsing it. So long as you're careful, this one will do everything the more expensive Weber Traveler we recommend does and allow for dual temperature cooking. —Louryn Strampe Almost everything at Ooni is 20 percent off for Black Friday. While the Solo Stove may be the top pick in our Best Pizza Ovens roundup (temporarily! We don’t know for sure yet), we’ve tried and recommend pretty much everything from Ooni, which basically invented the category when the company launched in 2012. The Volt is its electric oven, which is the best pick if you’re staying inside right now. The specs are better than its closest competitor, the Breville Pizzaiolo, and I’ve made everything from cookies to roasted broccoli in mine. —Adrienne So Like the Coleman above, the RoadTrip 225 allows you to use only one burner, so you can grill a couple of burgers without draining your propane tank. With variable controls, you can sear veggies on one side while cooking meat more slowly on the other. There's a grease pan to catch drips while cooking, and it's removable for cleaning. You also get push-button ignition and 11,000 BTUs of propane grilling power. At this price, it's hard to beat these features. —Louryn Strampe Not only is the Theragun Sense the quietest of all Theraguns, but it also packs the same premium features as the higher-end models. The built-in LCD screen and guided breathwork routines deliver the same luxe factor as the Pro Plus model for $400 less. The four included attachments (standard ball, dampener, thumb, and micro-point) cover all the muscle groups. —Boutayna Chokrane Don’t let the size of the Theragun Mini 2 fool you—though she be but little, she is fierce! With three attachments (standard ball, dampener, and thumb) and 150-minute battery life, the Mini 2 is the best for targeting sore spots on the go. It’s not the best for the harder-to-reach areas, but it excels in portability. I’ve been carrying it in my gym bag for months and hardly notice its presence. It even includes a zip-up case; one less pochette to buy. —Boutayna Chokrane You can buy standard foam rollers for way less, but the Therabody Wave Roller justifies its price with its tech-enhanced features. With five vibration frequencies, it allows you to target specific muscle groups with varying intensities. The added benefit of Bluetooth connectivity lets you pair it with the Therabody app for even more customized options. —Boutayna Chokrane The PowerDot 2.0 Muscle Stimulator is a recent addition to my recovery routine. It pairs with your smartphone to provide personalized muscle recovery and strength training, and ease menstrual cramps. When I first tried it, I expected a sharp zap, but the sensation was surprisingly soothing, like a prickly, customizable massage. The Duo is ideal for multiple or larger areas, and it comes with everything you need: electrode pads, lead cables, a charger, and a carrying case. Note: I’ve encountered some connectivity hiccups with the app, and online reviews suggest I’m not alone. Still, when it works, it’s brilliant. —Boutayna Chokrane The LifePro Sonic Massage Gun proves you don’t need to spend a fortune for a deep-tissue massage. With eight included attachments—yes, eight—it’s the most versatile massager we’ve tried. It’s more than capable of working even the most stubborn knots, and with five intensity levels, don’t worry about whether it packs a punch. —Boutayna Chokrane Niu’s scooters have long been reliable for me, with simple folding mechanisms and a comfy riding experience. That continues with the KQi 300X, a 49-pound escooter with 10.5-inch tubeless tires, regenerative braking, and a 16-mile range in my tests (I’m 6’4”, so you can probably go even further.) This one has turn signals too, though they are not time-based and need to be turned off manually. Still, this is one of the lower prices I’ve seen and great value. —Julian Chokkattu The Branwyn bra is in our essential guide to merino wool, but I like it enough that I wrote a whole separate rave about it. Merino wool is a miracle fiber—it’s renewable, odor-resistant, regulates your temperature, and doesn’t leave you with a terminal case of swamp booty should you choose to jump in a river with your hiking clothes on. What’s not to like? Everything at Branwyn is 25 percent off through Cyber Monday. —Adrienne So I’ve been testing this down puffer instead of my usual Patagonia puffer so far this winter and have been duly impressed by the perfect trim cuts of the recycled shell fabric, smooth zippers, and how light it is (less than a pound for my XL). —Martin Cizmar WIRED contributor Kristin Canning said that this was the best bug spray, so imagine my triumph when I looked it up on Amazon and saw that this is the bug spray I’ve already bought! I agree with Kristin’s assessment that the spray feels lightweight and the smell isn’t off-putting. This is a good time to stock up if you’re already planning your sunny holiday vacation. —Adrienne So I’ve now tested more than 50 pickleball paddles to make our guide to the best, but I have a soft spot for the SLK Evo, which was the first nice paddle I bought with my own money. It has a nice neutral feel and a great grip. You won’t be able to get much top spin off the fiberglass face, but it’s fine for anyone below the advanced level. —Martin Cizmar This inflatable hot tub is nice! The Coleman SaluSpa Ibiza (7/10, WIRED Review) is easy to set up and generally user-friendly. It takes a while to heat up, but when it’s rolling, it’s a great place to relax and unwind. The pump module has built-in cupholders and there are optional air jets to bubble away all of your worries. It’s got room for four to six people, though I think six would be a bit too cozy. Just make sure you have the space for it before purchasing. —Louryn Strampe Movement begets more movement! WIRED contributor Kristin Canning would have paid even full price for this walking pad. It feels good underfoot (she often walks on it wearing just socks), isn’t annoyingly loud, and doesn’t shake her standing desk. You can control it with both the remote or the app, and Canning prefers the app as the Bluetooth connectivity can get a bit wonky. —Adrienne So No one I know has ever regretted getting a walking pad. It helps even the least motivated of us get a little more movement into our day. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano noted that the Egofit is compact and easy to use and move. You can control it with a remote, and the digital screen displays time, calories burned, distance walked, steps, and walking speed (be warned, though, there is no pause button). —Adrienne So In our Smart Bird Feeders Buying Guide, we recommend this model as the prettiest, and we also like that it’s made with less plastic than other feeders. This bamboo Netvue Birdfy (6/10, WIRED Review) features an extendable perch and two large bins for bird seeds, and it includes a solar panel so you won’t need to charge or replace the batteries. The included 1080p camera will show you video feeds and pictures of bird visitors. You can pay more to get a lifetime subscription with AI that’ll help identify birds—though sometimes it gets it wrong. Note that, although it’s rot- and mold-resistant, it does need to be sealed with a bird-safe wood sealer. —Louryn Strampe If you’re tired of getting on a ladder to put up your Christmas lights each year, try Govee’s Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro instead. They’re a set of permanent lights, designed to stay up all year and for years to come. These smart lights can handle a nice range of temperatures (from -4 to 140 degrees Fahrenheit) and are weatherproof with an IP67 rating for the lights and an IP65 rating for the control box. WIRED reviewer Simon Hill says the adhesive works well to attach them to your home, and that installation for these permanent lights was easy overall. You can easily customize the lights for the holidays and months beyond using the Govee app to create almost any kind of color design or find any lighting effect you could hope for. —Nena Farrell In our Best Treadmills roundup, WIRED contributor Kristin Canning notes that the incline ranges on the BowFlex Treadmill 22 are much greater than our top pick, the NordicTrack. That means it’s ideal for hill training, or if it’s dark and late outside and you can’t make yourself drive anywhere to prep for an upcoming road race. Bowflex has its own proprietary fitness programming with both on- and off-tread options, but you can also stream your own shows and movies, too. —Adrienne So Even if we weren’t always scaling rugged peaks, we used Rocky Talkies on almost every camping trip—you need a better way to talk to your family besides running around and yelling. Rocky Talkies have a few advantages over cheap walkies. They come with a carabiner to clip on your pack or clothes, so they don’t slide off; the battery life is much better, and it’s much easier to use. The push-to-talk button is even recessed so you don’t accidentally transmit your shit-talking. The waterproof mic and extra battery are also on sale. —Adrienne So Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals If you’re in the market for a travel bag, the Dagne Dover Petra Convertible Tote is a chameleon of carryalls. It’s part backpack, part tote, and even has a luggage pass-through that is a back-saver during long treks through airports. At nearly 17 inches tall, this bag is big, but it still fits under most airplane seats. We’re particularly fond of the padded compartments, offering extra protection for your tech gear and one less thing to worry about while rushing to your gate. —Boutayna Chokrane WIRED reviewer Martin Cizmar raved about this travel backpack to an almost annoying extent. Not only can it max out your allotted carry-on space, it’s a real trail-ready backpack that’s comfortable enough to wear for 10 to 20 miles of hiking. The straps are fully adjustable, the pockets are well-considered, and there’s everything from webbing to a padded hip belt. It also comes in a very bright and attractive yellow. —Adrienne So No, a basic Travelpro soft-sided carry-on isn’t going to be the flashiest personal accompaniment when you’re going through the airport. But there’s a reason this is the brand most flight attendants have—you get a tremendous amount of bang for your buck. Our tester found that the handle was sturdy, the wheels rolled smoothly, and it weighs a mere 5.4 pounds. This is one of the best bags that you can get for around $100. —Adrienne So San Francisco-based Aer is known for its travel bags’ durability and minimalist designs, and the Aer Travel Pack 3 combines both of these with an unreal amount of organization. Our favorite work travel pack in our guide to the Best Carry-on Luggage, this bag can be carried as a backpack or a briefcase. It has a tech-organizing pocket in front of a larger compartment that zips flat to accommodate folded clothes or packing cubes, and it fits neatly under the seat on most airlines’ planes. The only down side is a weirdly small water bottle holder that won’t fit most larger water bottles (precisely the kind you’d want to bring for long trips). —Kat Merck An honorable mention in our guide to the Best Toiletry Bags, this toiletry kit is a decent option for those who want a simple, well-made bag that can either hang or lay flat. There’s a snap-in plastic envelope for soap or a toothbrush, and the navy version I tested is made from recycled bottles. I wasn’t especially impressed with the bag’s organizational components in comparison to its size, and I didn’t like that the bag’s thick, small plastic hook couldn’t hang on a towel rack, but otherwise, I had no major complaints during my weeks of testing. It should also be noted this bag comes in almost 20 different colors and prints, from metallic pink to a basketball motif, so at this price it would make a great gift for adults and kids alike. —Kat Merck Are you traveling with kids this holiday season? Then I highly suggest you avoid the pain of the checked luggage line and get your kids their own carry-ons. I would’ve saved myself from a graveyard of dead luggage if I’d just bought them State bags from the start instead of trying to save some money. In addition to being as sturdy and lighter than my own carry-on, the State bags have kid-friendly features, like fun prints and an organizational front pocket. Everything at State is 30 percent off with the code BF24. —Adrienne So If you want to fly with only an underseat item, the wheels on this teeny, tiny carry-on pop off so you can simply slide it under your seat (although I flew with it on Alaska Airlines and it fit without me taking the wheels off). The wheels are easy to pop off and tuck into the seat pocket. However, they are loud and rattle when you’re walking, especially over rough surfaces like sidewalks. If this doesn’t make you grit your teeth, this tiny suitcase is impressively functional for the price. —Adrienne So The Beis Carry On is viral for a reason. It's not only a beautiful bag, coming in an eye-catching array of colors (I’ve got the bag in the light-blue slate, but the warm brown maple color is always calling my name), but also comes with a bunch of great features. A built-in weight! A bag lock! Two organizer bags that match the color of your bag! A soft cushion for your hand on the handle! If I could take this bag everywhere, I would. It's 30 percent off right now, and Beis doesn't often have sales, so there’s no better time to upgrade your carry-on luggage. —Nena Farrell Our favorite toiletry bag for women is the Beis Dopp Kit. It has a handful of handy compartments, and WIRED reviewer Boutayna Chokrane says the water-resistant section is a total game changer when packing liquids or fragrances. It's nice and sturdy, with a wire top that will stay open for you to look through without losing its shape. It's on the large size compared to other Dopp kits, but that means you can truly store everything you need in this kit. If you need even more space, Beis' Cosmetic Case, another Gear team favorite, is 30 percent off. —Nena Farrell Staying hydrated feels almost effortless with the Owala 40-ounce tumbler. We love Owalas for a few reasons: They’re free of BPA, lead, and phthalates, which should be a minimum standard for reusable water bottles. Owala’s trademark 2-in-1 lid makes this tumbler work with hot, cold, and carbonated beverages. And Owala’s limited-edition color palettes are dangerously addictive, making it hard not to grab one in every shade. So, if you’re eyeing a certain design, there’s no time like the present. —Boutayna Chokrane Some travel mugs dent if you so much as look at them wrong, but not the Hydro Flask. Its signature powder-coated exterior is as durable as it is sleek. Former WIRED reviewer Medea Giordano has been using hers for years without a single ding, making it a reliable choice for your busiest days and clumsiest moments. Plus, no lead here—unlike certain other tumblers we know (looking at you, Stanley). —Boutayna Chokrane Pulling double duty as a duffel bag and a computer bag, this stylish black Cordura carry-on has a laptop compartment that fits two computers and a spacious main compartment for clothes or gear. An included clip-on strap allows it to be worn as a crossbody, and I like that it can be stuffed under the seat on most airlines. The dual water bottle holders are weirdly baggy and could use improvement, but otherwise, as a working parent I love this bag as a carry-on for longer flights with my family, as it not only fits my work gear but all my kid’s flight necessities as well, from headphones and snacks to sweatshirts and books. Put in the code at checkout to see the discounted price. —Kat Merck Editor Kat Merck is obsessed with the Dagne Dover Mila Toiletry Organizer, which she uses for her cosmetics. Made from recycled materials, it’s sustainable, water-resistant, and easy to clean. Merck especially loves the thoughtful compartments: the carabiner for jewelry, the zippered pouch for hair ties and bobby pins, and the elastic loops for makeup brushes. The sections can feel snug for more than two full-sized products but are perfect for travel-sized essentials. P.S., the small model is also on sale for $38. —Boutayna Chokrane Jump to a Topic: Best TV Deals, Apple Device Deals, Toy and Game Deals, Best Charging Deals, Best Kitchen Deals, Best Home Deals, Best Home Office Deals, Best Laptop and Tablet Deals, Best Soundbar Deals, Best Headphone Deals, Best Speaker Deals, Best Coffee Deals, Best Amazon Device Deals, Best Beauty Deals, Best Mobile Phone Deals, Best Smartwatch Deals, Best Gaming Deals, Best Outdoor Deals, Best Travel Deals, Best Camera Deals Our favorite mirrorless camera, Sony's A7 IV (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera capable of incredibly sharp images, with excellent dynamic range and great autofocus, and it's smaller than most of its competitors. There's five-axis image stabilization built-in, and it can shoot 7K oversampled 4K/30 fps video. —Scott Gilbertson The A7R V is the highest-resolution stills camera on the market (unless you opt for medium-format cameras). If that's not enough, there's a 16-shot, high-resolution mode that can create 240-MP images (so long as your subject is static, e.g., a landscape). The dynamic range is outstanding, and the autofocus speeds and smarts are some of the best we've seen. The only down side is the file size; fully uncompressed RAW files from this sensor run around 125 megabytes per image, though there are compressed options that will get them down to about 80 MP per image. —Scott Gilbertson Wanna be a YouTube star? This is the camera you need. The 18- to 50-mm (f/1.8 to f/4) equivalent zoom lens is plenty sharp and wide, and the Multi-Face Recognition mode is extremely clever and effective. In this mode, the ZV-1 II will detect when another face comes into the scene and automatically stops down the aperture to keep everyone in focus. There are limits, but it works surprisingly well. —Scott Gilbertson GoPro's new Hero 13 (7/10, WIRED Recommends) is a fantastic action camera. The Hero 13 features a new interchangeable lens system, with Macro, Ultra Wide, and Anamorphic lenses, plus a set of four neutral density filters (all sold separately). The Hero 13 Black even autodetects which lens is attached and changes settings accordingly. It's a slick, if expensive, system, but this deal at least saves you some cash on the base camera, which you can put toward an extra lens. Except the Anamorphic, which won't be available until 2025. —Scott Gilbertson This deal has been running since the new Hero 13 Black launched earlier this year, and if you have the extra $40 to spare, I highly recommend the Hero 13 over the 12. But if you're on a tight budget, or just don't have any interest in the interchangeable lenses, the Hero 12 uses the same sensor and makes a great action cam. —Scott Gilbertson The DJI Air 3 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) remains one of our favorite drones, despite the brand new Air 3S. The new Air 3S brings larger sensors, which do improve the video a bit, but the Air 3 is still a fantastic dual-camera drone and, at this price, a better value than the new Air 3S. —Scott Gilbertson The Osmo Action 4 has been surpassed by the new Osmo Action 5, but the Action 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) is still a fantastic action camera, especially at this price. The magnetic mounting system is great, the menu system makes switching between modes a snap, and the resulting photos and video are excellent. —Scott Gilbertson Insta360's Ace Pro was just replaced by the new Ace Pro 2, but this is a good deal on what is still a great camera. Capable of recording up to 8K 24 fps, with solid stabilization, good color handling, and a Leica lens to boot, there's a lot to love here, especially for only $300. That said, unless you think you're going to use the 8K (which is really only usable in still shots, not action footage), the Osmo Action 4 deal above is a better value. —Scott Gilbertson Our favorite 360 camera, Insta360's X4 (9/10, WIRED Recommends), features a 1/2-inch sensor capable of 8K video, which is as high-resolution as you can get in a 360-degree camera. The 8K resolution means you can reframe your footage to fit rectangular video formats and still have high-quality clips sharp enough to mix with other sources. It doesn’t reframe to 4K (you'll have to wait for 12K footage before that's possible), but it's good enough for anything you'd put on social media. —Scott Gilbertson The Insta360 Go 3S (9/10, WIRED Recommends) is just plain fun. It's a hybrid camera that transforms from a traditional action-camera form factor to a more portable go-anywhere wearable camera. In action camera mode, it's much like the Ace Pro above. The sensor isn't as big so the image quality isn't as good, but you get the flip-up rear screen. The camera itself is waterproof to 33 feet (10 meters). The case can also continue to act as a remote monitor even when you pull the camera out. Couple that with the extremely strong magnetic mounting system on the camera pod, and the Go 3 becomes capable of shots and angles that no other action camera can match. —Scott Gilbertson Fujifilm's Instax Link Wide Printer is my favorite Instax printer. The printers aren't as fun as the cameras, but I already have a digital camera, and the results I get pairing images from a real camera with an Instax printer outshine what I get from Instax cameras. If you already have a good digital camera or a solid smartphone camera, an Instax printer is the way to go and this is the best one to get. I love the bigger images of the Link Wide, and it has nice extras like the ability to print multiple images in one go with collage print or add fun features to your images like hearts, glitter (shudder), or any other of the 15 editable templates in the app. —Scott Gilbertson The Sprocket Photo Printer offers the best results of the ink mini printers we've tested. It's roughly the size of a phone, and connects with iPhone, iPad, or Android phones via Bluetooth. The mobile app lets you edit and customize your photos before printing. There's also an option to tile your images onto multiple prints for a larger, pieced-together image. —Scott Gilbertson The Flir One Gen 3 is the largest of the thermal cameras we've tested. It’s about 2.6 inches wide and 1.3 inches tall, and it fits a lot into that space, including a built-in battery and two cameras. The first is the IF camera which captures 80 x 60-pixel images and then combines them with the second camera, which grabs a higher resolution image of visible light, which the device smooths and scales up to a nice, pretty clear, 1,440 x 1,080-pixel image. —Scott Gilbertson Read next Read next

Title: AMD and Alphabet: Billionaire Steve Cohen Loads Up on 2 Big AI Stocks

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. AI is booming, providing an important pillar of support for the stock market’s substantial year-to-date gains. Put into numerical terms, the tech-heavy NASDAQ composite index, which features many of the AI sector’s major names, has added nearly 30% for this year to date – on top of the 43% gains it registered last year. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter The significance of AI, both as a technological force and an investment opportunity, is underscored by the attention it’s garnering from Wall Street titans – the billionaire investors who’ve made fortunes betting on the right trends. Steve Cohen, the founder and CEO of Point72, is among them. Drawing parallels between the current AI boom and the tech revolution of the 1990s, Cohen views AI not as a speculative bubble but as a ‘really durable’ phenomenon poised to reshape industries and markets. More importantly, Cohen is willing to put his money where his mouth is, and is reportedly preparing to set up a new billion-dollar hedge fund to focus on AI stocks. In the meantime, his main firm, Point72, is already betting heavily on AI, and has opened new positions in Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), two of the industry’s leaders. According to the data from TipRanks, both AMD and GOOGL feature Strong Buy consensus ratings and double-digit upside potential for the coming year. Let’s give them a closer look, and find out just why billionaire investor Steve Cohen is loading up on these two big AI stocks. Advanced Micro Devices First up is AMD, a leading innovator in the semiconductor chip industry – and a company that is angling to challenge the chip giant Nvidia for a larger slice of the AI pie. While AMD is not in the same trillion-dollar league as the market leader Nvidia – its market cap of ~$229 billion ranks it sixth among its peers – the company has built up a solid business for itself, putting a wide range of top-end PC processor and AI-capable accelerator chips on the market. Among AMD’s leading products are several newly announced chips and chipsets, including the Ryzen 7 9800X3D desktop processor, optimized for high-end gaming uses; the Versal Premium Series Gen 2, designed to improve data movement efficiency and to unlock more memory storage in data-intensive markets; and the Instinct MI300A APU, the market’s second exascale accelerator, designed to power the fastest-ever supercomputer. Whatever the immediate application, the common denominator in all of these is AI – AMD’s newest chips have the speed and capacity to handle data-heavy workloads. That’s by design, of course. AMD has strong relationships, based on its AI-capable chips, with such powerful industry names as Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. With its new product offerings, AMD is aiming to expand its role in the global AI market, which the data aggregation site Statista estimates will reach $92 billion in total revenue by the end of 2025. Steve Cohen evidently thinks AMD will be a major player in the field. During Q3, Point72 opened a new position in AMD. The billionaire hedge manager picked up 871,731 shares of the stock, a holding that is worth over $120 million at the current share price. At the end of last month, AMD reported its results for 3Q24. The company’s quarterly revenue was strong, beating the forecast by $110 million and growing more than 17% year-over-year to reach $6.82 billion. Earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS, came to 92 cents per share, in-line with expectations, and up 31% from the prior year. Despite the gains in earnings, shares in AMD are down 17% since the quarterly results were released. While the results were good, investors were disappointed with the firm’s Q4 guidance, which predicted $7.5 billion at the midpoint to the revenue range, below the $7.55 billion that analysts had expected. For TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter, however, the decline in share price creates an opening to buy. Buchalter sums up his bullish view of this stock, writing, “We view AMD’s forward roadmap and progress on building its networking ecosystem reinforcing our confidence it can create and capture value in AI computing. Against a very large and still early AI compute TAM, we believe AMD is well on the way to cementing its position as the de facto merchant alternative to NVIDIA’s leadership position.” The analyst follows this with a Buy rating on the stock, and adds a $185 price target that indicates potential for a 34% gain in the next 12 months. (To watch Buchalter’s track record, click here) The 30 recent analyst reviews on AMD break down 23-to-7 in favor of Buy over Hold, giving the shares their consensus rating of Strong Buy. The $137.72 trading price and $185.46 average target price together imply a potential one-year upside of 34.5%. (See AMD stock forecast) Alphabet Now we’ll turn to Alphabet, the parent company of the internet’s leading search engine, Google, and leading video platform, YouTube. Through these subsidiaries, Alphabet holds the world-leading position in the field of internet search – but more importantly, the company has access to a treasure trove of raw data, the feedstock of AI applications. While the online advertising business based on that data trove has pushed Alphabet to a market cap over $2 trillion, making it the fifth-largest publicly traded firm on Wall Street, it’s the company’s AI bent that is more likely to propel it into the future. Alphabet already makes use of AI to improve results from its search engines, both Google and YouTube, using the tech to offer search suggestions and to target relevant ads to web surfers. Precise ad targeting is key, as Alphabet’s revenue stream comes mainly from its online advertising segment. In addition to its uses in web search and digital advertising, AI is essential to Alphabet’s online translation capabilities. AI-powered large language models (LLMs) allow the company to conduct its ad business around the world in the audiences’ native tongues, and to offer automated translation services that expand users’ horizons to websites outside of their native languages. All of this builds into Alphabet’s Gemini platform, the company’s purpose-built, customer-facing, generative AI platform. Alphabet’s platform is already working with large language models, and can even help users with complex tasks such as computer coding. Alphabet is working to expand Gemini into all of its products – but especially into its Android smartphone operating system. That last will bring a functional AI assistant into the world of smartphone applications, and from there the vistas are endless. Turning to Steve Cohen’s recent GOOGL buys, we find that he bought big last quarter – to the tune of 1,159,225 shares. At the current price, this new position is worth approximately $196 million. In its last quarterly report, for 3Q24, Alphabet’s management stated that the company saw strong success in its core revenue-driving business of online advertising. The company’s ~90% market share in online search provides a strong foundation for the digital ad business. Alphabet’s revenues in the third quarter came to $88.3 billion, growing almost 15% year-over-year and beating the forecast by $2.05 billion. The company’s EPS was also strong, up 37% year-over-year to reach $2.12 per share – and beating the forecast by 27 cents per share. In coverage for Pivotal Research Group, analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak takes note of Alphabet’s leading position in online search and advertising, as well as the company’s strong business lines in AI and cloud computing. He writes of the internet giant, “If the status quo holds, GOOG appears to be in a very strong competitive position with a deep moat around their dominant core search business model (~90% market share ex China) and an obvious path to leverage 90%+ (ex China) global device presence (which we believe will dominate consumer AI assistant use), a strong AI platform and financial might to increase financial incentives to handset manufacturers for default AI placement. GOOG also holds a strong #3 position in cloud computing, which as evidenced by the 3Q acceleration in revenue growth has dramatic growth potential given still relatively low (15-20%) cloud market share of enterprise workloads (+ benefits from AI), controls the largest video/audio streaming platform in the world (YouTube) and the world’s top browser (Chrome) with a 65% global market share (ex-China).” Looking ahead, Wlodarczak puts a Buy rating on GOOGL shares, with a $225 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 33%. (To watch Wlodarczak’s track record, click here) The Strong Buy consensus rating on Alphabet is based on 34 recent Wall Street reviews that favor Buy over Hold by 27 to 7. The shares are priced at $169.12 and the $207.9 average price target points toward a 23% gain in the year ahead.

Title: Stock market today: Indexes slide as tech sell-off ends 7-day winning streak

US stocks ended lower on Wednesday, with the benchmark S&P 500 snapping a seven-day winning streak amid a sell-off in tech. Major averages tumbled after hitting records in Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 100 points and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%. Bond yields were lower, with the 10-year Treasury yield down five basis points to 4.248%. Tech led the declines on Wednesday. Dell shares dropped as much as 12% after the company cut revenue guidance for the fourth quarter. In a call with investors after reporting earnings on Tuesday, Dell called AI a "robust opportunity" for its business but warned that the path would "not be linear," sparking concern over spending in the artificial intelligence space. Mega-cap tech stocks declined during the day, with Nvidia, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta all ending lower. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday: Markets also took in personal consumption expenditures price data for October, the Fed's preferred measure of inflation. Core PCE inflation grew 2.8% year-per-year, slightly hotter than last month, but in line with economists' expectations. Investors ramped up their bets for coming Fed rate cuts, despite earlier concern that central bankers could take a slower approach to easing monetary policy. Odds for a 25 basis point rate cut in December jumped to 70%, though most traders doubt the Fed will follow with another quarter-point cut in January, according to the CME FedWatch tool. "This is a nice Black Friday gift for the Fed," Scott Helfstein, the head of investment strategy at Global X, said in a note. "The inflation numbers came in as expected, accelerating slightly from recent readings, but still very close to the Fed target. This is not likely to alter the Fed rate path and another 25 bp cut in December is still likely." Other market commentators, though, say the path forward is still uncertain. "Today's data shouldn't change views of the likely path for disinflation, however bumpy. But a lot of observers, probably including some at the Fed, are looking for reasons to get more hawkish on the outlook given the potential for inflationary policy change like new tariffs," David Alcaly, the lead macroeconomic strategist at Lazard Asset Management, said in a note.

Joining the now live Amazon Black Friday Week Deals as well as the official Google sale, the Samsung Black Friday bonanza is now offering some wild price drops on its latest foldables. You’ll find the Galaxy Z Flip 6 at $350 off and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 with a wild $800 in savings on select colors to join these new microSD card offers. We are also tracking new all-time low Samsung’s 2024 Odyssey G9 curved gaming monitor with a massive $520 in savings alongside a host of other battlestation displays, not to mention the lowest price to date on the flagship 2024 ANC OnePlus Buds Pro 3 with the vegan leather case. Everything else awaits down below in today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break. The official Samsung Black Friday sale continues and we are now tracking even deeper deals on its latest foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6. Both of these handsets debuted earlier this year as the brand’s latest and greatest in foldable handsets and we are now tracking massive price drops on unlocked units with as much as $800 in savings before you even factor in the trade-in values. Scope out the details below. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: While we already brought you the details on the now live OnePlus Black Friday sale, we are stepping back out today to highlight the all-time pricing it is providing on the brand’s 2024 model OnePlus Buds Pro 3 at $119.99 shipped. Regularly $180, outside of getting bundled in with some of the brand’s smartphones and tablets over the last few months (and right now for Black Friday), straight up cash deals on its latest flagship buds have been light at best. We have never seen them drop below $149 over at Amazon either. Scope out some additional details below. Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As part of its Black Friday Week deals, Amazon is offering Samsung’s latest 49-inch Odyssey G9 (G95C) gaming monitor for $759.98 shipped. This particular gaming display has been sitting at the $1,000 mark lately with some occasional jumps to its full $1,300 price. Today’s 42% or $540 discount on its listed price knocks this model $40 below its previous Amazon all-time low, marking a new low price to beat. The same monitor is currently fetching $800 directly at Samsung as a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, and you can learn more about it below. As part of its Black Friday Week Deals, Amazon is offering up to 40% off a range of the popular YETI tumblers and travel mugs as well as a host of the brand’s coolers, and more. Prices kick off from $17.50 with free shipping for Prime members or in orders over $35. You’ll find Black Friday YETI deals on everything from its wine tumblers and mugs to stainless steel insulated Rambler bottles in various sizes and form-factors, alongside a host of coolers and the like. All of the YETI Black Friday deals are waiting for you right here and you’ll find some picks from the sale down below. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit! If you were waiting for Black Friday 2024 deals to cop Ray-Ban’s Meta smart glasses, then now is your time to strike as they’re seeing a 20% discount right now. This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. Update: While the Samsung site is still offering the $150 price drops below, Amazon is now undercutting those offers on the more affordable 128GB model with deals from $474.99 – this is the lowest price we have tracked to date. As part of its early access Black Friday sale that serving up the best price to date on the new Tab S10 configurations, another one of Samsung’s latest releases is hitting its lowest price to date. While there are some notable trade-in options for the new, more affordable Samsung S24 FE smartphone, the straight cash deals have never been better than they are today. Amazon is still offering all-time lows starting from $574.99, but going directly to Samsung will net you an instant credit that will drop the spend down to the $499.99 all-time low on the 128GB model and the best price yet on the 256GB variant at $559.99 shipped. Details await below. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

Title: 2 Unicorn Lessons From Mark Zuckerberg: Navigate VCs & Master Pivots
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dileeprao/2024/11/27/2-unicorn-lessons-from-mark-zuckerberg-navigate-vcs--master-pivots/
Time Published: 2024-11-27T16:15:58Z
Full Content:
Lessons from Mark Zuckerberg (Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty ... [+] Images) Mark Zuckerberg’s journey offers invaluable lessons for entrepreneurs. He has built a unicorn by starting Facemash, building Facebook, and transforming it into Meta. His journey offers invaluable lessons on achieving sustained success and building growth ventures —and how you can apply these principles to your own entrepreneurial journey. Billion-dollar entrepreneurs achieve their success by entering emerging trends before they take off – then dominating them. Zuckerberg entered the Internet 2.0 era during the rise of social networking and dominated it. Zuckerberg’s ability to recognize the emerging potential of social networking gave him a foothold in an industry primed for explosive growth. His strategy mirrors that of other billion-dollar entrepreneurs who leveraged the potential of emerging industries: · Medical Electronics: Earl Bakken co-founded Medtronic and capitalized on the emerging medical electronics industry (Bootstrap to Billions). · Big-Box Retail: Sam Walton (Walmart) and Dick Schulze (Best Buy) capitalized on the growth of big-box retailing. · Personal Computers: Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Michael Dell (Dell) shaped the emerging PC industry. · Telecommunications: Ralph Roberts (Comcast) pioneered cable TV when it was emerging. · Internet 1.0: Early Internet pioneers like Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com), and Page and Brin (Google) laid the foundation for today’s digital economy. · Internet 3.0: Entrepreneurs like Brian Chesky (Airbnb) and Travis Kalanick (Uber) disrupted traditional industries through the sharing economy. First movers often stumble because they must flawlessly execute every aspect of the venture. Smart followers, however, can often refine and improve an idea, launch and pivot as needed, then scale it effectively. Zuckerberg exemplifies this. Like 89% of ultimate winners, Zuckerberg succeeded not by being a first mover but by being a smart follower and an even smarter pivoter and builder. His ability to learn and pivot was key to Facebook’s domination and its transformation into Meta. Here are the strategic pivots that helped Zuckerberg succeed. Zuckerberg’s journey highlights the importance of entering an industry early – even when the landscape is hazy. Nearly all Unicorn-Entrepreneurs got in when the industry was emerging and pivoting to the right strategy. Zuckerberg entered the emerging Internet-linking industry space using Facemash. When he was introduced to the Facebook concept by three Harvard students, Zuckerberg pivoted to create Facebook. By initially targeting elite universities, he differentiated Facebook from direct competitors like Rupert Murdoch’s MySpace, and won. Zuckerberg’s decision to acquire Instagram was pivotal to Facebook’s path to social media dominance. Initially hesitant, he pivoted quickly when Instagram secured $50 million in VC at a $500 million valuation. Recognizing Instagram’s potential, he closed the deal at $1 billion within days – a bold move that solidified Meta’s dominance in social media. Zuckerberg invested heavily in augmented reality, spending significant time and money on the Metaverse concept and acquiring Oculus Rift for a few billion dollars. But when artificial intelligence (AI) emerged as a transformative force, he pivoted Meta’s focus to AI-driven solutions, boosting both sales and the company’s stock price. Zuckerberg can pivot because he controls more than 50% of Facebook’s voting rights even though he owns less than 30% of the company. Zuckerberg demanded proxies from VCs to maintain control. By keeping control, Zuckerberg ensured that VCs did not second-guess his strategy or his leadership. If entrepreneurs want to lead with independence, Zuckerberg’s example highlights the importance of structuring deals to retain control. 94% of billion-dollar entrepreneurs leveraged skills and finance-smart strategies to avoid VC or delay it. This allowed them to keep control. Zuckerberg is a prime example. He first honed his tech skills to enter an emerging trend and was offered $1 million to improve the software he had developed as a teenager. Besides technical skills, entrepreneurs must also develop startup skills, pivoting skills, and growth skills. MY TAKE: Zuckerberg offers a masterclass in building a unicorn by pivoting to leverage trends and adapting strategies effectively. He can do so because he retained control over Facebook and over the VCs to avoid VC-interference. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 review: a super-solid analog gaming keyboard with top performance
URL: https://www.techradar.com/computing/keyboards/steelseries-apex-pro-tkl-gen-3-review
Time Published: 2024-11-27T14:40:59Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Steelseries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 is a brilliantly made gaming keyboard with delectable performance, thanks to its well-engineered analog switches. The tweaks available courtesy of the accompanying software are great too, although the lack of controller emulation is a shame. The price of entry is steep too, but if you’re looking for superb feel and a durable build, the Apex Pro fits the bill brilliantly. Great performance Well made Good software Expensive Unergonomic wrist rest Lacking analog tweaks Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The Steelseries Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 is a premium gaming keyboard with analog switches, designed to provide the most accurate and tweakable gaming experience possible. It certainly looks the part: its understated appearance doesn’t scream gaming prowess, but when you peer further, the quality is evident from every angle. The chassis is relatively thick but not as weighty as you might expect, and it feels solid and expertly put together, easily among the best gaming keyboards around. The same is true of the wrist pad and the stock double-shot PBT keycaps, which have a slight but smooth texture that’s satisfying to touch. The inbuilt Smart Screen sits in the top right corner, and can be used to select profiles, change the global actuation point and toggle Rapid Trigger. It can also be customized to display information pertaining to your system or popular games and apps. You can even upload your own images and GIFs too. Further customizations can be made via Steelseries peripheral software, GG. Here, you can tinker with the actuation points further, on a global or key-by-key basis. You can also set functions to trigger on press or release, and add two binds to a single key, with each triggered at different actuation points of your choosing. It’s a shame, though, that GG provides no visual feedback when making such adjustments, and there’s no option to emulate the joysticks or triggers of a controller, as can be done on some other analog keyboards, such as the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro. However, the gaming performance of the Apex Pro makes up for this omission. The switches are extremely responsive yet offer enough feedback to make hitting actuation points easy. The relatively compact layout also makes the bottom row accessible, as does the sloped nature of these keys. All keycaps are also nicely indented, making for secure presses. The only gripe I have is with the short, flat wrist rest, which caused my palm to hang off the edge when in the WASD position. I didn’t find the Apex Pro to be as amenable for typing. However, I generally prefer shallow keycaps to glide around on, so those who prefer thicker keycaps may have no issue here. The Apex Pro is expensive, costing the same as the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro, another analog offering. But with the high price tag comes supreme build quality and performance, and although it misses out on a few analog tweaks, it’s still well worth your consideration. The Apex Pro TKL Gen 3 costs $219 / £209 (about AU$336) and is available now. It comes in one colorway, black. It also includes a wrist rest and a keycap puller, with Steelseries selling replacement keycaps on its website. Unsurprisingly, it’s less expensive than the wireless variant, which costs $269 – but as well as ditching the wires, that model offers multiple connectivity modes, meaning you can easily switch it between multiple devices. The Apex Pro is certainly towards the top end of the wired gaming keyboard market. It’s the same price as the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless, for instance, which uses Hall-effect analog technology as well. That board can also be tweaked using Razer Synapse, the brand’s excellent, feature-packed peripheral software. If you’re after a more budget-friendly analog keyboard, then the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro is a possible contender. Unlike the Apex Pro, it offers controller emulation, although its switches aren’t as precise as we would’ve liked for this purpose. Even though it has its issues, it’s still one to consider. Value: 3 / 5 The Apex Pro is a fairly imposing slab, with a thick yet sleek chassis, and its muted looks belie its gaming intentions; the RGB lighting is about the only giveaway in this regard. The build quality is where the Apex Pro really stands out, though. It’s quite weighty, although not as heavy as you might expect, but every material and joint is exquisite. There’s also a handy compartment underneath housing the keycap puller, with a rubber flap to close it that works well. The double-shot PBT keycaps feel premium to the touch, with a slight yet smooth texture. The overall layout is reasonably compact, but I didn’t have any issues with mispresses. The Apex Pro also features Steelseries’ own modifier key, called the Meta key. This allows you to perform various shortcuts, such as adjusting the actuation point and selecting profile slots. Such alterations can also be made via the Smart Screen. This uses a black and white OLED display, with navigation controlled via a scroll wheel and a small button below – both of which are just as well engineered as the rest of the Apex Pro. You can set the global actuation point from anywhere between 0.1mm and 4mm, and toggle Rapid Trigger. The Smart Screen can also be used to display certain system information, including workloads for the CPU, GPU and RAM, which is very useful. In-game information can be displayed too, with many popular games having their own default layouts, including those for Counter-Strike 2, Minecraft, and League of Legends. You can even upload your own images and GIFs to display. Further actuation settings can be adjusted in SteelSeris’ GG software. You can change the actuation of individual keys, and set keys to trigger on press or release. There’s also a dual actuation mode, letting you bind two functions to a single key, each triggered at certain actuation points of your choosing. Other rebinding options include those for common shortcuts, media playback and system-level functions, although there aren’t as many on the latter front as some other peripheral tools offer. You can also customize the information the Smart Screen displays with a pleasing amount of depth and detail, selecting the timings for when certain information is displayed and what triggers it. In Counter-Strike 2, for example, you can view your health, as well as your K/D ratio at the end of each round. As well as games, some apps are also integrated, such as Discord, which can display messages. Overall, GG is easy to navigate and responsive. One aspect that is disappointing, though, is the lack of visual feedback when adjusting settings, which would’ve been useful when setting actuation points to see how your inputs actually translate in real time. Design & features: 4 / 5 Put simply, the Apex Pro is a joy to use. The damping of the switches is superb, feeling incredibly satisfying to use while still being snappy enough for fast movements. The indentations of the keycaps also makes them secure and easy to use, and the bottom row is easy to hit with your thumb and little fingers, thanks to the slope of these keys and the aforementioned compact layout. Hitting certain actuation points is also much easier than I’ve experienced with other analog keyboards, as there’s enough feedback to get a good feel as to how far down you’ve pressed. Rapid trigger also works brilliantly, letting you make those twitchy movements even quicker, by dynamically raising the actuation point when repeated presses are registered. My chief nag from an ergonomic standpoint, though, is with the wrist rest. Given the aforementioned thickness of the Apex Pro’s chassis, I found the rest was definitely needed. However, since it’s quite short and provides very little slope, I found that the edge of my palm would hang awkwardly off the end when in the WASD position. Also, when it comes to typing, I didn’t find the Apex Pro to be easiest to use. However, I should say that I mostly prefer shallow, laptop-style keyboards, as I find them easier to glide around on, which the stock keycaps on the Apex Pro are not particularly conducive to. But if you’re someone who prefers thicker keycaps for typing, then you’ll likely not have an issue here. Performance: 4.5 / 5 You want precise analog controlThe analog switches are a dream, providing plenty of feedback for accurate actuation-point hitting. You want the best gaming performanceAside from that analog control, the switches are snappy when needs be, so there’s no gaming situation that catches it out. You want to use it with multiple devicesSince there’s only a wired connection, you can’t easily hotswap between multiple devices, as you can with the wireless variant. You want to emulate a controllerDespite the analog switches, you can’t emulate controller joysticks or triggers (not natively anyway). Razer Huntsman V2 AnalogIf you have your heart set on an analog keyboard, then the Razer Huntsman V2 Analog is a worthy choice (it’s our pick as the best gaming keyboard around, after all). With its excellent performance and myriad of customization options courtesy of Razer Synapse, you can’t go far wrong with this board. And since the release of version 3, the V2 can be found for a good price. Read our Razer Huntsman V2 Analog review. SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3For $50 more, you can get the wireless version of the Apex Pro TKL, which helps to eliminate the clutter from your desk, and allows you to do some sofa gaming too. And since it features Bluetooth and wired options in addition to the 2.4GHz dongle, you can use it with multiple devices and switch between them with ease. I tested the Apex Pro for several days and used it to game, work, and browse. I used both with and without the included wrist rest. I played games such as Counter-Strike 2, which is a great test for a keyboard’s responsiveness and accuracy. I also made sure to try out as many features as possible, and tinker with as many settings as I could using the GG software. I have been PC gaming for over a decade, and I have used plenty of keyboards during that time. I have also reviewed a number of keyboards with varying price tags, sizes, and switch types.

Nvidia once again posted a $2 billion beat to consensus revenue estimates in Q3, reporting YoY growth of nearly 94% to over $35 billion in revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled in the quarter to over $30 billion with Hopper driving the second largest data center beat in company history, speaking volumes as to the level of demand for its GPUs given that Blackwell will not initially ship until next quarter. As recapped to our premium members after the earnings report, the I/O Fund is tracking supply chain signals indicating the next generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. Beating on data center revenue is becoming common place for Nvidia, yet what’s interesting is the data center segment posted the largest surprise relative to estimates since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24. Nvidia reported $35.08 billion in revenue versus consensus of $33.13 billion. A bar graph illustrating Nvidia’s impressive revenue performance, showcasing a $35.08 billion ... [+] revenue surpassing the consensus estimate of $33.13 billion. This marks the largest data center segment beat since Hopper’s breakout quarter in FY24, highlighting Nvidia’s consistent outperformance in the data center sector. Data center revenue of $30.77 billion increased 112.0% YoY and 17.1% QoQ, beating estimates by $1.95 billion. This marked the largest beat since the $2.46 billion beat in Q2 FY24, as well as the two $1.8 billion beats in Q3 FY24 and Q1 FY25. This is important as this beat was driven solely by Hopper – which is in its seventh quarter with the H100s and H200s. Blackwell’s is expected to ramp quickly in Q4 and into next year. Analysts estimate Blackwell’s volume in Q4 could be between 150,000 and 200,000, before tripling sequentially to 550,000 in Q1 FY26 (Jan-Apr quarter of 2025). The expectation for AI clusters is to go from tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands, to millions of GPUs, indicating a long runway for Blackwell and subsequent GPU generations. What’s shaping up for 2025 is the convergence of multiple strong tailwinds for Nvidia to capture via Blackwell: GPU clusters this generation beginning at the upper end of Hopper’s hundred-thousand clusters, Big Tech capex continuing to increase past one quarter trillion (which we covered two weeks ago), and more importantly, Blackwell’s pricing power versus Hopper. Q3 earnings aside, this bigger picture is that Nvidia’s Blackwell GPU sales next year will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 — combined. 2025 is shaping up to be potentially the most important year for Nvidia since I first highlighted Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis in my free stock newsletter in November 2018 and when the I/O Fund entered at $3.15 for returns of 3,280%. Including Q4’s estimate, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion to $130 billion in data center revenue in 2023 and 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone. Back in August, in the analysis Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings, I wrote: ‘According to reports from Wccftech: “Team Green is expected to ship 60,000 to 70,000 units of NVIDIA's GB200 AI servers, and given that one server is reported to cost around $2 million to $3 million per unit, this means that Team Green will bag in around a whopping $210 billion from just Blackwell servers along, that too in a year. The weight of that report cannot be overstated as it implies 26% upside to 2025’s estimates based on one SKU alone.” Despite Blackwell not yet shipping in full volume, there are multiple data points that support this ramp to $200+ billion in revenue. Perhaps the most important quote was one that could easily be overlooked — Nvidia’s management explained in Q3’s earnings that they have “completed a successful mask change for Blackwell…that improved production yields. Blackwell production shipments are scheduled to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and will continue to ramp into fiscal 2026.” Since both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem beginning in Q4, there’s more emphasis on supply constraints moving forward, as management was clear in saying that both products have “certain supply constraints” with Blackwell’s demand “expected to exceed supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026.” Broadly speaking, supply constraints are nothing new as it’s been widely understood Blackwell is already sold out for next year. By executing this mask change to improve production yields, Nvidia can theoretically get more usable chips per wafer, alleviating some supply fears and allowing it to meet higher demand levels, leading to higher revenue generation. Management already hinted at this, saying “we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated.” CEO Jensen Huang also explained that GPU clusters with Blackwell will be starting where Hopper left off: “You see now that at the tail-end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells.” Even though Nvidia guided Q4 nearly in-line with analysts' expectations at $37.5 billion, there is still significant room for Blackwell to grow through 2025. Current forecasts point to revenue surpassing the $50 billion-mark one year from now, with revenue growth in excess of 40% for the next five quarters. A table displaying the wide range of analyst revenue estimates for Nvidia in FY26, highlighting a ... [+] $40 billion range for Q3 and a $70 billion range for Q4. The potential for Nvidia to achieve over $50 billion in quarterly data center revenue is also noted. Interestingly, there is still a massive disconnect in analyst estimates as FY26 progresses – estimates for Q3 have a nearly $40 billion range from the low to high estimates. When looking at Q4 of next year, there is a ridiculous $70 billion range, with some analysts predicting $31 billion at the low end while others have estimates as high as $101 billion. Should Nvidia maintain its quarterly cadence of beating by $2 billion from the midpoint of these estimates, and assuming data center mix remains at ~90%, Nvidia could easily exit FY26 with data center revenue at >$50 billion/quarter, or $200+ billion annualized compared to data center revenue of $140 billion this year. Big Tech’s capex supports this revenue growth story, as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Alphabet have all accelerated capex significantly in the past couple of quarters and reaffirmed the need to continue investing aggressively in AI infrastructure moving through 2025. Additionally, Big Tech is already spending tens of billions on Nvidia’s Blackwell lineup: This is but a fraction of 2025’s estimated capex– 2024’s capex could come in at ~$240 billion with an estimated $70 billion spent in Q4, with the four currently tracking for over $270 billion in capex predominantly for AI infrastructure in 2025. Nvidia has been capturing a lion’s share of AI spending from Big Tech, at ~80% to 85%, and assuming little change in its AI GPU market share with competition primarily arising from AMD and no one else, Big Tech’s spending implies a clear path towards $200 billion in GPU revenue in 2025. The importance of Big Tech’s capex was also echoed with the CEO stating we will see $1 trillion in data infrastructure rebuild before he expects to see digestion from the hyperscalers. Per Huang: “I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize a trillion dollars with the data centers.” That would imply another 3X from here for the remaining three-quarter trillion – not in stock price, but in capex. Presumably, it would mean a higher trajectory for the stock price in terms of valuing that revenue. Hopper drove another beat, which Nvidia is becoming widely known for. It’s rare for analysts to openly expect large beats going into a print, yet UBS had correctly tagged the beat this quarter at $2 billion. However, due to declining from peak revenue growth of 265% earlier this year, Hopper-driven growth of 94% is not what will drive the stock up for the next leg higher. Nvidia investors, such as myself, will need Blackwell’s pricing power and Blackwell’s clear demand signals to re-invigorate the stock. Nvidia reported 93.6% YoY growth, more than 10 points higher than consensus estimates for ~83% YoY growth. Nvidia is now lapping its peak growth quarters, Q4 FY24 and Q1 FY25, where revenue peaked at 265% growth due to Hopper ramping tremendously fast. Growth technically is decelerating nearly 30 points in Q3 and growth will further decelerate nearly 24 points next quarter, but to be reporting above 93% YoY and almost 70% YoY versus 200-260%+ growth comps is still a very strong report to say the least. A graph illustrating Nvidia’s year-over-year growth rates, showing a deceleration from peak growth ... [+] of 265% to current growth of 94%. The graph highlights Nvidia’s consistent beats against analyst estimates, driven by Hopper, and the anticipated future impact of Blackwell. For Q4, management guided for revenue of $37.5 billion, +/- 2%, just slightly ahead of consensus estimates for $37.02 billion at the midpoint. Analysts are now expecting $38.01 billion in revenue for Q4, just a week after the report, at the upper end of the guided range. Both Hopper and Blackwell will be shipping in tandem moving forward as Blackwell ramps significantly through fiscal 2026. Analysts were nitpicking margins, yet this concern is overblown. Q3’s margins were relatively in line with guidance despite the $2 billion top-line beat, and for Q4, management forecast margins to contract nearly 2 points sequentially. However, CFO Colette Kress was clear that following Blackwell, gross margin will eventually return to its current percentage: “As Blackwell ramps, we expect gross margins to moderate to the low-70s. When fully ramped, we expect Blackwell margins to be in the mid-70s.” Investors should never underestimate Wall Street’s ability to miss the bigger picture. Analysts on the call cross-examined this 200 bp sequential decline despite Nvidia having an operating margin of over 60% compared to most of the Mag 7 having operating margins at half that. It’s also completely normal for semiconductors to feel margin pressures in the initial stages of ramping a new product, especially at this scale and pace. A chart showing Nvidia’s operating margins, highlighting the anticipated 2-point sequential decline ... [+] in Q4 and the projected return to mid-70s gross margins with the ramp-up of Blackwell. The chart emphasizes Nvidia’s strong current margins compared to industry peers. The bigger picture for Nvidia moving forward is that Blackwell holds the potential to dwarf Hopper’s revenue generation in fewer quarters. Breaking it down further on CNBC, I stated Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power I had been quite vocal prior to earnings that Q3’s report was nothing but a blip in the longer-term picture, with 2025 being much more important than this quarterly report. The I/O Fund is already tracking a 30% minimum difference between GB200 NVL72 orders and what the Street has estimated for next year. When adding that the DGX B200 systems will be priced 40% higher, and assuming pricing power affects more SKUs the way it will affect the DGX B200 systems, then it’s possible to see about 70% upside next year for Nvidia. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The I/O Fund has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pull back, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from the semiconductor industry and meaningfully breakout. The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche, with 9 buys and real-time alerts from 2021 to 2022 below $20. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. For a limited time, get up to $250 off with one of our biggest sales of the year starting Nov 28th.

Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information are in the prospectus. Please read the prospectuses carefully before you invest. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs and ZEGA Financial is their sub-adviser. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX and YMAG generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Trump’s tariffs promise chaos — and Australia’s investments are in the firing line

End-of-year sale now on Contact us on: support@crikey.com.au Australia's Future Fund has more than 40% of its assets invested in the US economy, which means the damage Trump inflicts hurts us too. Glenn Dyer and Bernard Keane Nov 27, 2024 21 Too bad if you’re a US company, like an automobile manufacturer, reliant on imports from Mexico. Donald Trump just promised to impose a 25% tax on your supply chain, along with everything else imported from Mexico. And Canada. The fact Trump himself negotiated and signed a free trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020, is apparently irrelevant. And he’s announced a 10% “just for starters” tariff on Chinese imports. In response — even though Trump won’t be inaugurated for another two months — sharemarkets fell, but the US dollar rose (sending the Australian dollar falling further). The greenback had already risen against major currencies after Trump’s victory on November 5, and will likely appreciate every time the president-elect announces new tariffs — until markets price in the full effect of the tariff wall Trump has promised to erect around America. Each appreciation of the dollar will further erode the competitiveness of US exports and improve the competitiveness of imports against American products — undermining the very point of Trump’s taxes. Given how little grasp he appears to have about who bears the costs of tariffs, Trump will possibly react by simply increasing tariffs further. Along with his promise to deport every undocumented worker in the country, inflicting serious labour shortages on industries like construction and agriculture that depend on illegal immigrants for much of their workforce, and his threats to curtail the independence of the Federal Reserve, the tariffs will make for extremely uncertain times for US business — and investors in the US. Prominent among such investors is Australia’s Future Fund. Page 61 of the Fund’s 2023-24 annual report reveals that 43% of its $229.7 billion in assets are located in America via a heavy US weighting of listed and private equity, property, infrastructure and credit. That compares to just 27% of its assets invested in Australia, and is up from 39% in 2022-23. That’s a substantial change from before the pandemic: in 2019-20, Australia held the biggest share of the Future Fund’s assets — 39% against 31% for the US. The shift has also been lucrative for the Fund, which has benefitted from a stronger performance of Wall Street. US stocks have had a huge run since the start of 2023 with a 54% gain for the S&P 500, much of that coming from stocks like Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Alphabet and Amazon. That index is up 26% this year to date against a 9.8% rise for the Australian ASX 200. But what about from here? It is hard to see how Trump’s tariffs, deportations and intervention in monetary policy will do anything else than damage US investor and consumer confidence, help slow the fall in inflationary pressures both in America and globally, reduce US exports and eventually undermine stock markets. Trump’s first presidency doesn’t appear to be a reliable guide: Wall Street rose by more than 40% during his first stint in the White House, but much of that was due to a huge pandemic surge from March 2020 that had little to do with Trump. What measures and hedging is the Fund putting in place to curb the risk posed by the next Trump presidency? An update on how it views the risks of its heavy investment in the US economy would be worthwhile — especially given the government is pressuring the fund to invest more in its favoured sectors here in Australia. It would be good to know if any shifts in weightings are because of risk management, rather than being responsive to Jim Chalmers’ interference. Have something to say about this article?

Trump's campaign promises — from tariffs to mass deportations, tax cuts and deregulation — and his picks to lead federal agencies suggest both risks and rewards for various investment sectors, according to market experts. Republican control of both chambers of Congress may grant Trump greater leeway to enact his pledges, experts said. However, their scope and timing is far from clear. Here's a look at other stories impacting the financial advisor business. "There's so much uncertainty right now," said Jeremy Goldberg, a certified financial planner, portfolio manager and research analyst at Professional Advisory Services, which ranked No. 37 on CNBC's annual Financial Advisor 100 list. "I wouldn't be making large bets one way or another," Goldberg said. Past market results show why it's difficult to predict the sectors that may win or lose under a new president, according to Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James. When Trump was elected in 2016, financials, industrials and energy outperformed the S&P 500 in the first week. However, for the remaining three years and 51 weeks, those same sectors significantly underperformed, Adam said. "The market is known to have these knee-jerk reactions trying to anticipate where things go very quickly, but they don't necessarily last," Adam said. What's more, sectors that are expected to do well or badly based on a president's policies have sometimes gone the opposite way, according to Adam. For example, the energy sector was down by 8.4% during Trump's first administration, despite deregulation, record oil production and a rise in oil prices. Yet the energy sector climbed 22.9% under Biden as of Nov. 19, despite the administration's push for renewables and sustainability. For that reason, Raymond James ranks politics eighth for its potential impact on sectors. The seven factors that have more influence, according to the firm, are economic growth, fundamentals, monetary policy, interest rates and inflation, valuations, sentiment and corporate activity. Here's how Trump's policy stances could influence eight sectors: autos, banks, building materials and construction, cryptocurrency, energy, health care, retail and technology. The auto sector — like many others — will likely be a mixed bag, experts said. Trump's antipathy for electric vehicles is likely to create headwinds for EV producers. His administration may try to roll back regulations such as a Biden-era tailpipe-emissions rule expected to push broader adoption of EVs and hybrids. He also intends to kill consumer EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 — although states such as California may try to enact their own EV rebates, blunting the impact. Losing the federal credit would make EVs more costly, driving down sales and perhaps making "per unit economics even less favorable" for automakers, John Murphy, a research analyst at Bank of America Securities, wrote in a Nov. 21 research note. Some companies seem well-positioned, though: Ford Motor, for example, "has a healthy pipeline of hybrid vehicles as well as traditional [internal combustion engine] vehicles to supplement the EV offerings," Murphy wrote. Tariffs and trade conflict pose threats to the auto industry, since the U.S. relies heavily on other nations to manufacture cars and parts, said Callie Cox, chief market strategist at Ritholtz Wealth Management. They "could affect the cost and availability of cars we see in the U.S. market," Cox said. Economists expect tariffs and other Trump policies to be inflationary. In that case, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated. Higher borrowing costs may weigh on consumers' desire or ability to buy cars, Cox said. However, lower EV production could be a boon for companies that manufacture traditional gasoline cars, experts said. Trump has also called for a "drill, baby, drill" approach to oil production. Greater supply could reduce gas prices, supporting demand for gas vehicles, experts said. But trade wars and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela could have the opposite impact, too. — Greg Iacurci Trump's first administration eased certain regulations for banking rules, fintech firms and financial startups. Likewise, Trump's second term is expected to usher in lighter financial regulations. That may help bolster profitability in the sector, and therefore stock prices, said Brian Spinelli, co-chief investment officer at Halbert Hargrove in Long Beach, California, which is No. 54 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "The larger banks probably benefit more from that," Spinelli said. Less regulation — combined with the prospect that interest rates could stay higher — will provide a net positive for the bank industry, since banks may be able to lend out more risk-based capital, said David Rea, president of Salem Investment Counselors in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is No. 8 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. One issue that emerged this year that could resurface is concern about regional banks' exposure to commercial real estate, Spinelli said. "It wasn't that long ago, and I don't think those problems disappeared," Spinelli said. "So you question, is that still looming out there?" — Lorie Konish The housing market has been "frozen" in recent years by high mortgage rates, said Cox, of Ritholtz. Lower rates would likely be a "catalyst" for housing and associated companies, she said. However, that may not materialize — quickly, at least — under Trump, she said. If policies such as tariffs, tax cuts and mass deportations stoke inflation, the Federal Reserve may have to keep interest rates higher for longer than anticipated, which would likely prop up mortgage rates and weigh on housing and related sectors, she said. The whims of the housing market affect retailers, too: Home goods stores may not fare well if people aren't buying, renovating and decorating new homes, Cox said. That said, deregulation could be "absolutely huge" for the sector if it accelerates building timelines and reduces costs for developers, Goldberg said. Trump has called for opening public land to builders and creating tax incentives for homebuyers, without providing much detail. Housing policy will be "one of the most-watched initiatives coming out of the next administration," Cox said. "We haven't gotten a lot of clarity on that front." "If we see realistic and well-thought-out policies, you could see real estate stocks and related stocks" such as real estate investment trusts, home improvement retailers and home builders respond well, Cox said. — Greg Iacurci Trump's election has brought a new bullishness to cryptocurrencies, with bitcoin nearing a new $100,000 benchmark before its recent runup ended. As president, Trump is expected to embrace crypto more than any of his predecessors. Notably, he has already launched a crypto platform, World Liberty Financial, that will encourage the use of digital coins. Those developments come as new ways of investing in crypto have emerged this year, with the January launch of spot bitcoin ETFs, and more recently, the addition of bitcoin ETF options. Yet financial advisors are hesitant, with only about 2.6% recommending crypto to their clients, an April survey from Cerulli Associates found. Roughly 12.1% said they would be willing to use it or discuss it based on the client's preference. Still, 58.9% of advisors said they do not expect to ever use cryptocurrency with clients. "The No. 1 reason why advisors aren't investing in cryptocurrency on behalf of their clients is they don't believe it's suitable for client portfolios," said Matt Apkarian, associate director in Cerulli's product development practice. Even for advisors who do expect they may use crypto at some point, it's "wait and see," particularly regarding how the regulatory environment plays out, Apkarian said. However, investors are showing interest in cryptocurrency, with 90% of advisors receiving questions on the subject, according to research from Christina Lynn, a certified financial planner and practice management consultant at Mariner Wealth Advisors. For those investors, exchange-traded funds are a good starting place, Lynn said, since there's less chance of falling victim to one of crypto's pitfalls such as scams or losing the keys, the unique alphanumeric codes attached to the investments. Because crypto can be more volatile, it's best not to invest any money you expect you'll need to pay for near-term goals, she said. Investors would also be wise to think of cryptocurrency like an alternative investment and limit the allocation to 1% to 5% of their overall portfolio, Lynn said. "You don't need to have a lot of this to have it go a long way," Lynn said. — Lorie Konish As of Nov. 19, energy has been the top-performing sector under President Joe Biden, with a 22.9% gain, even with the administration's push for renewables and sustainability, according to Raymond James. Yet it remains to be seen whether that performance can continue under Trump, who has advocated for more oil, gas and coal production. The outlook for the sector could change if Trump acts on a campaign threat to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, a law enacted under Biden that includes clean energy incentives. If Trump continues to make it easier to create more oil supply, that might not be a great thing for oil companies, according to Adam, of Raymond James. "Because there's more supply, it may tamp down on the price of oil, and that's one of the biggest drivers of that sector," Adam said. Eagle Global Advisors, a Houston-based investment management firm that specializes in energy infrastructure, is "cautiously optimistic" about Trump's impact on the sector, according to portfolio manager Mike Cerasoli. Eagle Global Advisors is No. 35 on the 2024 CNBC FA 100 list. "We would say we're probably more on the optimistic side than the cautious side," Cerasoli said. "But if we know anything about Trump it's that he's a wild card." A lot of the Inflation Reduction Act may stay intact, since the top states that benefited financially from the law also handed Trump a victory in the election, according to Cerasoli. When Biden won in 2020, there was a lot of panic about the outlook for energy, oil and gas. Cerasoli recalls writing in a third-quarter letter that year, "I don't think it's going to be as bad as you think." Four years later, he has the same message for investors on the outlook for renewables. In the days following Trump's inauguration, Cerasoli expects there may be a deluge of executive orders. "Once you get past that, you'll get a sense of exactly how he's going to treat energy," Cerasoli said. "I think people will realize that it's not the end of the world for renewables." — Lorie Konish Trump nominated Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. RFK would be a "huge wild card" for the health-care sector if the U.S. Senate were to confirm him, said Goldberg, of Professional Advisory Services. RFK is a prominent vaccine skeptic, which may bode ill for big vaccine makers such as Merck, Pfizer and Moderna, said David Weinstein, a portfolio manager and senior vice president at Dana Investment Advisors, No. 4 on CNBC's annual FA 100 ranking. Cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, are also likely on the table to reduce government spending and raise money for a tax-cut package, experts said. Publicly traded health companies such as Centene, HCA Healthcare and UnitedHealth might be affected by lower volumes of Medicaid patients or consumers who face higher health-care premiums after losing ACA subsidies, for example, Weinstein said. Medical tech providers — especially those that supply electronics with semiconductors sourced from China — could be burdened by tariffs, he added. Conversely, deregulation might help certain pharmaceutical companies such as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Charles River Laboratories, which may benefit from faster approvals from the Food and Drug Administration, Goldberg said. Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotech executive whom Trump appointed as co-head of a new advisory panel called the "Department of Government Efficiency," has called for streamlined drug approvals. But Kennedy has advocated for more oversight. "There's a real dichotomy here," Weinstein said. "Where do we end up? Maybe where we are right now," he added. — Greg Iacurci Tax cuts may boost consumers' discretionary income, which would be a boon for companies selling consumer electronics, clothes, luxury goods and other items, Goldberg said. Then again, there's a "high probability" of tariffs, Weinstein said. Retailers would likely pass on at least some of that additional cost to consumers, experts said. All physical goods, from apparel to footwear, tools and appliances are at risk from tariffs, Weinstein said. Tariff impact would depend on how the policies are structured. Home Depot, Lowe's and Walmart, for example, source a relatively big chunk of their goods from abroad, Weinstein said. Home Depot CEO and President Ted Decker said Nov. 12 during the firm's third-quarter earnings call that the company sources more than half its goods from the U.S. and North America, but "there certainly will be an impact." "Whatever happens in tariffs will be an industrywide impact," Decker said. "It won't discriminate against different retailers and distributors who are importing goods." It's a good idea for investors to own "high quality" retailers without a lot of debt and with diversified inventory sources, Goldberg said. He cited TJX Companies, which owns stores including TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, as an example. "Direct imports are a small portion of [its] business and TJX sources from a variety of countries outside of China," Lorraine Hutchinson, a Bank of America Securities research analyst, wrote in a Nov. 21 note. Deregulation may be positive for smaller retailers and franchises, which tend to be more sensitive to labor laws and environmental and compliance costs, Goldberg said. — Greg Iacurci The technology sector continued its strong run in 2024, thanks in large part to the Magnificent Seven — Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Even broadly diversified investors may find it difficult to escape those names, as they are among the top weighted companies in the S&P 500 index. Information technology — which includes all those stocks except Amazon and Google parent Alphabet — comprises the largest sector in the S&P 500 index, with more than 31%. Trump is poised to have an influence on looming antitrust issues, amid considerations as to whether Google's influence on online search should be limited. Any tariffs put in place may also prompt some sales to decline or the cost of raw materials to go up, said Rea of Salem Investment Counselors. Nevertheless, Rea said his firm continues to have a "pretty heavy" tech allocation, with strong expectations for generative artificial intelligence. However, the firm does not own Tesla, due to its expensive valuation, and has recently been selling software company Palantir, a winning stock that may have gotten ahead of itself, he said. Technology valuations are trading well into the high double digits on a price-to-earnings basis, which often signals forward returns will decline, according to Halbert Hargrove's Spinelli. Consequently, prospective investors who come in now would basically be buying high, he said. "If you think you're going to get the same double-digit returns in the next five years, sure, it could happen on a one-year basis," Spinelli said. "But your chances historically have been that your returns come down." — Lorie Konish Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Moving through the big shopping week with the ongoing Samsung Black Friday sale, Google’s main event, and more, today we are starting with a big-time offer on Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. You can now score a set down at $189 with a FREE $20 Amazon gift card attached alongside these notable Black Friday deals on some of Samsung’s latest microSD cards. We also spotted the very first deal on the all-new Bose QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds and today marks the start of the massive Razer PC gaming sale with up to 60% off a giant collection of its sought-after peripherals and gaming laptops. Head below for a closer look at all of this and more. The Samsung Black Friday sale is now live, but so is the Amazon Black Friday Week Deals, and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro price drops are now at the ready. While you will find the regularly $250 flagship earbuds marked down to $189.99 shipped directly from Samsung, Amazon is sweetening the pot significantly with its own deal price at $188.98 shipped alongside a FREE $20 Amazon gift card with purchase. That’s a total value of $270 and of $81 in effective savings when you factor in the value of the gift card you’ll be able to use towards additional Black Friday deals if you order sooner than not. As per usual, if you have some gear to trade-in against the new Galaxy Buds Pro 3, you can score an up to $100 instant trade-in credit against the already marked down purchase price here. That would leave you with a price at $90 for the new 2024 in-ears, and the lowest price on the internet, but only if you have some gear to flip in the holster. Featured deal: Roborock is launching its biggest deals of the year for Black Friday 2024, delivering up to 67% in savings on many of its most sought-after smart cleaning bots. The Roborock Qrevo series is seeing as much as $650 in savings ahead of Thanksgiving this year alongside up to $700 off the going rate on a range of other models in its lineup of intelligent vacuum and mopping systems. The Roborock deals kick off starting from $140 this year and you’ll find some highlights listed below: There are a bunch of super notable Bose headphone and earbud deals live right now for Black Friday, many of which are found down below, but we also spotted the very fist price drop on its brand new QuietComfort Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds at $149 shipped. Now live at Amazon and directly from Bose, these buds released back in mid-September to take on the new AirPods 4, but have now dropped down in price to undercut Apple’s new ANC-equipped 4th-gen buds. Bose Black Friday headphone and earbuds deals Featured deal: Narwal has now kicked off its official 2024 Black Friday sale with both its latests and greatest intelligent cleaning bots alongside some ultra-affordable models at under $280. You’ll find its latest flagship model with a massive $400 in savings as well as Freo X – it most powerful model – at its lowest price ever with 50% in savings, not to mention a solid $100 price drop on its “one-pass perfection” upright vacuum and mop solution. As a part of its ongoing Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering the 512GB variant of its latest EVO Select microSD card with Adapter for $32.99 shipped. Regularly $40, this half TB variant is now on sale for the same $33 tag at Amazon to deliver the lowest price we have tracked for it to date. The 512GB unit, along with the other capacity models, first landed earlier this year as an upgraded version of Samsung’s mid-tier microSD solution, and it’s fetching $7 less than its previous all-time low price right now. The 1TB variant is also on sale at $79.99 shipped. You’re looking at the latest EVO Select memory card which is faster than the older one with speeds reaching 160MB/s, up from 130MB/s. There’s also a faster PRO Plus microSD card out there from Samsung which is currently fetching $49.99 shipped for Black Friday, down from its usual price of $76. Featured deal: The Yaber Black Friday sale has arrived with hundreds in savings across its lineup of home projectors starting from just $133. The brand’s K3 Google TV projector solution provides direct access to Netflix and 7,000 other apps, with JBL audio, and a design ready for both indoor and outdoor use. Providing screen sizes that put your smart TV to shame at a fraction of the price you’ll spend on even the most affordable models, many of them include Google Assistant voice command control alongside auto instant setup tech to have you up and running in no time. Scope out the deals below: After dishing out its official 18-page Black Friday Holiday Gift Guide last week, Razer has now kicked off its main Black Friday 2024 sale event with huge savings of up to 60%. The brand is calling it the Cyber Weekend Specials and offering a ton of fresh deals on everything from gaming peripherals to big ticket items like its Blade gaming laptops. It’s even offering a “mystery Razer Swag item” with orders above $199 while stock lasts on its site. All of that and more discounted pieces of Razer gaming gear are waiting for you down below. As you likely by now, the official 2024 Google Black Friday sale is live with the best deals we have tracked on just about all of its latest Pixel gear. But for folks not bothered by the latest and greatest releases, the Pixel Watch 2 just dropped to a new Amazon all-time low as part of the retailer’s Black Friday Week Deals. You’ll now find Pixel Watch 2 in various colorways starting down at $145 shipped, or $105 under the current going rate. It is important to remember, however, that this smartwatch carried a regular price of $350 before Google officially lowered the MSRP when the Pixel Watch 3 released. The official Samsung Black Friday sale is now live with massive price drops on a huge selection of its latest tech, wearables, smartphones, and smart TVs included. You will find its latest Galaxy Watch 7 now starting down at $239.99 in the 40mm size alongside the 44mm going for $269.99 shipped, but Amazon now has those prices beat. While the band color and style options are a little bit more limited at Amazon, you’ll now find the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 starting down at $202.60 and the 44mm model starting at $247.48 shipped. Regularly $300 and $330, respectively, you’re looking at nearly $100 in savings here – more specifically over $97 and $82 off. Update: The deals below also now come along with a $90 Amazon credit!

This Black Friday offer, which is now live at Amazon, Best Buy, Target, and even Meta’s online store, applies to every frame and style of the Meta Ray-Bans including Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner starting from $239.20 shipped. This is the best deal we’ve tracked for this piece of wearable that hasn’t seen many discounts, so you might want to grab them while supplies last. Head below for more details. The official OnePlus Black Friday deals are now live and up for grabs directly from the official OnePlus site. Spanning its entire range of latest-generation tech, from the OnePlus 12 and Open foldable right through to the Watch 2R, pro-grade buds, and the OnePlus Tab 2, we are looking at some of the best prices of the year. Head below for a rundown of the exact Black Friday OnePlus deal prices – there’s up to $500 off smartphones as well as a host of freebie earbud add-ons thrown in across the lineup alongside the straight up cash markdowns here. OnePlus Black Friday smartphone deals OnePlus Watch Black Friday deals OnePlus Buds Black Friday deals OnePlus Pad Black Friday deals While we are now seeing sizable price drops on the Samsung Frame smart TVs at up to $1,300 off, the 2024 Hisense models are now also sitting at Amazon all-time lows as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. The Hisense CanvasTV delivers a very smilier picture frame-style experience as Samsung, just at a much lower price and with a display running on the Google TV platform. The 55-inch model is now on sale for $699.99 shipped and the 75-incher is going for $799.99 shipped. Regularly $1,000 and $1,300, respectively, you’re looking at 30% price drops to deliver the lowest prices we can find. Update: Amazon has now dropped prices even lower on both the single and 4-pack of the latest Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers as part of its Black Friday Week Deals. Alongside singles down at just $19.49 Prime shipped, Amazon has now knocked the 4-pack of Samsung Galaxy SmartTag 2 items trackers down to $59.48 shipped. Regularly $100, this is 38% off and the lowest price we have tracked on Amazon all-time. There were a couple fleeting Woot deals that had the 4-pack for a few bucks less than this, but are talking about a new Amazon low here that is only $3+ more than the best price ever. This is $15.50 per tracker. Update: While the Samsung site is still offering the $150 price drops below, Amazon is now undercutting those offers on the more affordable 128GB model with deals from $474.99 – this is the lowest price we have tracked to date. As part of its early access Black Friday sale that serving up the best price to date on the new Tab S10 configurations, another one of Samsung’s latest releases is hitting its lowest price to date. While there are some notable trade-in options for the new, more affordable Samsung S24 FE smartphone, the straight cash deals have never been better than they are today. Amazon is still offering all-time lows starting from $574.99, but going directly to Samsung will net you an instant credit that will drop the spend down to the $499.99 all-time low on the 128GB model and the best price yet on the 256GB variant at $559.99 shipped. Details await below. The super rare deals in the Arc Black Friday sale are now live. We have already featured the offers available on the brand’s popular Bumper Cases for iPhone, and now it’s time to look at the Samsung Galaxy side of the lineup. Price drops on the brand’s popular bumper-style cases are rare at best, outside of our exclusive discounts that is, but the Black Friday deals are offering 15% off sitewide to deliver the best deals we have tracked all year. You’ll find options for the Samsung S24 Ultra as well as the previous-generation S23 and S22 Ultra models starting from just over $38 right now – click this link and hit up the pull-down menu in the top left corner to find the Galaxy models (final discounted prices appear in the cart). Head below for more details. As part of its now live early access Black Friday deals, Samsung is offering up to $1,300 in savings on its latest model The Frame smart TVs. While several models and sizes are now either matching or slightly below our previous mentions directly from Samsung, you’ll also want to double check with Amazon as it is now doing its usual thing, slightly undercutting the direct prices by a few bucks on several sizes. Pricing kicks off from $550 shipped today (or $548 over at Amazon) and you can head below to scope out the deals across the various sizes of the 2024 Samsung The Frame lineup. As a part of its now live Black Friday sale, Samsung is offering its Galaxy Chromebook Plus in Neptune Blue for $599.99 shipped. That’s $100 off a brand new Chromebook that debuted last month carrying a $700 price tag. Today’s deal lands the first discount for this Chromebook Plus machine, marking a new low price to beat. It comes with all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern Chromebook out there, and you can learn more about it below. Samsung is now offering the best prices we have tracked to date on its brand new Tab S10 Ultra and Plus model tablets at up to $230 off before trade-ins. While we have featured some elevated trade-in values alongside some instant Samsung credit without trades, there’re now straight up cash savings on top of all of it. The official Samsung site is now offering the Galaxy Tab S10+ starting at $849.99 shipped from the usual $1,000 sticker price as well as the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra starting at $999.99 shipped, down from the regular $1,200. That’s $150 and $200 in savings, the best straight up cash deals to date, and the lowest prices we can find anywhere, but the deals get even sweeter with bonus credits and with higher storage capacity configurations. Head below for the details.

Title: AI boom drives shares of sleepy Texas land firm up 200%
URL: https://fortune.com/2024/11/26/ai-boom-wild-west-landowner/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:12:48Z
Full Content:
The newest addition to the S&P 500 may be a relic of the Wild West, but its skyrocketing valuation is a byproduct of the AI boom. Founded in 1888, the Texas Pacific Land Corporation is a company that has just 100 employees but a market capitalization of more than $35 billion. For comparison, American Airlines, based in nearby Fort Worth, employs over 100,000 people and is worth roughly $10 billion. Texas Pacific Land Corporation, or TPL, began as a land trust but found itself sitting on “black gold” soon after oil was discovered in West Texas during the early 1900s. Recently, the company has begun exploring other ways to make money from its 873,000 acres, an area larger than Yosemite National Park. Betting that the region’s dirt-cheap natural gas will be a draw for America’s tech giants, TPL is luring renewable power projects, Bitcoin mines, and utility-scale battery production. Then there’s the possibility of data centers, which has helped TPL nearly triple its stock price in the past year. It remains to be seen whether the centers will become a fixture of the Permian Basin like oil pumps, but there’s no shortage of investor hype for companies that could capitalize on the energy boom needed to power the AI revolution. “TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers, and nobody has more land than us in West Texas,” CEO Tyler Glover said on the company’s earnings call earlier this month. The company declined to provide further comment for a Bloomberg report on its data ambitions, but Glover said on the earnings call he believes TPL is well positioned to fill the need for land and water services as artificial intelligence opportunities unfold. “If we need to buy more land to accommodate a data center, then we’ve proven that’s not hard for us to do,” he said. “I think there’s also a lot of other parts of the country that are also attractive for data centers, so we’re working hard to make TPL as attractive as possible.” The bullish sentiment around TPL’s data ambitions is unsurprising given how Big Tech’s capital expenditures train doesn’t appear to be slowing anytime soon. According to data from Bloomberg Intelligence, Google parent company Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Facebook parent Meta may spend more than a combined $200 billion next year amid the AI arms race. That means data center power demand in the U.S. could grow roughly 160% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs, accounting for nearly a tenth of the country’s energy usage. “That kind of spike in power demand hasn’t been seen in the U.S. since the early years of this century,” the bank’s report said. This has prompted plenty of concerns about carbon emissions, and investors have joined the tech giants in trying to think ahead. With Big Tech beginning to ink deals for nuclear power, the top 10 performers in the S&P 500 this year include providers like Vistra (first), GE Vernova (fourth), and Constellation Energy (ninth), per Slickcharts. Demand for natural gas, often dubbed the world’s “cleanest fossil fuel,” also seems set to surge. It’s cheapest in West Texas, where a supply glut has caused prices to turn negative at the Waha Hub near the Permian Basin dozens of times this year. Managing overproduction is not an issue for TPL, which collected almost $100 million in oil and gas royalties last quarter from the likes of Exxon Mobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips while not paying anything to operate the actual wells. It’s no wonder investors have also flocked to fellow West Texas landowner Landbridge, which has seen its shares surge more than threefold since going public in June. Landbridge’s footprint in the Permian Basin is less than a third of TPL’s, however. The latter’s stock jumped 14% on Friday after the announcement that TPL would replace Marathon Oil, which has been acquired by ConocoPhillips, in the S&P 500. (TPL’s shares have shed much of that gain early this week, with the stock falling over 10% to trade around the $1,550 mark.) On a broader level, TPL’s newfound data ambitions punctuate the company’s remarkable evolution from a land-sale vehicle created to repay bondholders following the bankruptcy of Texas and Pacific Railway Co., which unsuccessfully tried to connect East Texas and San Diego. In time, the company would trade on the New York Stock Exchange in 1927 and, thanks to its lean operations and stock repurchases, would become a favorite of a young Warren Buffett. Today, unlike the value-first thesis of the Oracle of Omaha, many of TPL’s shareholders are seeking massive growth. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How ‘Shogun’ Helped FX Find Its Footing as a Streaming Empire
URL: https://variety.com/2024/tv/features/how-shogun-helped-fx-networks-emmys-disney-1236223215/
Time Published: 2024-11-26T16:00:00Z
Full Content:
Six days before the debut of “Shōgun” last February, John Landgraf was worried about the “Endless Scroll.” Sitting with his feet propped up on a low table in his office on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, the longtime head of FX explained what he meant with his signature soft-spoken, brainy intensity. The “endless scroll” is not a talisman from “Shōgun” or an artifact of the Middle Ages but rather a symptom of our times. It refers to the never-ending stream of content that so many of us now have at our fingertips. When asked if he was worried viewers wouldn’t turn out for the most expensive production in the 30-year history of FX, Landgraf paused to think. Any butterflies he had about the show’s launch, he said finally, were wrapped up in his larger concern about the “endless scroll” effect that may be training us to have shorter and shorter attention spans. “You get 10, 15, maybe 25 seconds of somebody’s attention before they make a decision whether this is for them or not for them,” Landgraf said. “That’s the thing that I worry about most.” Related Stories VIP+ Live Nation May Need a New Strategy, Even After Its Big Summer Season South Korea's Oscar Entry '12.12: The Day' Director Kim Sung Soo on Military Coup Drama Following that thread, Landgraf fretted about the prospect that humans will gradually lose interest in the stuff that is his absolute jam: dense, novelistic, narrative storytelling as delivered via movies and TV series — like a lavish sword-and-kimono costume drama set among warring factions in 16th-century Japan. “The technologies enabled by computers and the internet are orders of magnitude bigger than almost any disruption we’ve ever seen, because they’re not just economic — they’re cognitive. They’re cultural,” Landgraf said. “They’re fundamentally transforming the way we live and the way we think and the way we learn.” This response is far removed from the typical hype and bombast that is the natural language of Hollywood executives. But Landgraf, 62, is far removed from a typical executive. “The culture that John has created at FX is very special,” says Justin Marks, who is showrunner and executive producer of “Shōgun” alongside his wife, Rachel Kondo. “You never feel like you’re working with people who are afraid of losing their jobs over one bad decision, which is incredibly rare these days.” At a time when traditional cable channels are trying to avoid extinction, Landgraf and the organization he has steered for 20 years is enjoying a resurgence that has been five years in the making. Led by the critical and commercial success of “Shōgun,” FX packed a wallop this year with a busy slate of originals including “The Bear,” “What We Do in the Shadows,” “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,” “Reservation Dogs” and the latest iterations of “American Horror Story,” “Fargo” and “Feud.” Moreover, FX’s rebound started just when its parent company, Disney, needed some good news. “Shōgun” not only paid off on Disney’s considerable investment — estimated to be around $200 million for the production of Season 1 alone — but the show’s impact in the U.S. and key overseas territories helped quiet CEO Bob Iger’s critics as Disney’s stock price slumped. FX’s banner year was the proof Iger needed to counter the argument that he’d overpaid when he bought 21st Century Fox — which included the FX cable channel — for $71 billion in 2019. “Year after year, they’ve demonstrated that they not only have a keen eye for great creativity, but they have guts,” Iger says of Landgraf and his team. “You have to be fearless and willing to take big risks.” Iger had to back up his words of praise for the FX operation with Disney dollars shortly after the Disney-Fox deal closed in March 2019. “Shōgun” had been percolating in development at FX for years. Landgraf and FX Entertainment presidents Gina Balian and Nick Grad felt the project was finally ready and that FX could make a statement with a big, ambitious production. “A guy comes into your office and says, ‘I’d like to make a limited series set hundreds of years ago, and it will be virtually all in Japanese with a Japanese cast,’” Iger recalls with a chuckle. “How do you make that bet? You end up making that bet because you bet on John and his team.” RELATED CONTENT: ‘Shōgun’ — How a Decade of False Starts, Endless Debates and a Star-Turned-Producer Made a Classic Story Relevant Again “Shōgun” was the very first project that Balian commissioned for development after joining FX from HBO in 2012. Fortuitously, the series hit the airwaves right around the time that Iger was being publicly targeted in an activist investor campaign waged by Trian Partners’ Nelson Peltz — for the second time in two years. That was not a good look for Disney, a pillar of corporate America. If “Shōgun” had fizzled, it would have put even more pressure on Disney. “It was equal parts relief and exhilaration that it worked, because we’d bet the farm on it,” Landgraf says. The creative achievement of “Shōgun” was recognized with 18 Emmy Awards in September, which propelled FX past HBO and Netflix to lead the industry in total Emmy wins for the first time. It was a crowning moment for Landgraf and his tight-knit team. “What makes FX is John’s taste, his intelligence, his profound love for artists and creators, his storytelling sense and his almost encyclopedic knowledge of TV and film,” says Dana Walden, Disney Entertainment co-chairman who oversees FX and the rest of Disney’s TV operations (other than ESPN) including global streaming. “And onto that foundation you layer in a number of excellent executives who have been together for a very long time. That’s unique in the industry right now.” Walden has been a close colleague of Landgraf ’s for 25 years. Beyond award-season bragging rights, the success of “Shogun” helped reinforce FX’s role as a content engine driving Disney’s adult streaming strategy for Hulu and Disney+. “We proved to ourselves that we can do it,” Balian says. “With all the marketing and the publicity planning and a real worldwide launch – our teams figured out how to navigate this huge system that has so much to offer in terms of support. We learned a lot about how to market and launch a show like that.” And somehow, it seems fitting that it took a series that looks back 500 years in history to help FX find its way forward. “You couldn’t make ‘Shōgun’ for anything other than a global streaming platform. You need a global audience to amortize the cost,” Landgraf says. “We proved that Disney should be making this kind of programming. But we didn’t do it without them. We made it with them, and we distributed it with them. And it worked.” For Team FX, the path to figuring out how it would settle into the Disney universe was complicated by the internal drama that seized the media giant during Bob Chapek’s short tenure as CEO from 2020 through November 2022. (Iger had stepped down as CEO in February 2020.) The post-merger integration process that began under Iger in 2019 had already been humbling for FX. The company had been accustomed to having a lot of autonomy under the Fox regime. “We went from being an actual business that we managed to essentially a cost center inside Disney’s larger organization,” Landgraf said. The radical restructuring of Disney’s network and studio operations that Chapek subsequently implemented also created a lot of internal agita and speed bumps. Iger restructured the restructuring the moment he returned to power in November of 2022. The Chapek plan “was done in good faith, but it was very challenging because it functionally separated business and creative,” Landgraf observes. “Decoupling those two things sort of pitted those disciplines a little bit against each other more than creating a cooperative environment. The reconstitution of Disney Entertainment brought us all back together again.” Amid all of the shuffling, the elevation of Dana Walden in 2022 to be the top executive running all TV might have been a catalyst for a leader of Landgraf’s stature to seek a job somewhere else. He’s been courted by many companies many times — and by his own account he’s never engaged because he’s never had a more tempting offer. He routinely expresses his gratitude for Iger’s leadership as well as for Walden and Peter Rice, the Fox veteran who held the top TV job immediately after the Disney deal but was pushed out in 2022 by Chapek. “If Dana, Peter and I hadn’t come over together, I don’t think we would have made it through all that. Obviously, at a certain point, Peter didn’t make it through. I don’t think I’d still be here without Dana,” Landgraf says. “None of this would exist without Bob [Iger]. I don’t think I’d be here without Bob – term one and term two.” Walden notes that she and Landgraf first worked closely together even before he joined FX, during the 1999-2004 period when Landgraf ran Danny DeVito’s Jersey Television banner. Jersey Television had a studio production pact with 20th Century Fox Television as Walden was climbing the ranks at that studio. “There’s an enormous amount of trust between the two of us. We’ve been there for each other for a very long time,” Walden says. “From the moment I got this job, John said, ‘I’m thrilled.’ These jobs can get a little lonely at the top. I think he feels a little less lonely in his role because he has me as a partner.” From Landgraf and Walden on down, the well established working relationships among the core executive team is a big advantage for the company, industry insiders say. Balian considers herself a newbie at the company, and she’s heading into her 13th year as a senior production and programming executive. Grad is at 22 years and counting. Marketing chief Stephanie Gibbons passed her 20-year milestone earlier this year. Communications chief John Solberg is approaching 25 years. Eric Schrier spent 22 years as a key architect of FX before moving two years ago to a senior role under Walden as president of Disney Television Studios and business operations. Continuity of management breeds strong company culture, and the culture at FX is as strong as the chrome on the motorcycles seen in “Sons of Anarchy.” “There’s just a scrappiness to the place,” says Balian during a sit-down interview with Grad and Landgraf in late October. FX signed on the air in 1994 amid a boom cycle for cable channel launches. Thanks to its humble beginnings as a ragtag cousin of the Fox broadcast network, FX had a steeper climb to becoming a contender in prestige TV contests than HBO after “The Sopranos” hit the creative communities on both coasts like a meteor. “You never counted on being given anything. You always felt you had to work for it, right?” Balian asks Grad and Landgraf. They nod. “I go back to the same analysis I’ve been doing for 22 years,” Grad says, “which is, make really original, cool shit, and the rest will sort itself out.” Iger made a visit to FX’s office on the West L.A. Fox lot days after the Disney-Fox acquisition agreement was reached in December 2017. He was already a fan of the work the company did, but he didn’t know Landgraf or anyone else there, with the exception of Grad. (Grad’s late father, MTM Television and 20th Century Fox executive Peter Grad, had been Iger’s business associate in the 1980s and ’90s.) “I walked in and said, ‘Tell me about yourselves,’” Iger recalls. “To a person, they understood the brand’s mission and what they stood for.” Iger assured the nervous staffers that he had no intention of disrupting the FX ecosystem or imposing an overly Disney-fied work environment on them. Iger has learned the importance of preserving an acquired company’s unique culture and characteristics the hard way — by enduring difficult post-merger transitions. “The culture of a company is extremely valuable and part of the value proposition in a deal,” Iger says. “You don’t create a Pixar unless you have a great culture, unless you have people who don’t stop trying to make something the best it can be. People who don’t accept mediocrity.” FX’s strength flies in the face of trends that are reshaping the industry. Americans are bailing out of linear cable TV subscriptions in favor of less expensive streamers, a steady decline that spells doom for even the most established cable channels. FX still has tentpole franchises that draw viewers to the linear channel. That’s allowed it to experiment with slightly different programming strategies for the cable channel and the FX branded show portfolio that’s showcased on Hulu in the U.S. and Disney+ in major territories outside the U.S. Walden points to the FX drama “Snowfall” as an example. During the show’s six-season run, the average age of viewers who tuned in was in the 60s. On Hulu, the average age was in the mid-30s. That’s clear evidence that making the show available on different platforms means that it reaches different viewers. Almost all of FX’s series eventually wind up airing on both linear and streaming. “We view it more as a windowing strategy versus an either/or,” Walden says. FX leaders also still eagerly embrace the concept of producing a pilot episode before making a series greenlight decision. That seems antiquated by comparison to the number of outlets that make the yea-or-nay call after reading a few sample scripts. (HBO is a notable exception.) Grad cites the FX comedy series “Atlanta” as an example of how starting out with only a pilot helped a series become what it was meant to be. As Donald Glover was crafting the show a decade ago, the star insisted that its first installment be directed by Hiro Murai, his collaborator on music videos released by Glover’s hip-hop alter ego, Childish Gambino. It was easier for FX execs to gamble on an untested TV director when the network was only paying for a pilot than to commit full-throttle to an eight- or 10-episode TV series. Pilots used to be the norm for all TV networks and studios, but that has also changed amid the rise of streaming. “If we weren’t making pilots, I don’t know if we’d make that decision on Hiro, who turned out to be one of the most talented narrative directors in the entire industry,” Grad observes. “Cutting our risk into small [financial] milestones along the way definitely allows us to be much ballsier with our choices.” Like other traditional outlets, FX has struggled to adapt to new norms for TV series production and the resulting impact on how creative talent is compensated. FX has some flexibility in dealmaking when it also serves as the studio, as it did on “Shōgun.” But the larger industry shift toward subscription business models and away from after-market sales of movies and TV shows has changed the stakes for creatives. It’s a factor behind the anger that fueled last year’s writers and actors strikes. And it’s by no means settled, the FX trio acknowledge. “Psychologically, I like to live in a world where there’s home runs,” Grad says. “I think people like to know that even if the odds are stacked against them, there’s always the chance they could make life-changing money. And the fact that’s kind of off the table now is less our problem than it is a collective industry problem.” Most of all, FX leaders pride themselves on working hand in hand with writers, producers and other creatives to find the essence of what the artist is trying to say with their work. FX doesn’t have the budget to write big checks to land starry packages. What it can offer creatives is a white-glove approach to honing the material, in an environment where the platform is handling 15 to 20 shows a year, not 150 to 200. It’s a strong selling point for a certain breed of writer, director, producer and star. “We’re like relentless editors, but we’re not relentless editors who are trying to impose our own taste or our own aesthetic on something. We’re relentless editors who say, ‘OK, let us descend into the world that you’re in. Let us help you do the thing you want to do,” Landgraf explains. “We think about what are the best possible questions we can pose to you to challenge you, to make sure that you have thought [the story] through. We want to help artists make the very, very best version of the show that they can possibly make.” Kondo, creator and executive producer of “Shōgun,” confirms that a note-taking session at FX is like none other, thanks to the skills leadership trio as well as key executives such as exec VP Kate Lambert and VP Lindsay Donohue. But it starts at the top. “It’s amazing how deeply [Landgraf] listens to you and the degree of thought that goes into everything he says. He brings in philosophy, history, literature, the Bible – you name it, he brings it all to the table,” Kondo says. “I come to every meeting with my notebook cleared. I know I’m going to get something incredibly valuable, not only to what we’re working on but, like, for my life in general and how I think about my writing.” John Landgraf knows something about human behavior. He was an anthropology major at Pitzer College. He’s been a television programming executive for most of his adult life. He’s studied the intersection of social movements and artistic and pop-culture trends. He’s fascinated by how communities are formed and how they splinter at a time when communication tools (aka the new iPhone in your pocket) are advancing at lightning speed. One indisputable result of the quickening pace of innovation is the increasing amount of global economic activity that revolves around engaging consumers in some form of media — whether a TV show or a TikTok feed or a live virtual concert staged within a Fortnite video game. Will the soft power of media eventually become the most valuable commodity of all? The global economy seems to think so. And that also really worries Landgraf, as the largest of what he calls the “trillion-dollar companies” move deeper into the business he knows best. “There’s something really strange in an economy where there are 500 companies in the S&P and seven of them account for 70% of the growth in the U.S. economy. That’s different,” he says, referring to the group of companies dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” by Wall Street: Apple, Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla. “I’m not making any value judgment on what they do or what they don’t do. But I can tell you, they’re not long-form storytelling companies,” he says. “And long-form storytelling has been very deeply at the center of American culture and American enterprise and American soft power and a whole lot of other things. And demoting it in the scheme of the communications hierarchy can have profound effects that really worry me.” The Walt Disney Co. is no mom-and-pop operation; as of Nov. 21, its market cap stood at $209 billion. But in the scheme of companies with trillion-dollar balance sheets, Disney could become a takeover target down the road. For now, however, Landgraf is glad that FX found a place in the Magic Kingdom. “Disney made a really bold choice to pivot a century-old company into streaming and the direct-to-consumer business,” he says. “And they decided that they wanted to be as excellent in general entertainment as they are in family entertainment and sports.” FX will take another swing at a big-budget event series with the reimagining of “Alien” with “Fargo” showrunner Noah Hawley. It’s slated to debut in the summer. So the pressure to deliver on a global scale begins anew. Also on the to-do list for next year is moving into new offices on the Disney studio lot in Burbank. That will be the symbolic final step in the Disney merger integration for FX’s nearly 300 staffers, who have continued to work out of leased offices on the Fox lot. There are myriad other challenges ahead. Some of them are utterly unpredictable, like the forward march of AI and technological developments that might further upend the pay-TV ecosystem. Others are as old as the Hollywood Hills. “I’ll give you an analogy,” Landgraf says. “Somebody hands you a giant bucket full of acorns, and only one of them is going to be an oak tree. And they say, ‘Pick the acorn out of this bucket that’s going to be an oak tree.’” He smiles. “You do have the ability to plant it, fertilize it, water it. But some acorns just are not going to grow into oak trees, no matter what you do with them, so you’ve got to pick the ones that have the ability to do that.” Balian and Grad take in the oak-tree analogy as Landgraf argues that the real “magic” of the entertainment business is found in the hunt for the right acorn to nurture. That heady assertion hangs in the air for a few seconds, and then each executive heads back to their office to plant some more trees. The Business of Entertainment

The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it. Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for most everyone but Nvidia Open source thrived in 2024, with AI models like LLaMA 3, Falcon, and Gemma 2 empowering developers to build without barriers. Meanwhile, proprietary overreach backfired -- HashiCorp's restrictive Terraform license spawned the popular OpenTofu fork. And while the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) sparked debate, it underscored open source's growing influence. When companies closed doors, open source opened new ones. Also: Open-source AI definition finally gets its first release candidate - and a compromise Arm processors continued their meteoric rise, led by Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite. The Mac Mini M4 made desktops portable, the M4 MacBook Pros redefined laptop performance, and the M4 iPad Pro rendered traditional laptops obsolete. Snapdragon turned Windows devices into serious contenders, leaving Intel in the dust. Arm wasn't just the future—it was the present. Also: 2 reasons why I recommend the M4 Mac Mini to everyone While X imploded, Bluesky soared. Its decentralized model, sleek interface, and user-first policies made it the social media platform of choice for anyone fleeing Musk's circus. Every time X rolled out a new policy, Bluesky gained users. By year's end, it wasn't just an alternative—it was the new standard. Also: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative Matter Protocol finally made smart homes functional by forcing Apple, Google, and Amazon to collaborate. Devices that couldn't communicate before were now seamlessly integrated, making smart home setups less of a headache. It's about time. Also: Matter 1.4 now supports more smart home devices and adds new capabilities Meta surprised everyone with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses that were lightweight, stylish, and useful. Hands-free calls and subtle AR overlays made the glasses practical, not gimmicky. For once, AR tech didn't feel embarrassing -- it felt innovative. Also: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me Apple's iPhone 16 proved you can still dominate with brute hardware force, even if your AI game is… underwhelming. The base model packed the new A18 chip, boasting a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and 8GB of RAM -- a serious performance boost that left Android rivals scrambling. The cameras? A 48MP main shooter and improved 12MP ultra-wide lens delivered stunning photos, even if the selfies still look like you. Also: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone) As we enter 2025, the tech industry remains a volatile and unpredictable landscape. The winners will continue to push boundaries, while the losers will struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape. One thing is certain: The future of tech is full of promise and peril, and the next year promises to be another thrilling ride.

Title: For Microsoft, will Trump’s antitrust and environmental views help or harm?
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3610613/for-microsoft-will-trumps-anti-trust-and-environmental-views-help-or-harm.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
I recently wrote about how President-elect Donald J. Trump’s actions on AI might affect Microsoft. This week, I’m focused on what his antitrust regulation and environmental plans — and the biggest wildcard of all, his personal vendettas — could do to the company. Trump believes that the less regulation on big business, the better. So you would expect him to put an end to antitrust suits against the tech industry. But that’s not necessarily the case. There’s no doubt that Lina Khan, the head of the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who has aggressively pursued antitrust prosecutions against tech, will be let go after Trump’s election. And many of Trump’s advisers, notably venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, would like to see tech antitrust prosecutions to stop. However, some advisers close to Trump, including Vice President-elect JD Vance, want the administration to take on Big Tech — mainly because they want to stop Meta and other social media companies from policing against misinformation, white supremacism, public-health health deceptions and election lies. Microsoft has largely been spared Khan’s prosecutions, even as the Biden administration has targeted Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon, and Apple. The one recent federal antitrust action against Microsoft by the FTC, for buying the gaming giant Activision, didn’t go well for the feds. A judge let the purchase go through, although the FTC has since appealed the case. That might make you think that Microsoft is in the clear under Trump. But The Washington Post reports the FTC will be investigating Microsoft’s cloud business for anticompetitive practices. In addition, the FTC appeal of the Activision case still stands, so that case could be revived. Trump could demand that whomever he appoints to head the FTC drop those actions. Odds are, he won’t, thanks to his main tech adviser, entrepreneur Elon Musk. His AI startup, xAI, competes directly with Microsoft, and is now valued at $50 billion after investments this spring from Andreesen and others. Musk also recently amended an antitrust suit he filed against OpenAI, adding Microsoft as a defendant. Don’t be surprised if the FTC under Trump not only follows through on Khan’s investigations of Microsoft, but also files an AI suit against the company, thanks to Musk’s influence. Trump believes climate change is a hoax. He’s vowed to tear up environmental regulations and attack green energy. His campaign slogan, “Drill, Baby, Drill,” and his close friendship with the oil industry make clear that he’ll do everything he can to increase reliance on fossil fuels and kill clean sources of electricity. He was also a booster of nuclear power during his first administration, though he wasn’t quite as enthusiastic about it on the campaign trail. Even so, the stock market price of nuclear-power-related companies jumped the day after his election, and most people expect him to be a nuclear backer. What does this have to do with Microsoft? Plenty. Microsoft has vowed to make itself carbon-negative by 2030, and Trump’s attack on green energy will make it more difficult for the company to find clean energy sources. Exacerbating Microsoft’s climate-change challenges is the fact that data centers that power AI require a tremendous amount of electricity. As I’ve noted before, Microsoft might be abandoning its promises to fight climate change because of that. And the company could also pour billions into reviving nuclear energy with a proposed deal to reopen Three Mile Island, the site of the worst nuclear power disaster in US history. Given Trump’s views about climate change and his support for AI, he’ll most likely do everything he can to give Microsoft and other AI companies all the electricity they want no matter the effect on the environment. And he’ll also likely let them go full speed ahead with nuclear power. In fact, Microsoft President Brad Smith recently said he expects Trump to cut environmental regulations to provide Microsoft with all the electricity it wants for its AI data centers. Gregory Allen, director of the Wadhwani AI Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies — he worked on AI at issues the Department of Defense during the Trump and Biden presidencies — agrees. On a call hosted by The Information, he said Trump “can invoke emergency powers and waive a lot of environmental regulations to allow people to build new nuclear and other electrical generation capacity in order to power the big data centers that folks want for these advanced AI models.” He added that he expects that to happen “pretty early in the Trump Administration.” The president-elect is driven by vendettas and grievances more than he is by policy. And when it comes to tech, he has plenty of them. In the 2020 election, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife started a foundation “to ensure that everyone can vote and every vote can be counted.” Since then, Trump threatened to investigate him and send him to jail if re-elected, saying, “We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time, he will spend the rest of his life in prison.” Zuckerberg got the message, offering accolades, saying after last summer’s assassination attempt, “Seeing Donald Trump get up after getting shot in the face and pump his fist in the air with the American flag is one of the most badass things I’ve ever seen in my life…. On some level as an American, it’s like hard to not get kind of emotional about that spirit and that fight, and I think that that’s why a lot of people like the guy.” Then there’s Amazon founder and Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos. When Trump was president, he frequently took aim at Amazon and Bezos because the Post published articles that angered Trump. He didn’t just criticize and threaten him; Trump also yanked a multi-billion-dollar cloud contract with the Defense Department from Amazon. This time around, Bezos is doing Trump’s bidding. He canceled the Post’s planned endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris even though the newspaper has endorsed candidates for president for decades. After Trump was elected, Bezos praised him, writing on X, “Big congratulations to our 45th and now 47th President on an extraordinary political comeback and decisive victory.” Those are just two of tech titans who have praised Trump even though he had targeted them. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has so far managed to avoid getting on Trump’s bad side. He hasn’t gone out of his way to praise the president-elect, either, offering Trump only a pro forma congratulation after the election. But with Musk as a Trump adviser, and what will likely be a big focus on AI in the new administration, it’s not clear whether Nadella will be able to stay out of Trump’s crosshairs. What’s also not clear is how Nadella will react if Trump threatens him — and how that might affect Microsoft’s financial future and its sense of itself as a moral company.

Title: Virtual Life Is Making Us Lonely and Unhappy. Can We Break the Cycle?
URL: https://slate.com/business/2024/11/remote-work-life-loneliness-isolation-human-doom-loop-zoom-virtual.html
Time Published: 2024-11-26T10:40:00Z
Full Content:
For a decade, my therapy appointments required a 30-minute train ride to a mid-rise medical office building in suburban Philadelphia, where I reclined on a black leather couch, grabbing the occasional Kleenex. But since 2020, I’ve simply closed my web browser (article drafts, credit card bills, LinkedIn feed), angled a 1080p camera so my therapist can’t see baskets of laundry and my kids’ stuffies, and spilled my guts. I sometimes wish I could still visit my therapist in person and even miss those train rides where I’d take stock of my week, but I have no choice but to log on: My therapist, like so many other professionals, has given up going into the office. Remote therapy has increased by a staggering 2,300 percent since 2020 and now accounts for the majority of sessions. It’s one of a number of in-person activities, such as watching a movie, taking an exercise class, or shopping for groceries, that were replaced during the COVID pandemic by their equivalents at home, in front of a screen. Five years later, the convenience, price, and time savings of remote activities have made them fixtures of postpandemic life. When I left full-time work earlier this year to go freelance, I finally landed that totally flexible schedule with no annoying bosses or co-workers. I didn’t expect that working from home would initially mean a 5-pound weight gain, and that I’d take my kids to school not just to make sure they made it to class—but to chat with other parents. It turns out that the simple obligation of going to a workplace, shop, or school every day brought positive externalities that are vanishing from our lives. There was the health benefit: Pushing a shopping cart at the grocery store or walking to and from the office parking lot meant getting in your steps. Since the pandemic, the number of trips made on foot has fallen by 20 percent. There was the social benefit: Being around others made us happier, but by virtue of spending more time at home, we now have fewer opportunities to socialize. Workplaces provided easy ways to form friendships or at least gab by the water cooler—a particularly important resource in a country where 15 percent of Americans have one close friend, if any. The advent of remote work and life has accelerated a worrisome 21st-century trend: We now spend 90 fewer minutes a week socializing face-to-face than we did in 2003. In a report released last year, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy labeled this an “epidemic of loneliness and isolation.” If Americans in the late 20th century had begun “bowling alone,” the title of Robert Putnam’s 2000 book about social decline, a quarter century later they were barely bowling at all. Given these reductions in social connection and physical activity, it’s no surprise that since the pandemic, Americans are less likely to say they feel active, productive, attractive, or in good health. “A lot of these key metrics that we track have sharply worsened,” Dan Witters, the research director of Gallup’s National Health and Well-Being Index, recently told the Boston Globe. “Americans have just not bounced back post-COVID.” Since 2020, many companies, such as DoorDash and Hulu, have capitalized on people’s tendency to spend more and more time at home. “There’s a real sort of push by these companies to ask: How do you keep people on the platform as long as you can? And how do you keep people going back?” says Steve Downs, a veteran of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who co-founded the health nonprofit Building H. “Having all these products and services that make us less social, make us sleep worse, make us eat worse, we’re not heading in a good direction.” According to Building H’s biannual index of the health influence of consumer-facing companies, the ones that rank highly are those that encourage in-person activities, such as Specialized, which manufactures bicycles, and Culdesac, a real estate company developing car-free communities. Netflix scores even lower than fast-food chains. Throughout the pandemic, the media focused on the idea of the “urban doom loop,” in which remote work would kill downtowns, triggering a downward spiral of reduced services that would cause people to leave cities. What went overlooked has turned out to be the bigger and even more consequential story: the human doom loop, a cycle in which people stop connecting in real life, reducing the quality of in-person activities and the physical realm itself, further discouraging IRL activities, and so on. Nearly five years after the pandemic, it’s not the real estate we need to worry about. It’s us. When a Whole Foods opened in my neighborhood in 2016, it featured a ground-floor café where patrons could look out toward Philly’s famed Benjamin Franklin Parkway through double-height windows. Open an hour earlier than the supermarket, the café featured elaborate pour-overs and an afternoon menu featuring wine and beer in addition to food. Although Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, it wasn’t until the pandemic that the new owner ripped out this so-called third space. Now the ground floor resembles an Amazon shipping facility: The windows are frosted and lined with refrigerator cases full of groceries bagged for delivery, while patrons queue in a busy gauntlet, cellphones with QR codes at the ready, to pick up and return Amazon packages. It’s an example of a place where the pandemic tipped the balance between the digital and in-person worlds. In the past, the digital world serviced the physical one; now it feels like the other way around. I don’t spend much time lingering at the Whole Foods these days, and how could I? There’s a bidirectional relationship underway here; the growth of online goods and services is both the symptom and cause of a disappointing physical world. Consider the cab: Over the past two decades Uber and Lyft have all but entirely replaced free-flowing taxis in most cities. Taxis were imperfect, but now the option to reserve one without a phone has been nearly eliminated—and with it the option to move through the physical world without digital mediation. We are seeing this “Uber effect” play out in almost every realm. As more people shop online, everyday retailers like hardware stores and pharmacies are disappearing, leaving many consumers with no choice. Urban density once enabled niches, such as theaters showing independent films, bookstores carrying foreign magazines, or music stores keyed into the local sound. But now that online algorithms can match people with their interests, cities are losing that function too, and turning into mere showrooms for online brands. In Philadelphia, our prime Rittenhouse Square shopping area is these days home to digital-native brands, including Brooklinen, Vuori, Alo, Warby Parker, M.M. LaFleur, Framebridge, Interior Define, and LoveSac. These stores play a role similar to Amazon drop spots: They serve the necessary human element of an online purchase and little else. As cheap online entertainment grows ever more abundant, fewer go out to a theater production or to see an exhibit in person, and more cultural institutions cut back or close. Audiences for in-person culture are dying off: Just 10.3 percent of American adults attended a musical last year, and 4.5 percent attended a play—the lowest levels ever. The country has lost 4,800 movie screens since 2020. Angie Schmitt, the author of Right of Way: Race, Class, and the Silent Epidemic of Pedestrian Deaths in America, notes that at the same time people have fewer reasons to walk around and experience their communities, they’ve also been frustrated by the rise of homelessness, drug use, and other kinds of disorder in downtowns and on public transit. “That contributes to a lack of social trust,” she says. “And if people go out and have bad experiences, they don’t want to do it again.” Even as crime rates have plummeted from their pandemic-era highs, crossing the street has gotten much more dangerous: The number of pedestrians killed by cars is 14 percent higher than it was in 2019. The pattern is clear: The more we go online, the less we show up in person. And the less we show up, the less likely our physical realm will offer experiences that can compete. The truth is that we’ve vastly underinvested in our cities for decades, and tech companies have exploited this weakness. No wonder so many people feel safer and more engaged by what’s on a screen. “We have the world’s biggest companies, smartest engineers, most innovative content creators, working overtime to figure out how to keep us on our screens,” observed the New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg, who wrote a 2018 book about the virtues of libraries, Palaces for the People. “And they’re really good at it. They have the best algorithms. They have the best graphic design. They know how to grab our attention and how to keep it. … In the face of that, it seems to me like our ability to convene people in the real world requires making a much more significant investment in physical places.” Of course, there are numerous neighborhoods in the country that offer an appealing physical realm—nearby schools with lively playgrounds for kids, curated boutiques, restaurants, modern offices, cultural venues, and health care resources. They provide lots of ways to stay physically active and to socialize in person. But neighborhoods characterized by their density of amenities, such as parts of Brooklyn, New York, or Cambridge, Massachusetts, have median home prices that routinely exceed $1 million, putting them out of reach for the vast majority of Americans. Ironically, then, the housing crisis is another thing keeping us at home. Because we’ve failed to build housing in our most amenity-rich neighborhoods and let them become too expensive, people have to live in less desirable neighborhoods without the same strong public and private investment in physical spaces. Farther from everything, residents have even less impetus to go shopping in person, attend a cultural event, or trek into work. If they have the choice, that is. In a cruel twist, the people in the most disinvested neighborhoods are the ones most likely to spend their workweeks at the jobs we once called “essential”—as security guards, health care workers, municipal employees, construction workers, and day laborers. They are the ones who rely on being able to run errands or pick up groceries and shop for necessities on their way to and from work. And as our physical infrastructure increasingly breaks down—with late, crowded buses because high-wage professionals are working remotely and reducing the farebox revenue for transit authorities, with shortened business hours for stores as brick-and-mortar retail becomes less viable, with more dangerous streets—these workers pay the price. There was a moment in 2022 when it hit Courtney Klein that something was not right. She was on a Zoom call while waiting in an Austin parking lot to pick up her daughter from gymnastics class. To keep her son from disrupting the call, she gave him a tablet to use in the back seat. Rather than sit in a car on their screens, she wished there were a casual, social place where her son could enjoy some playtime while she quickly hopped on a call (and maybe drank a latte too). Out of this desire, she created All One Thing, which she describes as “a new town square and a new third space.” For now, All One Thing is creating pop-up programming—community dinners, live music, classes for kids, and co-working for adults—in co-working spaces from Los Angeles to Asheville. Klein thinks moms can solve both the human doom loop and the urban doom loop at the same time: “There’s a billion square feet of empty office space. Moms will reimagine those spaces,” she says. It is one of a number of similar efforts. The surgeon general’s loneliness report has inspired Project Gather, a movement for Americans to cook and eat dinner together. Other initiatives were the subject of Join or Die, a 2023 documentary inspired by Robert Putnam’s work. To address the need for better social infrastructure, some cities are investing heavily in public spaces. New York has created the position of chief public realm officer to transform the streetscape, supervising permanent “streeteries,” pedestrianized plazas, and more family-friendly spaces to encourage residents to socialize, shop, eat, and exercise in person. In Paris, a public-private partnership, SEM Paris Commerces, relocates small businesses to empty storefronts, cultivating commercial strips that are far more interesting for strolling than scrolling. In Philadelphia, there’s talk of turning closed schools into multipurpose community hubs that will offer health clinics, food co-ops, even housing for teachers. Our youngest adults, Gen Z, have glorified staying at home, but that may be starting to change as that demographic enters the prime mating years of their 20s. Dating apps are now hosting in-person events, such as ice cream socials and line dancing. Run clubs have become nearly synonymous with looking for hookups. Members-only clubs have also increased in popularity. Maybe this generation, which has grown up online, has learned the hard way that you can shop, learn, exercise, stream, game, worship, and work on a screen, but you still need to connect in person to find love. Even so, these efforts are small when compared with the scale of investment coming from tech companies. Just one, Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, has been willing to lose nearly $60 billion over five years investing in the virtual-reality business. We are rushing into a future of widespread A.I., autonomous vehicles, virtual-reality headsets, and mixed-reality apps. For all the talk of moving past the pandemic, the future actually looks a lot like 2020, when so many of us were stuck inside our houses and glued to our screens. We are at the beginning of a shift from a physical, public, and social world to a more digital and private one, accompanied by the instability that attends all technological revolutions. But it’s not too late to do something about it. Thanks for signing up! You can manage your newsletter subscriptions at any time. Slate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company.

Title: Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Dominating Social Media and Venturing into AI with a Focus on Future Growth

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Wells Fargo's Best Growth Stocks: 28 Stocks With The Highest Consensus EPS Growth Estimates. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against Well Fargo's other growth stocks. With the interest rate cycle kicking off in the US, stocks that are exposed to consumer and business spending are starting to see a favorable economic outlook. The stock market has also undergone a correction following the victory of President-elect Donald Trump and the Republican Party in the 2024 US Presidential Election. This correction has seen stocks that respond favorably to lower regulations, such as traditional energy, oil stocks, and banks, rise. At the same time, others, particularly green energy stocks, have not fared so well. Consider the performance of the S&P's bank, energy, and green energy stock indexes as a brief example. Starting from the bank stock index, it has gained 8.8% since the election on November 5th (as of writing). During the same period, the flagship S&P index is up by a more modest 1.64%. Similarly, the S&P's energy stock index has also outpaced the benchmark index by gaining 4.29%. On the flip side, the green energy stock index is down by a staggering 8.9%. Naturally, with the future for several sectors uncertain, this also calls for portfolio finetuning. On this front, investment bank Wells Fargo shared insights in its recent report following the election. Analyst Austin Pickle shared that his bank believes that "it is important not to let election outcomes and emotions drive investing decisions." This is because politicians often make big policy promises during campaigns which are then watered down at the time of implementation due to "prioritization and give-and-take with Congress and the legal system." To prove that "equity returns are most heavily influenced by the economy’s long-term growth trend as well as fundamental supports that drive earnings growth," the analyst shares data about stock price performance during Democrat and Republican administrations. Two key takeaways from this are particularly noteworthy. On the qualitative front, Pickle outlines that "market turbulence has occurred during both Democrat and Republican administrations, but overall, stocks have tended to advance regardless of who is in the White House." The second takeaway is more striking and relevant since it involves money - which is, after all, the primary focus of any investor. The WF analyst points out that if an investor in 1944 had invested $1,000 in the flagship S&P index, their investment would be worth more than $7 million today provided all dividends paid were reinvested. He goes further and cites the performance of small caps, real estate, energy, and clean energy stocks following the 2016 and 2020 US presidential elections. Its data shows that from the day of the 2016 election to year-end, small-cap and energy stocks delivered roughly 10% and 2% in excess returns, respectively, to the flagship S&P. However, from the 2016 election to the 2020 election, these categories lagged the benchmark by ~30% and ~120% in relative returns. Similarly, after President Biden's victory in the 2020 election to 2020 end, clean energy stocks delivered more than 20% in relative returns. Yet, by the 2024 election, they were down roughly 110%. Consequently, the bank "urges caution" for investors who are exclusively betting on campaign promises to materialize into policy action that generates tailwinds for stocks or other assets. Shifting gears, while the tail-end of 2024 has seen the stock market driven by the election, other factors are also important to determine its performance. One factor that has been all the hype for more than a year is artificial intelligence. So far, AI-based stock returns have focused on a handful of companies. One of these is the GPU-designer whose shares are up by 736% since the start of December 2022 - or soon after OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. Between September 2023 and now, Wells Fargo uses the Gartner Hype Cycle to evaluate the sentiment surrounding AI in its report titled 'Generative AI — AI buildout continues as monetization challenges emerge.' Between then and now, the bank believes that "generative AI has likely progressed from the “peak of inflated expectations” stage in the Gartner Hype Cycle into the “trough of disillusionment” stage." This means that businesses using or looking to use AI are now balancing costs with the productivity and other benefits offered by the technology. The firm also concurs with investment bank Goldman Sachs for the fact that investor attention to AI is now broadening out to firms that will provide the infrastructure needed to build out AI facilities. We covered these trends in detail as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs’ Best Phase 2 AI Stocks: Top 24 High Conviction AI Stocks, and Wells notes that interest is now shifting to firms "building out the data-center infrastructure and supporting the need for reliable power and efficient cooling." While generative AI might be in the "trough of disillusionment," the disillusionment doesn't mean that generative AI won't generate economic value. According to Wells Fargo's research, the "overall market for generative AI could grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 49%, from $11 billion in 2020 to $1.36 trillion in 2032" and generate revenue for supportive products such as chips and networking solutions. Within the AI market, two key functionalities drive performance. These are AI training and AI inference. Both require GPUs and other data center infrastructure. The first is the 'back-office' of AI where companies prepare their models for the second feature which involves 'consumer-facing' operations of generating inferences in response to queries. In terms of revenue generation potential, training is naturally larger in 2024 and will continue to remain so for every year until 2032 since it includes building facilities to create AI software. However, Wells cites OpenAI's o1 to share that inference revenue will grow faster. o1 was the first true upgrade to GPT from OpenAI. OpenAI's data shows that the new artificial intelligence model ranks in the 89th percentile for complex coding problems and improves performance on the LSAT and MATH Benchmark by more than 20 percentage points. The strong performance requires significantly more computing power for inferences, and it underscores the faster growth rate for this portion of the AI market. According to WF's research, the training market can sit at $471 billion in 2032 while the inference market could touch $169 billion. While this potential is all well and good, it represents only a part of the AI debate and does not cover all of the risks. Most AI use cases right now are limited to the business world through enterprise and cloud computing. For the everyday consumer, AI use cases at the 'edge' are relevant. These include smartphones and laptops and are a major reason why the firm behind the iPhone has seen its shares rise by 16.5% since WWDC 2024 when it unveiled Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence is one of the first across-the-board edge AI use services, and as per WF, there is "more evidence of generative AI moving to the edge, meaning that generative AI models are being deployed directly onto local edge-computing devices (such as PCs and smartphones) that allow devices to process data locally instead of relying on the cloud." This evidence could also drive a new PC replacement cycle in 2025, believes the bank. Yet, at the same time, the bank is also cautious. It notes that while AI has the potential to proliferate across a wide range of industries ranging from healthcare to retail, there is a need for caution as well since investors often heavily invest in emerging technologies before the technologies can fully deliver. Our Methodology To make our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks, we used the bank's recent Growth List, ranked the stocks by the consensus long-term EPS growth estimate, and picked those with 7% or higher growth. Wells selected the stocks by focusing on firms with a market cap greater than $1.5 billion, annual revenue of $500 million or more, and a forward EPS CAGR of 5% or more. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Consensus Long-Term EPS Growth Estimate: 20% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 219 Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the leading social media company in the world. The firm operates through Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, and courtesy of Facebook, it can boast about having 3.2 billion users under its wing. These users also form the backbone of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s hypothesis as they allow the firm to have bargaining power with advertisers. Advertisement revenue is key for the firm as it accounted for 96% of its revenue during H1 2024. As a result, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) depends on broader economic health for its revenue as advertisers spend more in a robust economy. Its dominance in the social media industry has allowed the firm to establish a fortress balance sheet as is evident from $43.9 billion in cash. These resources, in turn, have enabled Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) to gain a strong foothold in the AI industry courtesy of its investment in training infrastructure and the Llama foundational AI model. As a result, the firm's hypothesis also depends on its ability to generate profit from its AI investments. On this front, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) offers AI marketing services to advertisers to streamline their operations. Polen Capital mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q2 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said: “Meta Platforms delivered robust results in the period, with revenue growth accelerating in the first quarter. However, revenue comparisons for Meta will become more difficult from here, and its guidance for 2Q revenue fell below market expectations. After the company’s “year of efficiency,” where it cut costs in its core business, management is now indicating another ramp-up in GenAI and metaverse spending, spurring concerns about future profit margins. Metaverse spending, by our calculations, is now over $20 billion per year with little to no expected return on the foreseeable horizon.” Overall META ranks 11th on our list of Wells Fargo's best growth stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The year 2024 delivered all the drama technology fans could want: AI dominance, chip wars, smart devices that were anything but, and a social media implosion that's already a case study in corporate mismanagement. From monumental wins to jaw-dropping failures, here's the definitive breakdown of the year's tech highs and lows. Also: The best Black Friday deals live now Elon Musk spent 2024 doubling down on the chaos that turned X into a punchline. Advertisers fled after baffling policy shifts, verified checkmarks became meaningless, and users abandoned ship for Bluesky and Mastodon in droves. Engagement plummeted, and what was once a cultural institution became a meme of its former self. Musk might still call it "the town square," but in 2024, X was more like the local landfill. Also: I tried replacing Twitter with Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon: Here's what I found Amazon's five-day return-to-office mandate alienated employees, sparked accusations of "quiet firing," and triggered a mass exodus of talent. Workers who couldn't -- or wouldn't -- move closer to offices were forced out, and with them went years of expertise and innovation. This was the HR equivalent of smashing a robot with a sledgehammer for a company obsessed with efficiency. Quiet quitting? More like loud mismanagement. Also: 82% of leaders plan to increase flexible work options in the next two years Tesla's Cybertruck finally hit the road in 2024 -- and immediately rolled into a ditch. Recalls for defective inverters, cameras that didn't work, and windshield wipers that couldn't handle drizzle made the truck a laughingstock. Its resale value tanked, and its polarizing design still looked like a failed geometry assignment. Sure, it turns heads, but only because people can't believe it exists. Apple's Vision Pro wowed in demos and dazzled on paper, but in practice, it was a solution in search of a problem. At $3,500, it was more curiosity than game-changer, with no killer app to justify the cost. Apple fans drooled, but most consumers shrugged. A technological marvel? Yes. A must-have device? Not even close. Also: Apple to counter new Meta products with its own cheaper headset In 2024, Intel continued to drift further into irrelevance. Its "AI PCs" barely moved the needle, and the 13th and 14th Gen Core processors -- repackaged versions of last year's chips -- left consumers unimpressed. Meanwhile, Arm-based chips like Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite set new benchmarks for performance and efficiency. Intel used to lead the charge; now it's trailing behind, yelling at the clouds. Also: The fall of Intel: How gen AI helped dethrone a giant and transform computing as we know it CrowdStrike had one job: keep systems secure. Instead, it botched a software update that caused a global IT outage, affecting millions of Windows devices and denting its reputation. For a company built on trust, this colossal failure had customers second-guessing their investments. Cybersecurity giant? More like cybersecurity headache. Also: What caused the great CrowdStrike-Windows meltdown? History has the answer The Rabbit R1 and Humane AI Pin proved that just because you can make something "smart" doesn't mean you should. The Rabbit R1 was clunky, impractical, and destined for the junk drawer, while the Humane AI Pin overheated, lacked features, and came with a ridiculous price tag. AI wearables promised innovation but delivered irrelevance. Also: Humane Ai Pin: What went wrong and how it can be fixed (before it's too late) Sonos hit a new low with a buggy app update that frustrated customers and delayed hardware launches. Employee warnings about the rollout were ignored, leading to a $30 million fiasco, a 25% stock drop, and layoffs. For a company synonymous with high-quality sound, 2024 was a tone-deaf performance. Also: Sonos is failing and millions of devices could become e-waste - why open-source audio is our only hope 2024 was the year AI started earning its buzz. Google's rebranding of Bard to Gemini came with the release of Gemma 2 models, which gave developers powerful tools and helped Google claw its way back into the AI race. OpenAI's GPT series remained the gold standard, tackling everything from legal briefs to code fixes, while Adobe's Firefly turned non-designers into creative pros. For once, the AI hype didn't feel overblown. Also: AI isn't hitting a wall, it's just getting too smart for benchmarks, says Anthropic NVIDIA dominated 2024, selling out its Blackwell chips for 2025 before the year even ended. The company raked in $35.1 billion in quarterly revenue, a 94% jump, and pocketed $19.3 billion in profit. It also launched Fugatto, an AI tool for generating and remixing audio, and kicked Intel out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. NVIDIA didn't just win 2024; it owned it. Also: Today's AI ecosystem is unsustainable for most everyone but Nvidia Open source thrived in 2024, with AI models like LLaMA 3, Falcon, and Gemma 2 empowering developers to build without barriers. Meanwhile, proprietary overreach backfired -- HashiCorp's restrictive Terraform license spawned the popular OpenTofu fork. And while the Open Source AI Definition (OSAID) sparked debate, it underscored open source's growing influence. When companies closed doors, open source opened new ones. Also: Open-source AI definition finally gets its first release candidate - and a compromise Arm processors continued their meteoric rise, led by Apple's M4 and Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite. The Mac Mini M4 made desktops portable, the M4 MacBook Pros redefined laptop performance, and the M4 iPad Pro rendered traditional laptops obsolete. Snapdragon turned Windows devices into serious contenders, leaving Intel in the dust. Arm wasn't just the future—it was the present. Also: 2 reasons why I recommend the M4 Mac Mini to everyone While X imploded, Bluesky soared. Its decentralized model, sleek interface, and user-first policies made it the social media platform of choice for anyone fleeing Musk's circus. Every time X rolled out a new policy, Bluesky gained users. By year's end, it wasn't just an alternative—it was the new standard. Also: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative Matter Protocol finally made smart homes functional by forcing Apple, Google, and Amazon to collaborate. Devices that couldn't communicate before were now seamlessly integrated, making smart home setups less of a headache. It's about time. Also: Matter 1.4 now supports more smart home devices and adds new capabilities Meta surprised everyone with Ray-Ban Smart Glasses that were lightweight, stylish, and useful. Hands-free calls and subtle AR overlays made the glasses practical, not gimmicky. For once, AR tech didn't feel embarrassing -- it felt innovative. Also: I tested Meta's transparent Ray-Ban smart glasses, and they're a near-perfect accessory for me Apple's iPhone 16 proved you can still dominate with brute hardware force, even if your AI game is… underwhelming. The base model packed the new A18 chip, boasting a 6-core CPU, 5-core GPU, and 8GB of RAM -- a serious performance boost that left Android rivals scrambling. The cameras? A 48MP main shooter and improved 12MP ultra-wide lens delivered stunning photos, even if the selfies still look like you. Also: Why I'm recommending the standard iPhone 16 over the Pro this year (and I'm not alone) As we enter 2025, the tech industry remains a volatile and unpredictable landscape. The winners will continue to push boundaries, while the losers will struggle to adapt to the rapidly changing technological landscape. One thing is certain: The future of tech is full of promise and peril, and the next year promises to be another thrilling ride.

Video podcast Audio I don’t think I know any human being on the planet who doesn’t want to be rich, or tries to increase their worth their net worth etc. Doesn’t matter if you’re an investor, work for a charity, a church etc. Money and capital are critical, it is like our economic life blood. For example, maybe you should think about blood. Blood is a critical and essential. Nobody could survive or thrive without blood. Now imagine… That somebody is taking your help four-year-old child, in drawing a pint of blood from them a day. What is going to happen to the health of your kid? It will severely stunt his growth, or positively kill him. Another thing… Imagine like you’re eating only rancid food your whole life, and the theory, you’re not going to die from it, but… Ain’t nobody want to eat rancid food. Or, let us assume that you’re consuming certain foods to just keep you alive, like beans, but everyone knows that beans cause flatulence, even an ancient Roman times, and technically raw beans are toxic. Lagoons, naturally do not want to be eaten or consumed. And therefore the toxic shell membrane they create is probably to ward off predators. ￼ And we clever humans, devised of ingenious ways to boil the shit out of them, just simply make them edible and not kill us. And the truth is, if you only ate beans you would not die, but… If you want to be the most demigod of them all, obviously you’re not going to be some sort of poverty person just consuming beans for some sort of strange higher altruistic purpose? Instead, you feast on the finest the bone marrow, the finest lamb ribs, just think about the hut of Achilles, what did he eat, and feed his guests? You know how they talk about life before Jesus life after Jesus, BC and AD… I am quite certain that a similar concept will happen with Satoshi. Like before Satoshi, life BS (before Satoshi, haha sounds like BS), and life AFTER Satoshi (AS). ￼ so the issue with being a modern day human or even American is that so much of the economic policies are obfuscated from the general public. For example. When I was in Saigon, in Vietnam off the grid, I had some time to critically think about economic theory and the like, to really try to critically understand on how currency is printed, made dominant around the planet, supported by US military force etc. In fact, if you think about the whole American the US military complex, it is basically focused on pumping money into the military industry, in order to assert military dominance on the planet, so all the weaker nations will have to force to use our dollars and accept and use our dollars, And also… America being able to pile on infinite debt obligations, knowing that she never intends to pay any of it back. So if we think about that, we know about debt in context of just being a normal human being, we don’t really know and understand debt in terms of an American national policy. For example, as a human being there’s a certain point in which numbers don’t really mean anything anymore. For example, I told you that the American national debt was 900 trillion, 45 trillion, $10 trillion, $18.3 trillion, would you be able to really understand or grasp this? Of course no! We daily humans, assume that you’re making like I don’t know 40,000 60,000, $80,000 a year… Which means maybe let us say that after taxes you’re pulling in like five to $6000 a month. If this is the case, the law of large numbers; at a certain point certain numbers don’t really mean anything to us, nor are they connected to reality. For example, the average American has never seen $1 million in their checking account or their bank balance, let alone 10 million, 100 million, 1 billion, 10 billion, 100 billion etc. ￼ There is a certain point in which numbers, ones and zeros, don’t really register in our brains. I always make the joke that I’m an Asian who is really really bad at math. And even now I am. And ironically enough, out of all my friends or typical normal human beings I know, besides Elon Musk and Michael Saylor, I am like by far the most successful innovator entrepreneur and investor of all time. I know no other human in the flesh who has stacked as many bitcoins as I have, and pretty much for the most part I never had to ever or I never panic sold any of my bitcoin. Besides selling some bitcoin like three years ago to just max out my Roth IRA contribution for the year, which ultimately I guess was a good idea because that money went into microstrategy MSTR, which is growing at an alarming rate, ￼– fortunately I had the wisdom of Odysseus; covering my ears and eyes with digital beeswax. ￼ About it, in hindsight, maybe one of the most interesting things I did was quit email in the year 2017. I might check my email like every six months or so for like authentication codes to sign into random portals, but besides this, I no longer really use email as a form of communication. If I’m doing like a workshop and I need to communicate some sort of critical information, ￼ then I’ll just copy and paste a bunch of emails, linked to Google sheets or something to send out a Zoom link or something. But besides this, email is really kind of a not good form of communication. Let us consider, i’m almost starting to feel like sending emails like sending a fax in the year 2024. I actually find it 1 trillion times more better to just FaceTime people as needed, — just think about it… All these sci-fi movies in the past, when they communicate with some sort of computer or AI, how do they do it? When you’re chatting with Jarvis it is all just a voice, and then you do the 3-D hologram thing with your hands like Tony Stark. Or if you’re Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, what do you do? You talk to Jarvis naturally, when Jarvis is inside your helmet. In fact, I believe that the original Iron Man might be one of the best films of all time, I intend on watching it again. Anyways, once again, there is no exciting movie which is actually about somebody taking out a phone like an iPhone and either sending you a text message quietly, and or, sending a long tedious email? This will not make a fun movie. Anyways, as a consequence, I think the best concept is thinking about information information flows more critically, harder stronger faster. But knowing how to filter it. The first idea is Twitter and X. It might be the world‘s newest most valuable and only useful social media platform, now that Elon Musk runs the show, and I’m like 1000% Elon, it is really truly the best and only place to get critical information about financial news etc. My thought is traditional news outlets will die a slow gradual death, just like blockbuster. It’s funny, because I remember when I was in college, and I already saw my roommate Kevin ordering Netflix DVDs in the mail, which at the time I thought was very bizarre, but I knew that blockbuster was on the way out. I wanted to short blockbuster, but eventually did not because I just didn’t know how to do it, even now I’m not quite sure how to short a stock, it just seems too complicated. ERIC Semmler, one of the head honchos at semler scientific, is also on the bitcoin standard, using bitcoin yield, BTC yield as a measure of positive performance. Funny enough he also shares my name. Anyways, I listen to an interview between him and Natalie Brunel, and something was interesting was ERIC who has been in the game for a long time, the century said that shorting stocks is actually really really difficult and very rarely profitable. Rather a lot better to instead, to just go along in a positive way for a stock. And also I agree from a philosophical perspective, voting on the success of something, and voting on the success of a stocking company, to me almost morally an ethically feels superior; the reason being is that it just feels more positive and constructive. And also it might be more profitable? Investing in bitcoin is kinda good for everybody, even if you’re like kind of anti-establishment, anti-capitalism… Bitcoin is a positively good thing. Why? If you invest in bitcoin and you purchase bitcoin, and you put yourself in your family on a bitcoin standard, the upside and positivity is that You are essentially giving a middle finger to the establishment, the “man”. For example, anybody who is a non-conformist, punk rock, into rapper hip-hop culture whatever… Steve Jobs follower, etc., should be for bitcoin. Why? Because once again, it is anti-mainstream! Even now, bitcoin is pretty much mainstream now. Whenever you check any of the news channels, what is the best news all the time, all day every day? Bitcoin! It is the only interesting news which is happening on the planet, and will always be the best news of all time. In fact, my thought is ultimate new most important media people personalities etc. will be essentially people who work in TV Cinema media rappers podcast musicians bloggers vloggers thought leaders who philosophies and create content about bitcoin. First, Bitcoin is like the new iPhone. ￼ except the upside is that instead of every six months or a year or a year and a half, bitcoin is getting updated, all day, every day, every minute on the planet. So for example, with the iPhone and Apple… All these Fan boys just jerking off to Apple rumor news, waiting for the next next next next big thing to come out that will totally change and revolutionized their lives creativity etc. But, come on guys, we’re all technologists here and digital natives– don’t we already know that the solution is staring in our face, bitcoin? If you’re the type of person like you always want the newest iPhone Pro, Tesla, cyber truck, iPad Pro etc., isn’t also the same ethos be that you should always want the newest monetary technology which is bitcoin? Once again, very bizarre. Let us say you work at Apple Amazon Facebook Google Meta etc.… And your program or a software engineer, a developer, or somebody who works “tech”– is there any irrational reason you should be anti-bitcoin? No! I would say maybe the only negative downside is if you work in tech and you are a lemming. Even now Reddit is dead; if you’re still on Reddit, you’re not it. ￼ Also, maybe the issue here is that you’re kind of old enough now, and you’re kind of mildly successful, but maybe the issue here is that too much of your net worth is tied into your company dog? Just sell it guys, buy bitcoin instead, And or just buy micro strategy MSTR stock instead. It doesn’t matter if you’re being paid like $10 million a year at Apple Amazon Google Facebook, nobody actually wants to be there. Maybe besides Tim Cook? Let us consider, all of the innovators have left Apple. Jony Ive, and some people that I know who was in the head of the Apple Photos team. The only ones who have stayed at the big companies is that maybe, they’re stuck in a rut, maybe they have a mortgage to pay or something. If you do the maths a mortgage is actually insanely expensive like 10,000 or $11,000 a month? To even pour more money into a sink sink hole, which has true negative yield? A very very bad idea. It’s almost like it’s super cold outside, and you want to warm up by taking a nice hot bath. Can you turn on the bathwater, and you put up the plug, but, you kind of either leave the drain plug unplugged like halfway, or, You have it totally unplugged. So even if the water faucet is strong and the water is flowing into your tub at a quick rate, the rate in which the water goes down the drain might either be equal or lower than your input of water. So maybe the same thing with income, like inflow, or like flowing hot water. Assuming you want a nice hot tub of water, you want to drain the plug, stop the plug, stop it up 100%, and you want the hot water to rise and fill! Maybe we should think about the same thing with investing, and money leverage, Stop the water loss! We lose it when we have a mortgage on the home, and even a more pernicious thought; property taxes. Like let us say you buy that $2 million home in all cash, you’re still gonna be paying like 2500 or $2600 a month and adjust property taxes, which almost like attaching a leech to yourself which no matter what, the leech just sucks the blood out of you with no benefit to you. Now I am all for taxes, taxes are good. Yet, because I’ve just rented my whole life, property ownership home ownership even owning a single-family home seems like such a scam; you buy the lot for like $1.1 million, you add an ADU additional dwelling unit in the back for like $350,000, and then you try to flip it for like $200,000 More? Isn’t it just way easier to just buy bitcoin instead? The big reason is the cost to capital; all the headache and time to find the contractor to build the house, fix it up, renovate it, dealing with permits and all these headaches; and also your time cost to capital; so much time and headache and communication back-and-forth, is not really worth it. ￼ At this point because I’m dumb rich, to me the finances and the money aspect doesn’t really bother me, more of my concern and fear and dread is about having to deal with some sort of degenerate contractor, who buy the laws of physics and entropy will always be Late, more expensive, and will probably take one or two years longer than you expect. If you plan on doing the home thing, maybe the best idea is just approach things as if you will never hire help or a contractor? Then this way it could become more of a creative endeavor, and also, you know that you will never blame anyone else but yourself? Even like changing your own oil, the virtues of changing your own oil is pretty funny; I hate feeling ripped off, and I always feel super stupid for paying somebody else to change my oil. Even though it’s a huge pain in the butt for me to do it myself, I just have like 1 trillion times more joy and pride that I changed my own oil in my 2010 Prius, With mobile 1 full synthetic, and a K&N performance oil filter. It’s funny when I drive, I always have a huge grin and sense of pride on my face because I knew that I changed my own oil, 1 trillion more times happiness than even maybe driving a cyber truck or a Lamborghini? Nobody cares about your four bitcoin Ferrari; Once again, what I find so disruptive is that now… You will feel more joy pride and happiness to own the bitcoin, because you will always remember the number in your head in your mind, and you’ll always smile when you see the price exploding, rather than being stuck in a Diluted asset, whether does that be your yacht, Ferrari or Lamborghini. Or even your Porsche. If you really want to be happy, the optimal strategy assuming that you like own more than one car, or you don’t really need some sort of expensive performance vehicle that guzzles 91 octane gas, then I think optimal strategies to sell the extra car, and just buy bitcoin! In fact, if your goal is to actually make more money to upgrade to the next car, a funny strategy then is to just invest in bitcoin, write it up, make a shit load of money, and then just sell some of it later, to buy your next car. I’m super excited, the first time ever, I’m doing a free online open source zoom workshop, and don’t worry I will record it and post it later and share it with you because I feel like this is my new ethical imperative. I’m going to do it December 14, Saturday 10am to noon, Pacific time LA TIME. ￼ to register for the workshop to get the Zoom link, just fill out your email informed here, and before the workshop date, maybe like a day prior or so, I’ll email you with a Zoom link. FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here. Essentially my vision is I just want to do a soft introduction to bitcoin the philosophy of it etc., the first hour hour and a half will just be like introductions and my lecture, and then I will leave some time at the end for questions and answers. It might go a bit over but whatever.￼ ￼￼￼ It will be totally 100% open and free, and also open source, so feel free to send the link to your friends, your mom or your dad who doesn’t really understand bitcoin, also I am fluent in Korean and Vietnamese, and also Spanish if you have some sort of bilingual parents you want to bring along. ￼> FREE BITCOIN WORKSHOP REGISTRATION FORM You could also see some more details here.

Title: Bitcoin Buying Plans Are Supercharging Stocks. Is This a Michael Saylor Redux — or Another 'Long Island Iced Tea' Fad?

What does the ragtag group including a fitness equipment maker, biopharmaceutical company and producer of battery materials have in common? Bitcoin, of course. As the cryptocurrency skyrockets to unheard-of levels this month, at least 12 publicly traded companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto announced they plan to buy bitcoin (BTC), choosing it as a modern — and, lately, quite profitable — place to park spare cash. It's a path illuminated by Michael Saylor's laser eyes since 2020, when he began converting his sleepy software maker MicroStrategy into a corporate vault for bitcoin. That's turned MicroStrategy into a massive stock market success — up roughly 30 times in value since Saylor began buying bitcoin for the company, amassing a massive stockpile now worth about $38 billion. Just this month, its shares have nearly doubled in price since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president after pledging to embrace crypto. (Other crypto stocks have jumped, too. Coinbase, the exchange operator, is up nearly 70% since the day before the election.) Others are trying to duplicate that success. On Friday, a biotech company, Anixa Biosciences (ANIX), said its board of directors approved buying an undisclosed amount of bitcoin to diversify the company's treasury reserves. The stock rallied as much as 19% but settled for a 5% advance by the end of the day. Meanwhile, on Thursday, fitness equipment company Interactive Strength (TRNR) said it plans to buy up to $5 million of bitcoin after its board approved the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. Following the announcement, its stock soared more than 80% at one point before settling for "only" a full-day gain of 11%. Earlier last week, biopharma company Hoth Therapeutics (HOTH) announced a $1 million bitcoin buying plan, triggering an up to 25% surge in its stock — though nearly the entire rally fizzled by the end of the day. Similarly, companies including LQR House (LQR), Cosmos Health (COSM), Nano Labs (NA), Gaxos (GXAI), Solidion Technology (STI) and Genius Group (GNS) saw momentary spikes in their stock prices after revealing bitcoin treasury plans in November. Only one company fell after its announcement: Acurx Pharma (ACXP). "The recent bitcoin boom, coupled with MicroStrategy's 500+% stock surge in 2024, has inspired a wave of companies — particularly microcaps — to announce bitcoin buying strategies," said Youwei Yang, chief economist at BIT Mining (BTCM). Whether these newcomers to the Saylor playbook will ever see Saylor-like benefits remains a very open question. "This behavior could end the same way [as previous bull markets]: unsustainable hype followed by sharp corrections as the market realizes many of these announcements lack substance," Yang said. And whether the recent entrants ever follow through is also technically unknown. So far, only artificial intelligence firm Genius Group is known to have actually bought any bitcoin. But who can blame them for trying? Investors who invested early in MicroStrategy are getting ridiculously rich, and even recent investors are making easy money. Saylor largely funds MicroStrategy's bitcoin purchases with money raised from stock and debt sales. The copycats might gain access to capital markets that they wouldn't otherwise have had. Traders are following the old adage, "Never fight the tape" — meaning follow the market's direction no matter the fundamentals, while companies are providing what the market wants. Nobody wants to be "that" person or company telling their bosses, shareholders or anybody else that they underperformed the market because they didn't follow MicroStrategy's footsteps. "Only a few years ago, it was almost too risky to buy bitcoin. Now, however, the risk increasingly seems to be the opposite — not buying is actually the risk," said Brian D. Evans, the CEO and founder of BDE Ventures, adding that "there’s real pain in not having exposure." To the hopefuls, this sudden corporate scramble might be a sign that mainstream bitcoin adoption is finally arriving, especially in an environment where President-elect Trump has said he wants the U.S. government to stockpile bitcoin, too. "For BTC proponents, the expectation is that a combination of macro factors such as inflation and new-found regulatory friendliness will spur further examples of the asset being placed on corporate balance sheets," Toronto-based crypto platform FRNT Financial said in a report. Also, a bitcoin buying strategy could open up capital markets for companies, like it did for MicroStrategy and miner MARA Digital (MARA). Both were able to raise money recently through convertible debt that pays no interest to investors, meaning those investors are willing to forego current income in exchange for the ability to eventually convert the debt to equity, thus gaining bitcoin exposure. Saying they plan to buy bitcoin "is a useful way for companies to raise capital, not unlike the way MicroStrategy has done over the last few years," said BDE's Evans. However, to cynical ears, it all sounds a bit like the passing fad in the late 2010s that involved companies that previously had nothing to do with crypto adding the word "Blockchain" to their corporate name. The most famous example of this was little-known beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea renaming itself Long Blockchain, with an explosive result, at least initially: Its share price nearly tripled in a single day after the crypto-rechristening. The gains didn't stick and the stock was later delisted by Nasdaq. (And three people were accused of insider trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.) There have been other magic words. In the 2021 crypto bull market, big-name companies touted their Web3, metaverse and non-fungible token (NFT) initiatives — trying to hitch their shares to crypto and related hype. Facebook even changed its name to Meta to focus on the metaverse business, which subsequently faced massive losses. Meanwhile, companies with languishing share prices and no connection to crypto dipped their toes into bitcoin mining, a then extremely profitable business. The brutal bear market that followed turned crypto terminology into dirty words that few wanted to use. Though MicroStrategy has been able to raise billions from capital markets to fund bitcoin purchases, such a strategy, if pursued by others, could backfire for smaller companies, said Yang. "For microcaps, it risks being seen as a short-term gimmick, deterring serious investors. If bitcoin's price stabilizes or declines, the stocks' speculative appeal may fade, leaving these firms vulnerable to investor skepticism and regulatory scrutiny." Echoing this sentiment, David Siemer, co-founder and CEO of Wave Digital Assets, said, "While this approach may yield short-term gains in a bullish market, it carries significant risks. Unlike straightforward asset holding, leverage amplifies potential losses during market corrections, underscoring its inherent danger," he said, pointing to firms that are leveraging the hype around bitcoin to add debt to their balance sheet. Regardless of who is right, with bitcoin repeatedly smashing all-time highs after Trump's U.S. election win, magic remains in the air: Announce a Saylor-like bitcoin plan and see your stock take off. "It’s almost as though we are at a point where a lot of companies feel compelled to do this," BDE's Evans said. Welcome to the new crypto bull market.
