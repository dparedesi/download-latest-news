Title: YieldMax® ETFs Announces Weekly Distributions for Group 2 ETFs
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/24/3210286/0/en/YieldMax-ETFs-Announces-Weekly-Distributions-for-Group-2-ETFs.html

December 24, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax® ETFs today announced distributions for the YieldMax® Group 2 weekly pay ETFs. Group 2 Distribution Announcement Ex. & Record Date: December 26, 2025Payment Date: December 29, 2025 Performance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when sold or redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost and current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted above. Performance current to the most recent month-end can be obtained by calling (866) 864-3968. For the most recent STANDARDIZED AND MONTH-END PERFORMANCE, please click on the ETF ticker below: Each Fund has a limited operating history, and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gain, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. Note: CRSH, DIPS, FIAT, WNTR and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” Distributions are not guaranteed. The Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield are not indicative of future distributions, if any, on the ETFs. In particular, future distributions on any ETF may differ significantly from its Distribution Rate or 30-Day SEC Yield. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Accordingly, the Distribution Rate and 30-Day SEC Yield will change over time, and such change may be significant. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). 1 All YieldMax® ETFs shown in the table have a gross expense ratio of 0.99%.2 The Distribution Rate shown is as of close on December 23, 2025. The Distribution Rate is the annual distribution rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution, which includes option income, remained the same going forward. The Distribution Rate is calculated by annualizing an ETF’s Distribution per Share and dividing such annualized amount by the ETF’s most recent NAV. The Distribution Rate represents a single distribution from the ETF and does not represent its total return. Distributions may also include a combination of ordinary dividends, capital gains, and return of investor capital, which may decrease an ETF’s NAV and trading price over time. As a result, an investor may suffer significant losses to their investment. These Distribution Rates may be caused by unusually favorable market conditions and may not be sustainable. Such conditions may not continue to exist and there should be no expectation that this performance may be repeated in the future.3 The 30-Day SEC Yield represents net investment income, which excludes option income, earned by such ETF over the 30-Day period ending November 30, 2025, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on such ETF’s share price at the end of the 30-Day period.4 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF.5 ROC refers to Return of Capital. The ROC percentage indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information This material must be preceded or accompanied by the prospectus. For all prospectuses, click here. Tidal Investments, LLC is the adviser for all YieldMax® ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST, AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Referenced Index Risk. The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Index (or the Index ETFs). This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of companies that comprised the Index or an ETF that tracks the Index, even though it does not. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Investors in the Fund will not have the right to receive dividends or other distributions or any other rights with respect to the companies that comprise the Index but will be subject to declines in the performance of the Index. Russell 2000 Index Risks. The Index, which consists of small-cap U.S. companies, is particularly susceptible to economic changes, as these firms often have less financial resilience than larger companies. Market volatility can disproportionately affect these smaller businesses, leading to significant price swings. Additionally, these companies are often more exposed to specific industry risks and have less diverse revenue streams. They can also be more vulnerable to changes in domestic regulatory or policy environments. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA, CVNA, HOOD, BRK.B, DKNG, RBLX, RDDT, GME, HIMS, CRCL), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Indirect Investment Risk. The Index is not affiliated with the Trust, the Fund, the Adviser, or their respective affiliates and is not involved with this offering in any way. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting, and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Shorting Risk. The Fund may enter into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed (typically from a broker or other institution). If the market price of a security increases after the Fund borrows the security, the Fund will suffer a (potentially unlimited) loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. In certain cases, purchasing a security to cover a short position can itself cause the price of the security to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss. In addition, the Fund may not always be able to borrow the security at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The Fund may also take a short position synthetically through use of derivatives. Synthetic short positions, achieved through derivatives such as options, additionally expose the Fund to the inherent risks of derivatives (described above). These combined risks can result in greater losses for the Fund than those associated with direct short sales, potentially preventing the Fund from achieving its investment objective. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political events, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA, MSTR), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © websummit / Flickr Ray Dalio’s Bridgewater Associates is one of the top hedge funds today. It has over $100 billion in assets, and the fund has made solid moves despite market uncertainties. Following the steps of billionaires can help you build a portfolio that stands the test of time. However, due diligence is very important. Bridgewater Associates has made several transactions in the third quarter, and it is reflected in the 13F reports. However, the billionaire has played safe with his investments. His top holdings include two tech titans and two ETFs. Here’s why I’d recommend them too. Bridgewater Associates has the highest allocation in the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:IVV), comprising 10.62% of the portfolio. The hedge fund increased its position by 4.83% in the third quarter. Bridgewater owns more than 1 million shares of the ETF and started investing in IVV in 2010. IVV has $733 billion in assets under management. The ETF provides exposure to large-cap companies in the U.S. and tracks the performance of the S&P 500 index. IVV invests in the 500 top U.S. companies based on their market capitalization. This means its top holdings include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and Amazon. The fund has a yield of 1.04% and pays quarterly dividends. Its highest allocation lies in the technology sector at 34.36%, followed by financials (13.38%) and consumer discretionary (10.56%). IVV has a low expense ratio of 0.03% and has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 94.83% and a 5-year return of 114.12%. IVV has gained 17.09% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $687.83. The fund has the potential to outperform the broader market in the coming years. With more than two decades of history, the fund has established itself as a strong player offering broad U.S. equity exposure. Ja Crispy / Shutterstock.com Bridgewater has the second-highest position in State Street’s S&P 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), which makes up 6.69% of the total portfolio. The fund also tracks the performance of the S&P 500 and is the first exchange-traded fund listed in the United States. SPY is a low-risk investment that ensures steady capital appreciation. It has gained 17.41% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $684.83. The fund holds 503 stocks and has an expense ratio of 0.09%. It has a yield of 1.04% and has the highest allocation in the information technology sector (34.08%), followed by financials (13.55%) and consumer discretionary (10.62%). Similar to IVV, its top 10 holdings include industry stalwarts such as Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Tesla, and Meta Platforms. Despite making several buy and sell transactions, Dalio prefers to stick to some ETFs, and SPY is one of them. It can help build a strong foundation for your portfolio. The fund has generated a cumulative 3-year return of 20.43% and a 5-year return of 15.12%. With SPY, you get to own the biggest companies across industries. IVV and SPY are virtually identical in many ways. Both track the S&P 500 index and have generated similar returns over time. Prykhodov / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) forms 2.53% of Bridgewater’s portfolio and holds more than 3 million shares. While the hedge fund has trimmed its position over time, it still remains one of the top holdings. Looking at Dalio’s holdings, it shows that he’s bullish on the tech sector. Alphabet has gained 61.89% in 2025 and is exchanging hands for $308.61. It has a comprehensive AI ecosystem that ensures steady revenue growth. While the company is known for the dominating Google search engine, it has a massive empire that continues to grow. Its search engine continues to lead the industry, while YouTube has become the largest streaming platform today. Its numbers are impressive. It reported a revenue of $102.3 billion, up 16% year over year, while the net income jumped 33%. Its cloud revenue soared 34% to $15.2 billion, and Google Services revenue jumped 14% to $87.1 billion. Its cloud division has gained a multi-year deal worth $10 billion with Palo Alto Networks, aimed at expanding the AI-driven security infrastructure. There’s plenty of growth still to come. Wall Street remains bullish on the stock as its core business continues to thrive. A Wedbush analyst has an Outperform rating for the stock with a price target of $350. 2024 Getty Images / Getty Images News via Getty Images Tech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) forms 2.23% of Dalio’s portfolio. While he has trimmed his stake in the company during the third quarter, Microsoft continues to remain one of the top five holdings. The tech giant has seen a steady climb and continued optimism by Wall Street experts. AI will accelerate Microsoft’s growth, and the demand for Microsoft’s Azure cloud infrastructure has outpaced supply. There’s a lot of talk about Microsoft’s AI rollout across its entire product stack and the expansion of CoPilot in Windows. In the recently announced results, the company beat earnings and revenue expectations. It reported a revenue of $77.67 billion, up 18% year over year, and an EPS of $4.13. Its cloud segment recorded a growth of 28% with a revenue of $30.9 billion, being one of the biggest growth drivers for the business. MSFT stock has gained 15.80% year to date and is exchanging hands for $484.72. It has a dividend yield of 0.75% and has raised dividends every year since 2010. Despite the low yield, it is an excellent dividend stock to own. The company has increased its dividend by 250% in the past decade. However, the stock price has gone up; hence, the yield has dropped. Despite trimming his stake, Dalio believes in the future of Microsoft and has held the stock since 2005. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

In July 2023, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) for adults and the 9th Model List of EML for children. These lists serve as global references for essential medicines that should be universally available, accessible, and affordable. This editorial explores recent updates to the WHO EML lists, with a particular focus on medicines addressing neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). We discuss the persistent barriers to equitable access, including economic, regulatory, and logistical challenges; highlight global initiatives aimed at improving accessibility; and propose strategies to bridge the gap in essential medicine access. We emphasize the need for international collaboration, increased funding for research institutions, pharmaceutical companies, and global health initiatives to support the development of novel treatments for NTDs, and innovative distribution approaches to ensure these medications reach underserved populations.

Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Essential medicines are chosen according to a population’s health priorities. Selection is made based on disease prevalence, evidence for efficacy and safety, and cost-effectiveness—criteria established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and reaffirmed in 2024 [1,2]. These same criteria were applied to the 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) in 2023, which this editorial examines. Since its first publication in 1977, the EML has guided national medicine policies and improved the availability of life-saving medicines to all who need them [3], yet around 2 billion people globally still lack access to essential medicines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) [1–4]. Recent analyses confirm that affordability challenges remain pressing even in 2025, with essential generics still unaffordable for many households [5]. Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are ancient illnesses of poverty that impose a devastating human, social, and economic burden on over 1 billion people annually [2], primarily in tropical and subtropical regions among vulnerable, marginalized populations. Over 90% of NTDs affect LMICs, thriving in environments marked by inadequate sanitation and weak healthcare infrastructure [6]. NTDs include, but are not limited to, lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, onchocerciasis, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. Despite their significant impact, NTDs remain underfunded in both research and pharmaceutical industry investments compared to other global diseases. Although NTDs represented nearly 20% of the infectious disease burden in 2022, they still accounted for less than 0.5% of global health Research and Development (R&D) funding [7]. The 23rd Model List of Essential Medicines of the WHO (2023) is significant for its increased emphasis on infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, and the equitable medicine distribution. Nevertheless, the primary obstacles to accessing essential medicines in the LMICs remain. This editorial will highlight some of these challenges and illustrate how real-world evidence can be used to address them in the context of policymaking. Although malaria is not classified by the WHO as a NTD [8], it disproportionately affects underserved and vulnerable populations in many LMICs and faces similar barriers to equitable medicine access. Therefore, in this editorial, malaria is included in certain sections as a comparative example to highlight overlapping challenges and potential shared solutions. The WHO Model List of Essential Medicines (EML) was first introduced in 1977 to assist countries in identifying those essential and cost-effective medicines that should be made available to the population [1]. The list has become a global reference. Updated every two years, the list now informs national essential medicine policies in more than 110 countries [3]. The WHO EML criteria for selecting medicines are: The WHO EML is further divided into two lists: By serving as a global reference, the EML guides procurement, supply chain planning, and policymaking at the national level [1]. It also plays a role in supporting universal health coverage by identifying treatments that should be accessible, affordable, and available to all populations [4]. The 55 new medicines were recommended for inclusion in the 23rd WHO Model List (2023), and 9 existing drugs had their indications expanded. This update focuses on infectious diseases, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and affordability [1]. The 2023 WHO EML includes several additions and revisions that directly impact the prevention and treatment of NTDs. Primarily, the inclusion of pediatric formulations for leishmaniasis and schistosomiasis addresses long-standing gaps in child-appropriate dosing and administration, a key barrier in endemic regions [1,8]. Updated recommendations for antiparasitic medicines enhance treatment efficacy and may help mitigate resistance development [1]. Although malaria is not classified as an NTD, the addition of newer artemisinin-based combination therapies offers lessons in scaling up access to essential medicines for other diseases affecting neglected populations [8]. These updates, while important, highlight remaining gaps; for example, the absence of certain NTD treatments from the core list, limited guidance on affordable procurement mechanisms for LMICs, and the need for stronger links between the EML and national procurement systems [1,9]. The 2023 updates are consistent with the WHO’s efforts to address issues of equity in access to medicines on a global level. However, policy changes and more funding are required for real-world adoption. More than one billion people are affected by NTDs, mainly in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America [2]. These diseases hold and maintain people in the poverty cycle through long-term health impairment, disability, and reduced economic productivity. Some examples are: However, there has been less investment in research and development for NTDs than for diseases that are more common in high-income countries, resulting in the treatment gap and slow development of new treatments [6]. Approximately 2 billion people, especially in LMICs, are still faced with great challenges in obtaining the essential medicines as data shows that over 50% of public health facilities in LMICs experience regular stock-outs [10]. These barriers are a result of economic factors, policy barriers, weak health systems, and pharmaceutical industry factors [4,11]. Despite persisting challenges, global access to essential medicines did not stop improving. WHO reports that global access to essential medicines rose from 50% in 2015 to 65% in 2022 [1]. The upward trend in access demonstrates successful worldwide initiatives, but LMICs continue to face substantial access challenges. The high cost and low health care financing in LMICs is a major factor that limits the access to essential medicines for NTDs. The inability of most national health systems to afford essential medicines has led to stockouts or mimicking donor-dependent programmes [12–15]. Recent WHO reporting and 2025 analyses reaffirm that affordability gaps persist despite progress [5]. Access to medicines in LMICs is frequently hindered by regulatory and logistical barriers. Lengthy drug approval processes delay market entry, while weak procurement and distribution systems contribute to recurring stock-outs of essential medicines. Inadequate quality control and limited regulatory oversight also increase the prevalence of counterfeit or substandard products. Together, these challenges create systemic barriers that prevent timely and equitable access to essential medicines in LMICs [9,16,17]. The lack of profits in the market for NTDs removes incentives for pharmaceutical companies to conduct research and development of new treatments. This market failure can be addressed by public–private partnerships (PPPs), subsidies, and advance market commitments that reduce the financial risks and ensure demand [10]. Funding, tax incentives, and volume guarantees are some of the mechanisms that provide funding and make NTD treatments more attractive to pharmaceutical investors [18,19]. Uncertainty of demand discourages pharmaceutical companies from investing in NTD treatments. Without predictable markets, R&D for low-profit diseases remains unattractive. The financing tool known as Advanced Purchase Commitments (APCs) helps minimize financial risks that come from developing treatments for NTDs. The guaranteed market through APCs gives pharmaceutical companies the necessary certainty to conduct R&D for diseases that generate limited profits. The Global Fund together with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) has implemented APCs to promote vaccine development for malaria and rotavirus while similar models should be used for NTDs [10]. Similar models, if applied to NTDs, could help overcome this barrier and stimulate innovation [18,19] Pricing remains a fundamental barrier to equitable access for NTD medicines. Pharmaceutical companies implement tiered pricing structures which enable them to establish varying medication costs based on the income level of each purchasing nation. While the HIV/AIDS sector demonstrates successful implementation of this pricing model through antiretroviral drugs that maintain affordability for low-income nations, NTD medicines have not benefited from similar arrangements. The absence of transparent fair pricing model and mechanisms creates a barrier for LMICs that must fund NTD programs largely without donor subsidies. Without adaptation of tiered pricing to NTD medicines, affordability remains a critical obstacle to equitable access [5,12–14] Pharmaceutical companies often lack financial incentives to pursue R&D for NTDs, as these conditions primarily affect low-income populations with limited market potential. Tax credits serve as incentives that can motivate pharmaceutical companies to invest in NTD drug development. Governments could provide tax reductions to pharmaceutical companies that dedicate specific parts of their R&D funding to neglected diseases. This approach would help ease the financial burden on companies while enhancing their interest in developing treatments for NTDs. A relevant example is the Orphan Drug Tax Credit in the United States, which successfully stimulated investment in therapies for rare diseases by reducing the effective cost of development [12]. Analyses of the neglected disease R&D landscape highlight persistent financing gaps and underscore the need for targeted incentives to overcome the innovation deficit [18,19]. More recently, frameworks such as the UBC Global Access Principles have demonstrated how aligning innovation incentives with equitable access goals can further ensure that new medicines benefit populations in LMICs [20]. Adapting such tax-based incentives for NTDs could help fill critical innovation gaps and align private sector efforts with public health needs. NTDs are a subset of infectious diseases that account for 19% of global disease burden, yet they have obtained less than 0.5% of global health funding and development funding during the last decade—far less than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria [4,7]. WHO’s initiatives and rising use of real-world evidence attempt to address these deficiencies by providing new approaches to enhance the availability, affordability, and distribution of these potentially life-saving drugs. Notwithstanding these efforts and the increasing momentum in the global fight against NTDs by international health organizations, governments, pharmaceutical companies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the challenge of equitable access to essential medicines persists. WHO is central in setting up global standards as well as frameworks for action to combat NTDs. Accelerating programmatic action, increasing cross-sectoral collaboration, and strengthening country ownership are the three key strategic pillars of the WHO’s activities in this regard based on the Global Strategy for Control of Neglected Tropical Diseases (2021–2030) [21]. Some of the components are: In countries with high prevalence of certain diseases including lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and schistosomiasis, the World Health Organization has recommended preventive chemotherapy and has initiated Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaigns. In this regard, the 2021 MDA campaign covered more than 800 million people in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [1] with the assistance of the WHO. The WHO works with organizations like the Global Drug Facility and the Medicines Patent Pool to ensure the availability and affordability of essential medicines that include antimalarials, antiparasitic, and tuberculosis drugs [22]. By voluntary licensing agreements, generic competition, and pooled procurement mechanisms, these partnerships have brought down prices and improved access to medicine in LMICs. For instance, licensing of intellectual property has helped in the affordable procurement of essential medicines in LMICs, resulting in reduced costs and increased treatment coverage [23]. Other global health organizations, including Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), Gavi, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, have also been involved in financing and delivering essential medicines to WHO. DNDi has provided affordable treatments for leishmaniasis, sleeping sickness, and Chagas disease and more than 2.4 million people have benefited from the life-saving drugs [7]. Especially, the Gates Foundation has made contributions towards vaccine development Global health R&D funding and large-scale disease eradication including malaria and NTDs initiatives. New antibacterial agents and artemisinin-based combination therapies for malaria were added to the 2023 WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, and WHO continued to manifest concern towards antimicrobial stewardship [1]. These initiatives are essential but require further global investment and sustainable funding mechanisms to ensure long-term success. Recent drug approvals have focused on NTDs [24] and AMR [25]. For example, Oral Amphotericin B, which has been developed under UBC’s Global Access Principles, has been listed as a WHO priority medicine for visceral leishmaniasis owing to its cost-effectiveness, thermal stability, and safety in the LMICs [26]. Furthermore, Hancock Lab’s immunomodulatory peptides are effective in combating bacterial, viral, and fungal infections thus supporting WHO’s AMR strategy [26]. WHO functions as the primary organization that develops global strategies to combat NTDs. The effectiveness of these strategies depends heavily on how countries execute them. The National Strategic Plan for malaria elimination in India has achieved a substantial reduction in transmission by using MDA campaigns and enhancing diagnostic testing capabilities [27]. The WHO supports Uganda’s MDA program for river blindness, which has effectively decreased the disease prevalence in affected areas [21]. Brazil implemented WHO-recommended Chagas disease control measures for diagnosis treatment and vector control, which led to a decrease in new infections [15]. The WHO collaborated with Senegal to achieve near-eradication of guinea worm disease, which serves as an exemplary model for NTD control [28]. Here, we identify and highlight key policy, financial, and technological innovations that fit into global health strategies and have been endorsed by WHO [21], DNDi [29], Gavi [30], and other international organizations that can help achieve the vision of increasing access to essential medicines for NTDs. In support of and advocacy for these approaches, and consistent with the mission of NGDI, we stress the importance of more partnerships and implementation efforts. Emphasizing the development of domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing in LMICs is to address dependence on imported medicines and increase the affordability of the former. WHO recommends that countries should: While existing PPPs have played a role in NTD drug donations, expanding these collaborations requires additional measures: WHO’s 2023 Essential Medicines List has been updated to address global health needs in 2025, but significant barriers still hinder equitable access to essential medicines for NTDs. To overcome these challenges, we need stronger global and national policy interventions, more funding for R&D, and technology-based solutions. Through improved cooperation and coordination between governments, pharmaceutical companies, and international health organizations, the global health community can enhance availability of essential medicines and work towards the eradication of NTDs.

Title: Wall Street’s bid on crypto dominated 2025 but what’s the demand outlook for 2026?

Fed policy shifts and crypto-friendly regulation point to a bullish 2026, but AI risk, ETF flows and consumer stress could test demand. Cointelegraph in your social feed 2025 was a blockbuster year for Bitcoin (BTC) and the wider crypto market as crypto-friendly legislators platformed growth-focused regulation and Wall Street finally accepted Bitcoin, Ether (ETH), and numerous altcoins as a valid asset class worthy of inclusion in an investment portfolio. The global bid on Bitcoin, Ether and Solana’s SOL (SOL) token was near immeasurable, with total net flows into the spot Bitcoin ETFs reaching $57 billion and the total net assets across the ETFs reaching $114.8 billion. Going into 2026, the real question is whether the pace of institutional, corporate and government-level adoption, which were critical price drivers in 2025, will continue. Since October, the robust inflows to the spot Bitcoin ETF tapered off and, in some cases, turned into a sellers' market for weeks on end, and this was followed by a 30% correction in BTC and 50% in Ether. In an interview with Schwab Network’s Nicole Petallides, Cointelegraph head of markets Ray Salmond said that the crypto market’s performance in early 2026 will depend on a range of factors. .@Cointelegraph's Head of Markets Ray Salmond tells @NPetallides that he expects bitcoin, ethereum and solana demand in the spot and ETF markets to set the tone for the industry in 2026.For more market news, tune into: https://t.co/PYaqKPRp8C pic.twitter.com/ZCp1EIXyUh Beyond the ETF flows and demand across spot markets like Binance and Coinbase, investor sentiment regarding the immense size of the AI industry buildout and the performance of the tech-heavy S&P 500 is likely to have a direct impact on crypto markets. The AI buildout, company valuations, fundraising, IPO performance and whether datacenter hyperscalers continue to propel the equities markets alongside MAG7 will remain at the forefront of everyone’s mind. In the interview, Salmond said rapid balance sheet expansion was a strategy that supercharged tech-related equities in 2025 as hyperscalers spent double-digit billions on data centers, compute, Nvidia GPUs and energy. At some point in 2026, the expectation will be that these companies demonstrate that they can monetize their investments, or at least finance the expansions from their internal cash flow. In the latter half of 2025, Oracle, Meta and Nvidia saw their stock prices fall as the market questioned whether there was a chance that some of these companies’ free cash flow could go negative. If investors smell smoke related to debt-heavy, cash-poor AI and quantum computing companies in 2026, there’s likely to be some negative reaction. How these shockwaves carry over to the SPX, DOW, and, by proxy, crypto is something investors will need to keep on the watch list. A bullish event worth watching in the early part of 2026 will be whether or not the Clarity Act becomes law. The crypto lobby aimed to have this act passed into law before the end of the year, but the lengthy government shutdown delayed progress on hammering it out. If passed, the Clarity Act will provide clearer rules and the necessary environment for FinTech innovators to sandbox in the US, and the hope is that more offshored crypto businesses will headquarter back in the United States. It will define which regulatory bodies (SEC and CFTC) have jurisdiction over various crypto assets, depending on whether they are classified as securities or commodities. There’s also a strong emphasis on consumer protections, and a better framework in this area could provide the necessary transparency that businesses and consumers need to confidently invest in crypto assets. The Federal Reserve’s policy shift is expected to further morph into an easy money regime, and US President Donald Trump’s early 2026 Fed chair selection is anticipated to bring up to 100 basis points in rate cuts. According to Salmond, Salmond explained that “the job market is softening and this cooling trend is predicted to carry on in 2026. The ‘transitory’ impact of the Trump tariffs has resulted in elevated goods and services costs, health insurance premiums will rise, and retail investor confidence may drop as layoffs are announced, consumer debt rises and disposable income falls.” At the same time, “investors expect Fed rate cuts to result in lower mortgage rates, compel banks to loosen the purse strings for lending and lure consumers to go buy more stuff. But, the potential return of easy money policy and big government spending essentially confirms that the US is kicking the debt bomb further down the road.” Related: JPMorgan explores crypto trading for institutional clients: Report In Q1 2026, the dilemma investors will have to contend with is whether there are signals that prove that the Fed's easy money trade is being front-run and possibly sold on confirmation, or will the evolving Fed policy also reinvigorate the bull market seen across equities in 2025 and extend to crypto? Investors who prioritize optionality and a nimble footprint should be able to avoid some of the pitfalls of a narrative and speculation-driven market, where the MAG7 and AI markets could prove to be overvalued. On paper, the big picture view for 2026 is bullish, especially when considering the Trump economic mandate, Fed policy and crypto-friendly regulation, but it’s the unknown outcomes of the AI buildout and the actual impact of rate cuts on the consumer and economy that are going to determine the direction markets take in Q1 and Q2.

Title: A chaotic 'up-crash' for markets riding a turbulent 2025

Please let us know The Business Topic:Reserve Bank Of Australia Interest rates fell, inflation kept surprising and the AI billions and trillions kept flowing: world stock markets had a party. (Unsplash: Krys Amon/licence) AI. Market records. Tariffs. Penguins. TACO. It's been a big year of economic shocks and surges as the international framework of global trade was shredded. In other major news, a company famous for making gaming PC chips became the world's most valuable, and Australia's key interest rate stuttered downwards then flatlined. George Tharenou, chief economist for Australia at investment bank UBS, was in New York during April's so-called "liberation day", when US President Donald Trump revealed a sweeping regime of tariffs that stunned global markets. "It was surreal seeing the markets move to meltdown amid the uncertainty," he recalled. "This is a true bubble-like mentality, and it doesn't look like there's initially anything right now to pop it," argues UBS's George Tharenou. (ABC News: John Gunn) And there were many more shocks to come. To analyse the hits and misses of 2025, the ABC quizzed some of Australia's most prominent economists about four intertwined elements that helped to define the year. Those key events and trends: Asked to summarise 2025's economic picture, Shane Oliver, the head of investment strategy and chief economist at AMP, was succinct: "Resilience. But tell that to the penguins of the uninhabited Heard and McDonald Islands to the distant south-west of Australia — bizarrely singled out in one of the biggest developments of the year, April's US tariffs. Placing heavy tariffs on exports from islands that have no human residents or trade with the US was emblematic of the chaos unleashed when the US administration revealed expensive new costs on goods sent to the nation. "The big thing for the last year in terms of markets has just been how strong they've been," says Shane Oliver. (ABC News: Daniel Irvine) "What we saw on 'liberation day' was a sign that Donald Trump wanted to rip up the global architecture that had prevailed for much of the post-[World War II] period," Dr Oliver said. The tariffs place a cost on trade from allies, neighbours and perceived enemies alike. While staunch US allies such as Australia and the UK were hit with a 10 per cent rate, at one point, a 145 per cent tariff was going to be put on trade with China. The US defended placing tariffs on islands that lacked trade or humans, suggesting that otherwise they would become a penguin-portal of countries seeking to avoid US levies. "The idea is that there are no countries left off," US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told broadcaster CBS. Taxing penguins was just part of the slapdash nature of the levies, which would make goods imported into the US more expensive, according to Dr Oliver. The impact — as countries scrambled for deals, exceptions and new markets for their goods — was panic. Sally Auld, chief economist at NAB, said she grabbed the red pen, essentially revising down projections of US and global economic growth for 2025. But as deals were made and the application of many tariffs was paused, that frosty view thawed. NAB chief economist Sally Auld says stock markets, worldwide, are buoyant for a single reason: "The whole tech complex has really led the market higher." (ABC News: John Gunn) Australia held on the "baseline" 10 per cent tax on goods exported to the US, while countries across the globe cut deals. "It became clear that most other countries really just didn't want to fight," Ms Auld said. Betashares chief economist David Bassanese watched the initial tariff hit play out on financial markets. "Markets reacted, fearing it could tip the US economy into recession," he recalled. What came next was the so-called "TACO trade" — standing for Trump Always Chickens Out — when the negative impact of deals or ideas became known. "We didn't get a tit-for-tat escalation in the trade wars. So most countries … basically rolled over and accepted the tariffs that Donald Trump imposed on them," says David Bassanese. (ABC News: John Gunn) "We have seen that. He has scaled back the tariffs through the course of the year. He's announced some deals with countries," Mr Bassanese said. Our nation is heavily exposed to moves in global trade — particularly commodity markets that set the price for exports like iron ore and gold. But at the start of the year, a huge focus was placed on a boardroom in a temporary office in Sydney, where the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board was meeting to set interest rates. At the start of the year, anticipation of a cut to official interest rates was intense. The RBA had hiked the cash rate to 4.35 per cent in November 2023 and held it there through 2024. With around one-third of Australians servicing a mortgage — and a further third renting, many from landlords with mortgages — the public was feeling the pain of higher repayments. Consumers slashed their spending as the cost-of-living crisis kept chomping at household budgets. "There was undoubtedly a lot of tension," said independent economist Nicki Hutley. "Part of the reason [households] were doing it tough wasn't just interest rates, it was higher-than-usual inflation." "We're very tightly poised", said independent economist Nicki Hutley, between lowering inflation without risking some significant rises in the unemployment rate. (ABC News: John Gunn) By late 2022, consumer prices were rising at a rate of 7.8 per cent a year. That tempered this year, with price rises at one point slowing to 1.9 per cent, below the 2–3 per cent target range the central bank was aiming for. The RBA cut the cash rate by 0.25 percentage points in February, May and August. "The pressure was there because we could see inflation was coming down, we could see the economy was really, really sluggish," Ms Hutley said. NAB's Ms Auld said the impact of a lower cost of money was flowing through the economy, with stronger consumer spending and higher housing prices. "The challenge has been that the recovery that we've got is already starting to lessen the scope for inflation to fall," she said. Most market watchers have now changed their initial view that the RBA would cut rates further in the final months of 2025 or the start of 2026, as inflation has ticked up, once again rising above the central bank's 2–3 per cent target. Mr Tharenou has what will be an unpopular view for people with big outstanding debts — interest rates are more likely to go up than down. It's a view shared by a growing cohort of economists, and expressed by RBA governor Michele Bullock herself. "I think begrudgingly the RBA is going to shift towards raising the cash rate by the middle of next year," Mr Tharenou said. AMP has forecast rates to remain on hold through 2026, with the risk skewing towards a hike. Dr Oliver said in order for a rate cut to be back on the table, unemployment would need to rise. In the most recent data, the unemployment rate remained at 4.3 per cent in November, down from 4.4 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms in September. At the end of 2024, both the trend and seasonally adjusted measures were 4 per cent. The RBA's rate-setting board next meets on February 2 and 3. "Liberation day" might have sounded like freedom but the initial reaction of global stock markets was unrestrained panic. In New York, the S&P 500 index wiped $7.5 trillion in value in the two days after the announcement. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 22 per cent from its December 2024 record close and the Dow Jones, European indices and Australia's markets fell more than 5 per cent. "The push-pull factors in markets this year have been a) Donald Trump and tariffs, but b) the positive of the AI boom," said Betashares's Mr Bassanese. Massive investments in artificial intelligence, data centres and computer chips propelled the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech companies most exposed to the boom — Google's parent Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Facebook's parent Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The stock price of the latter has rocketed more than 1,200 per cent after its computer chips — originally powering the visuals of gaming computers — became the bedrock of an AI boom. Nvidia leapfrogged Microsoft to become the most valuable company in the world, and the first to be valued at more than $US4 trillion ($6 trillion). It's what George Tharenou of UBS describes as an "up-crash". "It's almost a detachment from fundamentals," he said. "We haven't really had a boom in the real economy, but we have had a boom in asset markets." "People call it FOMO [Fear of Missing Out]. The higher the price, the higher the demand. People just want to get into asset markets and not miss out." Despite a recent dip, the ASX 200 index of our largest companies is up close to 5 per cent year-to-date. That makes sense to Shane Oliver of AMP. "We've seen the interest rate cuts, we've seen profits, particularly in the US, continue to surprise on the upside. And even though conditions have been on the soft side [in Australia], we've avoided recession". The runaway performance of the "Magnificent Seven" has brought fears of a repeat of the late-1990s, early-2000s dot-com market crash. But there's a key difference, said NAB's Sally Auld. While the dot-com bubble and the subsequent burst were driven by hysteria around companies trading at really expensive valuations despite being "yet to turn a dollar", Ms Auld said, "that's definitely not the case this time around". Bolstering that case is the mind-melting amounts of money being spent on data centres, factories and technology to power the AI revolution. "I think that number is now close to $500 billion, which is a huge number, and really forcing people to accept that this is a new innovation cycle," she said. The capital expenditure has been so large that it has put a so-called floor under the growth of the US economy. "Somewhere between 40 to 50 per cent of [gross domestic product] growth in the first six months of this year in the US can be accounted for by that huge AI capex spend — it's helping to prop up equity markets." The potential impact remains huge. So is the risk. "We're all openly talking about the fact that there are bubbles and almost thinking that it doesn't matter, that somehow, mystically, this time will be different," economist Nicki Hutley said. George Tharenou is another who isn't convinced the gains are justified by fundamentals. "It's almost the opposite of the law of economics," says Mr Tharenou, describing this year's market behaviour.

Title: Why Nvidia maintains its moat and Gemini won’t kill OpenAI

Time Published: 2025-12-21T21:07:36Z

UPDATED 16:07 EST / DECEMBER 21 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer Two prevailing narratives have driven markets recently. The first is that Nvidia Corp.’s moat is eroding primarily thanks to graphics processing unit alternatives such as tensor processing units and other application-specific integrated circuits. The second is that Google LLC generally and its Gemini artificial intelligence model specifically is gaining share, will dominate AI search and ultimately beat OpenAI Group PBC. We believe both of these propositions are overstated and unlikely to materialize as currently envisioned by many. Specifically, our research indicates that Nvidia’s GB300 and the follow on Vera Rubin will completely reset the economics of AI, conferring continued advantage to Nvidia. Furthermore, Nvidia’s volume lead will make it the low cost producer and, by far, the most economical platform to run AI at scale – for both training and inference. As it pertains to Google, it faces, in our view, the ultimate innovator’s dilemma because its search is tightly linked to advertising revenue. If Google moves its advertising model to a chatbot-like experience, its cost to serve search queries goes up by 100 times. The alternative is to shift its business model toward a more integrated shopping experience. But this requires more than 10 blue links thrown at users. Rather, it mandates a new trust compact with its users and advertisers, which Google does not currently possess, even with Gemini’s recent success. Despite the criticisms of ChatGPT, OpenAI in our estimation is well on the way to disrupting today’s online experience by emphasizing trusted information over pushing ads. The bottom line is the two early catalyzers of the AI era, Nvidia and OpenAI remain in a strong position in our view. Though lots can change, the current narrative around these two firms is likely to change when GB300 adoption ramps. In this, our 300th Breaking Analysis, we set forth our thinking around what we believe is a misplaced narrative in the market. We’ll explain what we think the market is missing and why Nvidia’s forthcoming product lineup will reset the narrative. We’ll also look at the economics of search, large language models and chatbots and share why OpenAI, while facing many challenges (competition, commitments, uncertainty), is in a stronger position than many have posited; and why Google, though clearly a leader in AI, remains challenged to preserve what may be the greatest business in the history of the technology business. We believe the core issue with TPUs isn’t whether they’re “good” chips — they are. The issue in our view is broad-based architectural fit for the next phase of AI, where frontier-scale workloads are increasingly communication-heavy and bandwidth-hungry and require systems that can scale to very large clusters without collapsing under their own coordination overhead. In our assessment, TPUs were designed in an era when bandwidth was expensive and hard to deliver, and that design center shows up as models scale and workloads diversify. TPUs are well-suited for lower-bandwidth AI and have proven effective in production contexts such as search. They can do certain training well, and they’ve been associated with important early milestones. But as models get larger and the work becomes more distributed, our research indicates the TPU design runs into practical constraints on expansion and on the amount of bandwidth available within the architecture. In our view, that’s a key reason the TPU approach hasn’t become the broadly replicated blueprint across the industry. We believe leading frontier efforts increasingly demand an architecture optimized for high bandwidth and scale — the kind of system design that enables “GPU factories,” where very large numbers of accelerators can be connected and kept productively utilized. When we talk about the requirements for AI factories, we highlight below three key factors: In our view, architectures designed around higher-bandwidth, scalable interconnects are better aligned with those requirements. Our premise is that TPUs remain a single-vendor architecture with a topology that effectively forms pods — a tightly coupled unit presented as a single system. That approach was elegant for its time and echoed other historic designs (for example IBM Blue Gene, Cray) intended to solve the “how do we connect everything” problem. But we believe the limitations show up in two places: None of this makes TPUs irrelevant. In our opinion, TPUs remain extremely useful and attractive — particularly for more bounded workloads — but usefulness is not the same thing as being the dominant foundation for next-generation AI factories. And in our framework, it’s definitely not the platform that will erode Nvidia’s moat. We believe the popular storyline — “Model X is trained on TPUs, therefore TPUs are the future” — misses the reality. Our view is that some major model training has indeed leveraged TPUs, but the data points toward a mixed approach where GPU-class architectures become increasingly necessary for frontier-scale, communication-heavy work. Our research indicates there’s also a pragmatic factor. Specifically, when accelerators are constrained, it’s rational to push existing assets to their limits. In that context, using available TPUs aggressively is not a statement that TPUs are the end state — it’s an optimization under supply constraints. We’re not bearish on TPUs. They are mature, and the engineering behind them is impressive. But we believe Nvidia’s moat is reinforced by an end-to-end architecture designed for bandwidth, scale, and sustained utilization — the attributes that matter most as AI factories move from impressive single-system demos to large-scale production infrastructure. We believe the recent TPU enthusiasm is less about a structural shift away from Nvidia and more about the fact that volumes are constrained, demand is outstripping supply, and every hyperscaler is operating under scarcity. In this environment, buyers and builders will use whatever credible compute they can get — and that dynamic is amplifying the availability and capabilities of TPUs, as well as other alternatives. The biggest constraint our research points to right now is packaging capacity. CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate) is a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. packaging technology that takes chiplets from the wafer and integrates them onto a substrate so they can be connected with very high-speed communication. In our view, this is foundational to modern AI systems that depend on fast movement between chips and across complex multichip architectures. The key point is that when CoWoS capacity is tight, it constrains the output of advanced AI accelerators regardless of how strong demand is. The chart above shows projected consumption across Nvidia, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and others — and importantly, it reflects all chips, not only AI chips. That matters because portions of the non-Nvidia consumption are serving other product categories and process needs. But the bottom line remains that AI chips are being governed by the same packaging bottleneck. In the data referenced, total CoWoS capacity expands materially over time with Nvidia locking up more than 60% of the volume: At the same time, the compute and system efficiency of the leading platforms improves as Nvidia transitions through architectural steps — from GB200 to GB300 and then Rubin — alongside improvements in switching and overall system design. In our opinion, the market should view these trends in tandem – that is, capacity increases, but so does the performance per system, which reinforces the economics for the vendors that can both secure volume and move fastest down the experience curve. The leading vendor, by far, in this scenario is Nvidia. We believe one of the most underappreciated points in the current narrative is that Nvidia has effectively pre-bought and securured meaningful CoWoS capacity. As a result, even as the pie expands, Nvidia is positioned to maintain significant share over the planning horizon discussed — with the projection that by 2027 it still holds roughly 61% of the referenced market. For AI chips specifically our estimate is that Nvidia will maintain closer to ~80% of the market. Our view is that share will be determined by unit economics. Our premise is that Nvidia has volume leadership and has locked up a critical bottleneck input, which will confer structural cost advantage and flywheel effects to the company. In a supply constrained environment, hyperscalers will pursue a blended strategy. In the case of Google, it will use TPUs where they fit, and GPUs where they’re required, to generally maximize access to any capable compute. We believe that’s what’s driving much of the current TPU buzz — not a belief that TPUs will broadly displace GPUs for frontier-scale, communication-heavy workloads. We also believe it’s unlikely that a major hyperscaler (Google in this case) will broadly sell its proprietary accelerators to direct competitors in a way that creates a real external market. Claims and rumors may circulate, but in our opinion the more plausible driver behind “TPUs in the wild” narratives is ecosystem pressure from partners (for example Broadcom) and Meta Platforms Inc. (looking for any advantage right now). In short, we don’t see this as a strategic decision by Google to become a true merchant silicon provider. We believe the most important takeaway from this segment is the connection between the following three factors: In our view, this combination positions Nvidia, with near term platforms like GB300 and especially Rubin, to become the low-cost producers of tokens versus alternatives — not simply because of peak performance claims, but because scale and secured capacity will translate into superior economics. We believe the market is in a phase where every credible AI vendor can sell everything they can build because supply is scarce. But our research indicates this will change as capacity catches up over the next couple of years. Historically, semiconductors tend to swing from undersupply to oversupply — timing this is hard, but our research suggests there is still meaningful runway, and that the near-term (including 2026) remains supply-constrained rather than surplus-driven. Net-net: TPUs are getting attention because the market supply is short. CoWoS is a core bottleneck. And Nvidia’s ability to lock up capacity and ride the experience curve reinforces both share and cost position as the cycle matures. In a recent investor podcast, Gavin Baker went deep into the economics of GPUs and TPUs. It’s worth listening to the entire conversion. We pulled a clip from that discussion, which succinctly articulates the pending economic shift coming in the near term. What follows is our assessment of that conversation blended with our premise: We believe the “low-cost producer” framing is critical, but it’s often misunderstood and not applied rigorously. In our view, being the low-cost producer has always mattered in scaled markets — the nuance is whether people mean unit cost, delivered price or economic margin structure. When viewed through that perspective, Google’s position as the current low-cost producer for AI chips is increasingly fragile as the stack shifts and as the economics of TPU/ASIC supply chains become more clear. Our research aligns with Gavin Baker’s narrative, which indicates Google has enjoyed meaningful cost advantages in parts of its AI stack and has leaned into that position by aggressively approaching the market. Google can “bomb” AI with low-cost capacity because when you can drive lower unit costs, you can push more supply into the market and press competitors on price and availability. But we believe that advantage is highly dependent on the underlying performance curve and the economics of the hardware supply chain — and both are moving. We believe one under-appreciated structural advantage for Nvidia is the learning loop created when a major deployment runs infrastructure at extreme scale. In our view, large-scale Blackwell deployments — particularly the kind of “push it to the limits” rollout that X.ai is driving — act as a forcing function that exposes bugs, tightens systems performance and accelerates resilience. Nvidia learns from this and then propagates those learnings across its customer base, which translates into a time-to-market advantage that is difficult for alternatives to match unless Nvidia stumbles operationally. In our opinion, this dynamic will compound as scale finds issues faster, fixes get distributed broadly and the platform improves as more customers run it in production-like conditions. Gemini 3, as Baker points out, has demonstrated the scaling laws are still working. Our research indicates that, if scaling continues to pay off, then the market’s center of gravity shifts toward whoever can deliver the most training and inference work per dollar, per watt and per unit time — at scale. That’s where Nvidia’s roadmap is positioned to reassert its dominance as GB300’s are drop-in-compatible with GB200. The delta from Hopper to Blackwell was nontrivial. We’ve previously reported the lower reliability of GB200-based racks due new cooling requirements, rack densities and the overall complexity of the transition. But early reports suggest GB300-based configurations at neoclouds are performing exceptionally well with low friction for upgrades from GB200-based infrastructure. This compatibility accelerates deployment velocity, and improves the probability that customers stay on the Nvidia upgrade path rather than detouring into architectural forks. And the economics favor Nvidia. We believe the economics of the TPU/ASIC stack are often overlooked. A critical constraint is if a large portion of value accrues to a supplier (for example Broadcom as Google’s ASIC partner), then the “low-cost producer” claim becomes more complicated. Gavin Baker estimates at scale, roughly $15 billion of Google’s $30 billion TPU revenue goes to Broadcom, which eats a major share of the margin pool. Baker used a simply analogy that Google is like the architect and Broadcom is the builder – it manages the TSMC relationship. He correctly points out that Apple has taken control of both the front-end design and all the back-end work, including managing TSMC, because at its scale, that level of vertical integration makes sense. This dynamic puts pressure on Google’s behavior over time. Even if TPU unit economics look attractive in isolation, the supplier margin structure can erode the sustained ability to undercut the market — especially as Nvidia’s performance-per-system improves. Baker stated that the OpEx for Broadcom’s entire semi division is $5 billion, so at scale, Google paying Broadcom $15 billion may become less attractive. We believe the roadmap implication is that GB300 will reset the cost curve and Rubin extends it again, the space between Nvidia and TPU/ASIC alternatives increases dramatically. In our opinion, that doesn’t make TPUs irrelevant; it makes them situational. As Nvidia’s platform becomes a lower-cost token producer at scale, alternatives are forced into narrower lanes or into “use what you have” strategies. This topic is reminiscent of a battle in the disk drive business in the 1980s. Seagate was a leading manufacturer of hard drives at the time and pursued a vertically integrated strategy, manufacturing its own heads, media and the drives themselves. In the 1980’s, Quantum was struggling with manufacturing quality but revived its business by outsourcing production to MKE, a world-class Japanese-based manufacturer. Though this required tight engineering coordination between designers and manufacturing, it addressed Quantum’s “back-end” challenges. Quantum began to gain share rapidly and its stock price rose. This author, in a conversation with industry legend Al Shugart, CEO of Seagate, asked if this was a new business model that had merit. Shugart said simply, “When you have to pay someone to make your product, you make less.” He further intimated that long-term, when the industry consolidated, he would be the last man standing. At the time there were around 80 hard drive manufacturers. Today there are three, with Seagate the most valuable. There’s a tight linkage between silicon and models. In this next section we move further up the stack and examine the recent narrative around Google, Gemini and OpenAI. Our research indicates the competitive battle is moving up the stack. Thoough there’s excitement about the rapid improvement in model capability — and we believe larger, more complete models will continue to emerge as AI factories ramp — a key strategic premise of ours is that model quality alone won’t be the enduring differentiator. In our view, the center of gravity shifts to: As laid out above, even if Google can claim periods of cost advantage today, we believe Nvidia’s platform learnings, drop-in upgrade path and performance roadmap — combined with the margin realities embedded in TPU supply chains — shift the “low-cost producer” advantage back toward Nvidia over the next two cycles and likely beyond. We believe it’s fair to say Gemini 3 has had a meaningful impact on the AI conversation, particularly in reinforcing that scaling laws remain intact. But we also believe some of the widely circulated charts — especially those implying ChatGPT is “leveling off” while Gemini is “exploding” — are potentially misleading if they’re used as a proxy for durable competitive advantage or for what matters most economically. Our view is that user growth charts are easy to over-interpret because they compress very different distribution mechanics into a single line. A product can appear to “explode” in monthly active users from bundling, defaults, integration points or placement — while another can appear to “flatten” even as usage quality, monetization and ecosystem affinity remain strong. The data suggests there’s more nuance here than the headline narrative implies. The more important factor, in our opinion, is that Alphabet’s economic center of gravity is still advertising — particularly Search and related advertising properties. As shown below, Google generates an enormous amount of operating profit from advertising, with very large operating margins. Cloud, though meaningful in absolute dollars and improving in profitability, is still minor relative to the scale of Search-driven operating profit. Even at rising operating margin levels, the cloud business is small compared with the hundreds of billions in operating profit and cash generation tied to the advertising machine. And the “Other Bets” category is economically immaterial in the context of the overall profit engine. Google has arguably the world’s best technology marketplace in the form of Search — extraordinary query volume, an unparalleled advertising monetization model and a highly efficient compute foundation that reinforces profitability. The system works, and it works at massive scale. The dilemma, in our view, is how Google migrates from that dominant model to something “more complete” without undermining the profit engine that made it dominant in the first place. The data suggests the challenge is not whether Google can build strong AI models — it clearly can. The challenge is whether it can evolve the product and business model of Search in a way that preserves economics while moving toward a new interaction paradigm. Our strategic questions for Google are: Gemini’s momentum is impressive, but we believe the larger story is economic and structural. Google’s strength in search creates the very dilemma it has to solve to lead the next phase. We believe the earlier monthly active user charts tell an incomplete story that can be misleading if used to infer leadership or monetization power. The more instructive view is engagement as shown above. Specifically, the SimilarWeb data shows user minutes on the web — because time spent is a better proxy for intensity of use, dependency, and ultimately monetizable opportunity. ChatGPT maintains a meaningful lead in user minutes, even as Gemini is growing quickly. The chart also shows fast growth from other entrants (for example DeepSeek and Grok), but in our view the competitive reality remains concentrated and it’s primarily a two-horse race for the bulk of user attention between ChatGPT and Gemini. The key metric is not only “who is growing,” but who is capturing time. We believe the implications become more acute when you overlay Google’s economic model. Google’s profit engine is built on advertising monetization tied to search behavior — high volume, low marginal cost and well-optimized conversion funnels. That machine depends on serving an enormous number of ad opportunities efficiently. But if the interaction model shifts toward ChatGPT-style experiences — richer answers, longer sessions and more compute-heavy responses — the cost structure changes dramatically. Our research indicates each unit of engagement in an assistant-style model is materially more compute-intensive than the classic search model. The point made above is for a comparable “user minute,” the assistant model can consume on the order of ~10 times more compute resources to generate substantially richer output for the end user. In our view, this is the crux of why merging an AI assistant interaction model with an ad-funded business model is not trivial: So although an AI-native interface may create a more compelling product, it also risks turning the economics of ad delivery from a high-margin machine into a heavier-cost model — unless monetization mechanics evolve to compensate. We believe user minutes is a better metric than MAUs, but it still doesn’t fully capture the true shift. Time spent doesn’t directly measure the quantity and richness of knowledge being produced and delivered into the market — and that richness is precisely what drives the compute intensity. The bottom line is engagement is the right metric, but the deeper point is economic. If the market moves from low-cost search interactions to compute-heavy assistant interactions, the cost to serve — and therefore the cost to monetize — rises sharply. That’s the pressure point for Google’s ad-dominated business model in our view. We believe a common refrain — “Google will just disrupt itself” — ignores the single most important constraint in that the economics of search are uniquely favorable to Google, and moving from classic search to an assistant-style interaction model changes the unit economics in a way that can break the profit engine. Our research indicates the cost of a search is a fraction of a cent. That outcome is the product of: In our view, this is arguably the cheapest large-scale compute service in the world, and among the best-operated at global scale. The point is that revenue per search is ~five times to 10 times the gross margin on the cost of the search itself. That’s the heart of the extraordinary business model Google has built – ultra-low unit cost paired with a monetization engine that extracts high value per interaction. In our opinion, you don’t casually disrupt a model with those economics — not because you lack vision, but because the alternative must clear a very high economic bar. Our research indicates the nature of search queries supports these economics: This is a high-volume, low-complexity workload. It is optimized for speed, efficiency and monetization — not for generating richly reasoned outputs. Our central claim is that if Google converts this ultra-cheap interaction into an OpenAI-style experience — richer responses, longer sessions, higher compute per interaction — the cost structure rises sharply. If cost per “search” increases by an order of magnitude while monetization mechanics remain in the old ad model, the economics compress and the business model can break. The bottom line is Google can absolutely innovate, but the data indicates self-disruption is economic surgery. The existing search machine is optimized around simplicity and margin. Shifting to compute-intensive assistant behavior without a new monetization model risks collapsing the very engine that funds the transition. The debate about whether Google can disrupt itself becomes much clearer when you model cost per session rather than looking at top-line user counts. As indicated, the economics of classic Google search are engineered around extremely low cost per interaction and very high-margin monetization. Assistant-style sessions invert that equation. Our research indicates the cost per interaction for Google Search is in the range of roughly 0.2 to 0.5 (as presented on the slide above), and because queries per session are low, the resulting cost per session is still “less than pennies.” The monetization model is also tightly coupled to this structure in that Google monetizes with ads per query, and the combination of low cost + strong ad yield produces very high margins. In our view, this is why Google Search has been such a durable business model. It is a highly optimized, low-cost service that is monetized efficiently at massive scale. ChatGPT’s cost per interaction is much higher, and the session pattern is different with five to 10 queries per session rather than the short, lightweight search interactions. When you multiply those factors, the cost per session becomes dramatically higher — we think ~100 times higher than Google Search. Importantly, the point is not that ChatGPT is inefficient. The claim is that ChatGPT is already among the leaders in efficiency — and yet the underlying interaction paradigm is still much more compute-intensive per session. We believe this is the core reason Google can’t simply flip Search into a ChatGPT-like model without destabilizing margins. Our research indicates the most economically valuable portion of search is product and commercial search — only ~10% to 20% of queries, but responsible for ~60% to 70% of search revenue. In our view, that concentration is exactly what makes the transition so difficult. Specifically: We believe this is one of the most important ideas in the entire research note. The model moves from low-cost ads and blue links thrown at users toward a higher-value, higher-cost information economy where trust and accurate representation are the product. In our view, this has two direct implications: Google’s current approach — offering a hybrid path where users can go deeper into AI mode — is both clever and useful. In an ideal world, Google would prefer to introduce assistant-style experiences slowly, ring-fence them as a separate business, and price them at a premium. But the point is that reality constrains the strategy because Google has to protect the commercial-search numbers. And though Google would like to layer higher-value services on top and charge advertisers materially more, it may be easier for challengers to enter with higher-cost, higher-trust services without needing to defend a legacy margin structure. This, we believe, is OpenAI’s advantage. That tension makes the hybrid model look less like a stable end state and more like a transitional strategy — a fence-sitter that ultimately has to resolve toward one economic model or the other. In our view, the market is carving into two distinct conflicts: The bottom line is cost per session is the economic forcing function in this new game. It explains why self-disruption is difficult, why the high-value commercial slice is vulnerable and why the market may shift from cheap ad inventory toward higher-cost, trust-based representation. This is the battle line for the next decade. We believe the core issue in “the future of search” is not model quality. The issue is a revenue model mismatch. Traditional search is an ad-funded machine optimized to deliver low-cost discovery — effectively “10 blue links” thrown at the user — where monetization is tied to placement and clicks, not to the intrinsic quality and trustworthiness of the information delivered. As search becomes answer-centric and trust-centric, our research indicates a large portion of Google’s profit pool becomes exposed. In this research we try to make a concentrated revenue point that we believe is the linchpin: In our view, this is the part of the business that is most vulnerable to trust erosion. If users begin to believe the answer is optimized for the advertiser rather than for the buyer, the value proposition degrades quickly — and that small slice is exactly where buyers are most sensitive to quality, ranking integrity and confidence. The risk is that Google can retain the bulk of total search volume and still lose the economically decisive segment: “90% of search,” but not the part that pays the bills. Our research indicates generating an answer with generative AI is at least an order of magnitude more expensive than a classic, highly optimized search query — and potentially two or three orders depending on the experience design. At Google’s scale, even modest mix shifts toward AI-heavy sessions can have outsized margin impact. We believe this becomes both a timing and a strategy issue. In other words, the transition begins to bite into margins as usage patterns migrate, and the company has to manage a delicate balance between to countervailing forces: From the consumer standpoint, there is an upside in that users can increasingly choose between low-cost traditional search and higher-quality, higher-trust answer engines. But that optionality increases competitive pressure. Because Google’s search share is so highly elevated, it has nowhere to go but down from here, because the competitive axis is shifting. In classic search, if the result isn’t good, the user simply refines the query and continues. In assistant-driven search, as users build affinity for an engine that consistently returns higher-quality outcomes, has memory and trust becomes the moat. The platform that earns that trust can pull disproportionate share of the highest-value sessions. The key point is even if Google’s model quality is strong, the business model incentives are different. In our view, the future state is not “smarter ads.” It’s a different value chain where brands need to be represented accurately, compared appropriately, and surfaced based on fit — not on who bought the top slot. The premise of this research captures the delta – a complex, high-intent request can be satisfied in a single minute with ranked options and an action plan, versus a longer, more iterative search process. Our research indicates that this “high-quality commercial search” experience is precisely where share can migrate — and it’s the most economically meaningful slice that moves. We believe OpenAI has a structural incentive advantage rooted in its revenue model: That incentive system is fundamentally different from ad-funded search where the buyer is not the user, and where brands pay for placement. In our opinion, this creates a more direct “quality to revenue” linkage for the assistant platform. On the brand side, our research indicates the emerging play is buyer-facing APIs backed by trusted information, designed to score well in answer engines. That is a different marketing and distribution model than classic search engine optimization and paid links. We believe the right way to frame it is SEO is not dead, but it will matter less over time. As answer engines mediate discovery and ranking through trust and structured vendor information, the importance of classic SEO mechanics declines. Our view is that the market bifurcates in a way that can still look “good” in absolute terms for Google while being strategically disruptive: Google will fight hard for that high-value slice, but our research indicates it requires substantial work above the model layer: APIs, software capabilities, interface design and the surrounding service stack that enables vendors and users to extract real utility from the platform. Bottom line is the future of search is a restructuring of incentives and economics. The platform that aligns trust, representation quality and monetization has the advantage in the most valuable part of the market. We believe it’s useful to end this segment in the context of an earlier Breaking Analysis where we put forth a plausible scenario where Google could have disrupted OpenAI’s first-mover advantage. That scenario was not irrational — it was rooted in Google’s deep technical bench, its distribution and the assumption that it could translate model strength into product and platform leadership. But the picture on the slide above — “OpenAI likely to retain its leadership” — reflects what our research indicates today – the conditions that sustain OpenAI’s lead are strengthening, not weakening. Our view is that the market is over-fixated on model-to-model comparisons. The reality is that the leading labs will all produce very high-quality LLMs. Google’s models are strong. Anthropic’s Claude has positioned around coding. Gemini has demonstrated competence in many tasks and Grok is moving fast. The point is not that any one of these is “bad.” We believe the durable differentiation is shifting away from raw model quality and toward: Our research indicates OpenAI maintains leadership in several areas: We also believe OpenAI’s close relationship with Nvidia matters. Our contention is if Nvidia remains the critical supplier for frontier compute, and if OpenAI is tightly coupled to that ecosystem, then OpenAI is positioned to receive preferential allocation versus competitors — particularly versus those whose narrative depends on Nvidia being displaced. In our view, that allocation dynamic reinforces time-to-capability and time-to-market. The most important datapoint in this segment, in our opinion, is the mix shift described between consumer usage and enterprise adoption. We note movement from roughly 70/30 (users/enterprise) last year to about 60/40 by the end of this year. We believe this is a meaningful signal because enterprise growth tends to be stickier and more platform-defining than consumer novelty. Our research indicates enterprise adoption will increase as organizations learn how to: In our view, that enterprise “data readiness” journey is what turns an AI model into an enterprise system — and that is where platform advantage compounds. We believe Google has advantages and will remain a formidable competitor. But our premise is that OpenAI is more likely to emerge as a high-quality software and platform player in enterprise AI than Google, which — despite being strong technically — is not broadly perceived as the enterprise AI software leader. Our view is that this matters because the next phase of competition is not “who has the best model demo,” but “who owns the workflow and the integration fabric.” Our research indicates OpenAI is “a country mile ahead” at the moment in platform momentum. That does not mean the lead is unassailable. OpenAI could blow up, or competitors could find superior approaches. But as of now, we believe the most likely outcome is continued leadership because the factors that matter most — platform, developer adoption, enterprise mix shift and access to scarce compute — are currently aligned in OpenAI’s favor. The two big conclusions of this Breaking Analysis are: The bottom line is the early “Google disrupts OpenAI” scenario was plausible. But the data and the platform dynamics suggest OpenAI’s first-mover advantage is evolving into something more durable — especially as the enterprise becomes the center of gravity. OpenAI’s relationship with Nvidia is meaningful.

Smart glasses grew beyond analysts' predictions, Oura crushed rivals with patents, and Garmin charged a premium for new models. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. It's been a dramatic 2025 for wearables. Some trends were predictable, like smart glasses continuing their exponential growth and smartwatches adding more AI and health features. But I didn't anticipate some things, like Oura lawsuits strangling its smart ring rivals or the impact of tariffs. I've decided to look back on my 2025 forecast for smart rings, glasses, and watches, including two analysts' predictions, and judge how well our collective expectations lined up with reality. Then, I'll look at the biggest wearable and fitness watch brands and grade their 2025 performance — where they succeeded and how they could have done better. As expected, Garmin tested "loyal users' willingness to buy pricier status-symbol smartwatches." The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro ($1.2–2K) and Venu X1 ($800) are clear examples, but even mid-rangers like the Venu 4 ($550) have become more high-end. Add in the $800 Apple Watch Ultra 3, $500 and $650 Galaxy Watches, and the $1,000 Polar Grit X2 Pro, and you can see brands normalizing phone-level prices (and offsetting tariff costs). It was also expected that there would be "more options" for thrifty consumers. The Apple Watch SE 3 qualifies, sticking to its old $250 price, but it's the exception. We saw cheap trackers from Xiaomi and CMF, but very few cheap Android smartwatches besides discounted last-gen models. Even Amazfit sold as many $300+ watches as $100 ones. Tariffs have interfered with budget options, making it more profitable to attract wealthier hobbyists. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Meanwhile, Google, Samsung, and Apple started pushing the idea of smartwatch AI in 2025. But it's still mostly on-phone processing of queries and health data analysis. The Pixel Watch 4 and Apple Watch S11 have on-watch AI tools like smart replies or live translation, and I appreciate how Gemini on Android watches syncs well with Google apps. I expect a bigger AI push in 2026, particularly with the Fitbit Personal Health Coach AI. Again, companies clearly want smartwatches to become medical devices, but we're still in the predictive "wellness" phase. For example, Samsung added virtual doctor's visits and prescription management while giving its watches vascular health and antioxidant index analysis, with heart failure warnings coming soon. That said, my analyst's prediction of direct blood pressure monitoring on watches in 2025 didn't happen. But Apple started offering hypertension alerts, while Fitbit and Oura launched hypertension studies — so at least we're getting warning signs for high blood pressure. As for smart rings, I don't have hard figures for 2025 yet, but IDC's current estimates show it's a tiny but growing sliver compared to fitness trackers, and growing much more slowly than smart glasses. Sales have grown, but I'm expecting the category to stagnate. Oura has leveraged its patents to demand royalty payments from every major smart ring brand, bringing Circular and RingConn to heel, successfully banning Ultrahuman from the U.S., and currently challenging Samsung. The current rumor is that Samsung won't make a Galaxy Ring 2, and there's little hope for competition and innovation in the space if brands like Fitbit and Apple decide it's not worth the legal hassle — or giving Oura a cut of the profits — to make a smart ring. Finally, IDC's Jitesh Ubrani wasn't bullish on smart glasses' future last year, saying that "most consumers don't need" the photo/ video/ music/ AI combo and that sales would only climb from 2.5 million to 3.5 million in 2025. Turns out, IDC's current forecast is 9.4 million glasses sold in 2025, Meta's Ray-Ban/Oakley partner EssilorLuxottica has ramped up production to 10 million per year, and Ubrani is much more enthusiastic about smart glasses' future. That said, 10 million sold may not qualify as "mainstream," compared to 200 million smartwatches and trackers in 2025. The Samsung AI and HUD glasses coming in 2026 should help the category continue to grow, especially internationally. Garmin launched a series of successful, high-quality watches this year: the Instinct 3 for hikers and campers, the Vivoactive 6 for thrifty indoor athletes and daily step-counters, the Forerunner 570 for runners and triathletes, the Forerunner 970 for pro-level athletes and trail runners, and the Venu 4 as the all-around best option. Unfortunately, Garmin raised watch prices across its entire lineup for extra revenue, delivering strong earnings but making them less accessible to everyday athletes. As much as I love the Venu X1, I can't recommend people spend $800 on one. From an economic standpoint, Garmin has become a top-5 brand for worldwide smartwatch sales. Despite that, Garmin's stock plummeted because its uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro couldn't compete with last year's massive Fenix 8 sales, undoing all its gains. The new Garmin Connect+ subscription, which launched this year, may have earned some profits, but Garmin fans have never embraced the feature, especially when it's required for features like Garmin Trails, extra badges, and their Year in Review summary. Unrealistic shareholder expectations aside, Garmin has had a strong year, but its tendency to price-lock the best features to Fenix-level watches is harder to stomach when the "cheaper" models are still expensive. And you never know when there'll be a major blue triangle crash. I won't grade every fitness watch brand, but I'm highlighting COROS because it's had a strong 2025 as a foil to Garmin. The COROS Nomad, Apex 4, and Pace 4 have each impressed me with their accurate GPS and HR data, weeks of battery life, affordable prices, and fast performance for trail and street maps. COROS gained some ground on its rivals with vital features: media playback controls, move alerts, undo laps, flashlight mode, cycle tracking, mid-activity voice alerts, street names and POIs on maps, and an adventure journal. Equally important, COROS updates its entire lineup, rather than price-lock features to the flagships. It makes models like the $300 COROS Pace Pro feel like a great value, because you get tools like offline maps and Strava Live Segments that only $600+ Garmin watches have. It's no coincidence that COROS is the "fastest-growing watch brand year-over-year on Strava" in the app's 2025 end-of-year report. It won't catch up to Garmin (2nd overall) anytime soon, but COROS has earned a reputation for budget quality with serious athletes — stealing Garmin's customers. COROS's main 2025 blemish was an IT exposé revealing major security vulnerabilities on all COROS watches, letting hackers potentially access your account, snoop on notifications, and worse. COROS says it has resolved these issues, thankfully. Oura reports selling 5.5 million rings so far, with half those sales in the past 12 months. It also has a new U.S. DoD contract, which requires them to build a manufacturing facility in Texas. This deal also caused some backlash over fears Oura would share private data with the Trump administration, but CEO Tom Hale has reassured otherwise. The Oura Ring 4 continuously received new features in 2025. The LLM-powered Oura Advisor is the centerpiece, giving advice and coaching based on your ring stats. The AI Meals tool gives you a nutritional summary of your plate with a photo. Your Oura Ring can now track pregnancy and premenopause symptoms. Its Preventive Health data studies signs of cumulative stress. The list goes on! Oura also launched the Ring 4 Ceramic, a more expensive model with premium zirconia ceramic materials. While our tester praised how "incredibly soft" it feels to wear, he's also noticed areas where the finish has been "scratched off" from wear and tear, and that the new finish makes it "noticeably thicker and a bit heavier" than the normal Ring 4. Overall, Oura kept users happy with new features, made record-breaking profits, and weaponized patents to scuttle its biggest rival (Ultrahuman) and demand royalties from the rest. That's a good business position to be in. Meta released three pairs of smart glasses in 2025, which is a significant accomplishment. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the centerpiece, and while it isn't significantly different from the original, the extra hours of battery and 3K video do make it easier to recommend. The Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses cater specifically to the athletic crowd, particularly with the Garmin integration, and while I loved them, it'll take time to see whether they resonate because of the weight and price. The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses have struck a chord with the tech niche, with some impressive HUD features that have started to live up to the Google Glass idea people have waited a decade for. They're too thick, heavy, and expensive to break out of that niche, but it's a step in the right direction. Hardware aside, Meta has done well with software updates in 2025. It added Meta AI support for several apps (Audible, Spotify, Google Calendar, Outlook, and Weather), released Live AI and Live Translation, sped up camera captures, and brought Gen 2 features like improved stabilization to the Gen 1 glasses.

Posted on December 21, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment When it comes to ecommerce, standing out means ditching cookie-cutter templates for product pages that not only captivate but also convert. With Divi 5‘s Woo Product Modules, you can build high-impact product pages entirely from scratch, all while seamlessly integrating real-time WooCommerce data. In this post, we’ll walk you through creating a product page from scratch using Divi 5’s 17 Woo Product Modules and the Theme Builder. Let’s get started. Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules represent a step forward in ecommerce design, offering 17 native modules that pull dynamic data directly from WooCommerce. You’ll have full control over every element, from eye-catching visuals to seamless user interactions via Divi’s intuitive Visual Builder. To make sense of this toolkit, we’ve grouped the 17 modules into four intuitive categories based on their roles in a typical product page flow. Each integrates effortlessly with Woo’s backend, ensuring your content stays fresh and functional. Let’s break them down: Start strong by guiding users and keeping them informed with these foundational elements that handle orientation and real-time feedback. At the heart of any compelling product page, these modules showcase the essentials: visuals, details, and specs that hook visitors and build trust. With these modules, you can turn passive browsers into active buyers. Wrap up with smart upselling and broader explorations, using these to extend sessions and inflate order values. With these modules, you’re not just building pages but creating experiences that convert. In the next section, we’ll roll up our sleeves and step through building a custom product page, from layout to launch. If you’d like to follow along with a completed design, fill out the form below to download the files. Join the Divi Newsletter and we will email you a copy of the ultimate Divi Landing Page Layout Pack, plus tons of other amazing and free Divi resources, tips and tricks. Follow along and you will be a Divi master in no time. If you are already subscribed simply type in your email address below and click download to access the layout pack. This section will guide you through creating a modern product page using Divi 5’s Woo Product Modules. By the end, you’ll have a fully functional product page that beautifully showcases each product on your site. Here’s a quick preview: You’ll want to ensure that WooCommerce is installed and activated and that you have created at least one product. Next, navigate to Divi > Theme Builder and click the + Add New Template button. Once the modal appears, click Build New Template. In the Template Settings modal, scroll down to and check All Products. Click Create Template to continue. Next, click Add Custom Body. When the Theme Builder loads, select Build From Scratch from the available options. Add a single column row to the page. When the Insert Module Or Row modal appears, locate the Woo Modules option and select it. Locate the Woo Breadcrumbs module and add it to the row. By default, This Product will be selected in the Product dropdown menu in the Content tab. This option will allow Divi 5 to easily pull content for each product in every category. For this tutorial, we will select a product to display to make it easier to see how the layout will look with an actual product in view. As you add modules to the design, ensure that This Product is always selected. Click over to the Design tab and expand the Text dropdown menu. Ensure the Paragraph tab is selected and choose Poppins as the Text Font, #5a4130 as the Text Color, and 14px as the Text Text Size. Next, select the Links tab in the Text menu. Select Poppins as the Link Font, Underline as the Link Font Style, and #83A65B as the Link Text Color. Next, add a two-column row directly underneath the first row in the layout. In the left column, add the Woo Product Images module to the column. Swap to the Design tab. Expand the Image menu followed by the Border menu. Set the Image Border Radius to 20px on all sides. Scroll down to reveal the Sale Badge menu. Expand it and add #C77347 as the Sale Badge Color. In the Text menu, select Poppins as the Sale Badge Font, Uppercase for the Sale Badge Font Style, #ffffff as the Sale Badge Text Color, and 15px as the Sale Badge Text Size. Add the Woo Product Title module in the second column. Select the Design tab and expand the Title Text menu. Set the Title Heading Level to H1, Poppins as the Title Font, and #5A4130 as the Title Text Color. Set the Title Text Size to 4em. If you want to make the layout responsive as you go along, you can click the Edit Responsive Values button to make immediate changes to any module, saving time as you design the page. When the Responsive Editor modal appears, you can adjust the values in real-time. Enter 2.75em for tablet and phone views. Next, add the Woo Product Rating module underneath the Title in the second column. In the Design tab, expand the Star Rating menu. Set the Star Rating Text Alignment to Left, #5A4130 as the Star Rating Text Color, 15px as the Star Rating Text Size, and 1px as the Star Rating Letter Spacing. Next, expand the Text menu. Enter Poppins as the Text Font, #5A4130 as the Text Text Color, and 13px as the Text Text Size. Next, add the Woo Product Description Module to the second column. In the Content tab, decide whether to use the Description or Short Description in the Description Type field. Switch to the Design tab. Expand the Text dropdown menu and select Poppins as the Text Font, #5A4130 as the Text Text Color, and 1.8em as the Text Line Height. Next, we’ll add the Woo Product Price module to the second column. Expand the Price Text menu. Select Poppins as the Price Font and #5A4130 as the Price Text Color. Add the Woo Product Add To Cart module. In the Design tab, expand the Field Labels menu and enter Poppins as the Field Labels Font. In the Field Labels Text Color field, use #5A4130. Next, expand the Fields menu. Enter #5A4130 in the Fields Background Color and Fields Focus Background Color fields. Set the Opacity to 0. In the Fields Focus Text Color field, enter #5A4130. Expand the Fields Text menu. Enter Poppins as the Field Font, #5A4130 as the Fields Text Color, and 16px as the Fields Text Size. Next, expand the Field Border menu. In the Fields Border Radius settings, enter 5px. Add 1px Field Border Width and set the Fields Border Color to #5A4130. In the Dropdown Menu settings, set the Dropdown Menus Background Color and Fields Focus Background Color to #5A4130 with an Opacity of 0. Set the Dropdown Menus Focus Text Color to #5A4130. Next, expand the Field Spacing settings. Set the Dropdown Menu Margin to 5px on all sides. In the Module Text dropdown menu, enter Poppins as the Dropdown Menu Font, #5A4130 as the Dropdown Menu Text Color, and 13px as the Dropdown Menu Text Size. Next, expand the Field Border menu. Add 1px Dropdown Menus Border Width and set the Dropdown Menus Border Color to #5A4130. The last step in this module is to style the Button. Expand the Button menu and toggle Use Custom Styles For Button on. Expand the Button Background settings and assign #83A65B as the Button Background Color. In the Button Border menu, add 50px Button Border Radius. In the Button Text menu, use Poppins as the Button Font, Uppercase in the Button Font Style, and 15px for the Button Text Size. Finally, in the Button Spacing menu, add 15px Button Padding to the top and bottom and 35px for the left and right. The last module to add to the second column of the row is the Woo Product Meta module. In the Design tab, expand the Text menu. For the Paragraph tab, enter Poppins as the Meta Font, Left in the Meta Text Alignment field, and #5A4130 in the Meta Text Color field. Tab over to Links. Select Poppins as the Link Font and enter #83A65B as the Link Text Color. Add a new single-column row under the two-column row that houses our product info. Select the Woo Product Tabs module. Expand the Body Text menu. Enter Poppins for the Font and set the Text Color to #5A4130. Next, expand the Tab Text menu. Enter #83A65B as the Active Tab Text Color and #5A4130 as the Tab Text Color. Set the Tab Font to Poppins. Add a new single-column row. Select and add the Woo Related Products module to the page. Expand the Overlay menu. Add #C77347 to the Overlay Icon Color field. Open the Image menu. In the Border settings, add 20px Image Border Radius to all sides. Select and expand the Star Rating menu. Set the Star Rating Text Alignment to Left. Use #C77347 for the Star Rating Text Color field. Open the Sale Badge menu. Enter #C77347 as the Sale Badge Color. Expand the Text menu. Select Poppins as the Sale Badge Font, set the Sale Badge Font Style to Uppercase, the Sale Badge Text Color to #ffffff, the Sale Badge Text Size to 15px, and the Sale Badge Letter Spacing to 1px. Next, open the Title Text menu. Use Poppins as the Title Font, #5A4130 as the Title Text Color, and 4em for the Title Text Size. Use Divi 5’s Responsive Editor to set the tablet and phone views to 2.75em. Open the Product Title Text menu. Enter Poppins for the Product Title Font and set the Product Title Text Alignment to Left. Use #5A4130 as the Product Title Text Color and set the Product Title Text Size to 16px. Use 1.2em as the Product Title Line Height. For the Price Text menu, enter Poppins as the Price Font and use #5A4130 as the Price Text Color. Finally, open the Sale Price Text menu. Use Poppins as the Sale Price Font. In the Sale Price Text Color field, enter #5A4130. Before saving your product page, use Divi 5’s Customizable Responsive Breakpoints to navigate through each screen size. This ensures that your layout looks seamless on every device. By default, Divi enables 3 breakpoints, but you can easily enable all 7 of them by clicking the ellipsis menu in Divi’s toolbar at the top of the Builder. Use the toggles to allow the breakpoints you’d like, then click the Save Button. As you navigate each breakpoint, you can easily change your design. Once you’ve made all the necessary refinements, save the product page in the Theme Builder. Click the Save Button at the top right corner of the Builder. When redirected back to the WordPress dashboard, save the Template by clicking the Save Changes Button. That’s it! As you can see, creating a polished and effective product page template is very easy thanks to Divi 5’s intuitive Visual Builder and Woo Product modules. Divi 5‘s Woo Product modules unlock creative freedom for your ecommerce site, letting you build product pages that are as unique as your brand. From navigation to dynamic display modules, these 17 native modules seamlessly integrate Woo data with Divi’s Visual Builder for engaging, responsive designs without using third-party plugins.

Pietro Laureano describes it beautifully in The Water Atlas. It’s one of the finest books I’ve ever seen. Here’s a pdf (big): https://catalogue.unccd.int/1148_The-water-atlas.pdf Thank you! “Finnish finance minister calls EU’s loan deal for Ukraine ‘major failure'” Gee, she is pretty sour about the EU only giving Zelensky €90 billion instead of those frozen/stolen Russian assets. I got an idea. Maybe Finnish Finance Minister Riikka Purra could tell the EU that Finland will step up to the plate and give Zelensky €120 billion from their coffers to make up the €210 billion that he was expecting. Hope that President Alexander Stubb is not reading this as he would regard that as a great idea. I feel like there are some matters of the conflict with respect to engineering or logistics I can speak to and understand. But the continued push to throw more and more money into the corrupt pit that is Ukraine baffles me. I can’t even ask NC’s favorite question, “cui bono?” I have no idea who could possibly benefit from this death and destruction. Especially since we have now proven our NATO weapons platforms don’t work and showing more people how badly they don’t work as the conflict continues can’t be good for business. Also, it appears from polling results that EUcrats aligned with the Ukraine project continue to do poorly and are now facing a resurgent right wing in their countries. So why is everyone in Europe so damn committed to death by 10000 cuts here? There is no plan for winning in the sense that the West have defined victory. Russia has been very clear that they’re not going to freeze the conflict or grant a ceasefire so Ukraine can lick its wounds and rre-arm. So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Are there any analysts who seem to have a clue? Thomas Fazi, on his Substack, makes an interesting argument: “ I intend to argue that the current NATO-Russia confrontation is simply the latest chapter in a century-long Western campaign to weaken, isolate and contain Russia. This antagonism long predates the Soviet Union and is rooted in both geopolitical and civilisational motives: Western powers have historically viewed Russia as too large, too independent and too culturally distinct to integrate into a Western-led order” https://www.thomasfazi.com/p/the-wests-century-long-war-against (Sorry if this has already been a link) With politicians who have the memory of a fish, explanations like this leave me uncomfortable. IMO this doesn’t make any sense and doesn’t help in any way or form to explain why the idiots in charge are playing the fool so much. We might try to find reasons back to the Middle Ages but let’s be clear, these are not “reasons” neither “roots” of conflict. Politicians have the minds of goldfish. The Rich like it that way. Ancient cultural imperatives and Prime Directives remove the need for “having a mind” and any goldfish can keep re-doing more of the same of what has been pre-done for the last thousand years. And with the “brain-parasites” from Eastern Europe and ” Legacy Great-Game Britain” now in firm command of NATO’s cultural brain-command centers, don’t be surprised if this is sustained until it can’t be, per Herbert Stein’s dictum that “anything that can’t continue will stop”. This will continue until it can’t, then it will stop. >>>So what are Finland, Germany, France, the UK, etc. doing here? Have you ever seen deer trapped in a car’s headlights? I think that see the oncoming wreck, but have no idea what to do except more of the same. I wonder if the continuing the war serves the cause of consolidating the EU into a kind of US of Europe. Indebting the member nations by funding Ukraine and having member states indebt themselves by expanding their militaries will increasingly put the EU under the tutelege of creditors. Creditors might prefer dealing with one central agency in Brussels rather than dozens of national capitals. Immigration/Police state Please see: https://jennbudd.substack.com/p/the-real-purpose-of-ice-raids This may be the reason that all of the border relief workers that I work with speak of seeing less BP and way more active military along the wall. People doing water drops are now regularly approached by bored military personnel wondering what’s going on. I have heard that BP agents who “go on safari” get significant bonus and Per Diem money. And since it is really boring patrolling out here, going off to tackle some guys in a Home Depot parking lot may look like fun While President Trump and the people he works with probably believe that they can suppress voters using the same methods as the Southern elites did after they overthrew Reconstruction, using goon squads (and let’s be serious here, death squads as both the police and the KKK were by the elites and not only in the South) would likely go very badly for them. If nothing else, I am not sure that the local police and the national guard would acquiesce, nor would the locals themselves. The Border Patrol would probably win in the first election, but once people got over their suprise, and after the ruling party lost its Mandate of Heaven, the loss of acceptance, and therefore authority and power would be extreme. The United States is still a quasi democracy and the government depends on the people’s acceptance of at least semi fair elections; it has been this way since almost two centuries before there was an United States. It is more of a cultural reflex or instinct than conscious thought. Historically authoritarianism has been expensive. Policing, containment and punishment compete for resources while simultaneously reducing manpower. Brutality, torture, terror and horror are then made political tools, pour encourager les autres. With this, and the redirection to MAGA aims of the vast American siloviki between Georgetown and Langley, team Trump hope to keep those domestic costs manageable. That said, the incompetence of it all in the face of our traditional myths of freedom, culture of satirical humor, and the basic decency amongst most of us commoners makes me believe you’re right and eventually we’ll vote again for something better! Correction. “Hope we will be offered the chance to vote for something better…..” Preventing that has been the plan so far…… Which has worked so far, but denying even the option of voting for the approved candidates is still likely to backfire. I don’t know. Denying the people the option of voting for “the other side” did sort of backfire on the Dems, but it didn’t exactly lead to any improvement, other than tearing down further what was already a dubious situation. That post is likely correct that the idea is to use ICE and border patrol to suppress black and latino votes. Given how its going and the stakes involved, I would guess in particular in the 2026 midterms. There are a number of other clues to such an agenda: Trump’s expressed wish to federalise the elections, Trump’s propaganda against postal voting, ICE and border patrol pushing the line by raids in court houses, Trump’s continued insistence that 2020 was stolen, the open gerrymandering. I think what might stop them is the polling. If it looks like they will still lose they might think twice. Or double down, depending on how desperate they are at that point. “India will surpass Germany to become third-largest economy by 2027: Scindia” I don’t mean to rain on India’s parade but it should be remembered that German is being rapidly deindustrialized as well as taking on colossal amounts of debt so it may not be so much a case of India rising here as Germany sinking. Here are the guys at The Duran talking about Merz and the German economy- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWCUgu_hzM4 (20:41 mins) I think part of the German decline is because they are paying dearly to India as a middle-man for Russian energy. The final phase of the decolonization of Europe – the idea being that a colonial system consist of the colonized and the colonizers, not really dipping into the idea that EU has been a colony of/exploited by US (that’s another discussion). Germany’s pains are largely self-inflicted. Their abrupt energy policy change some years ago resulted in loss of base load generating capacity. Most utility planners would call that stupid, inviting outages and soaring prices as alternatives were desperately sought. There are more orderly ways to transition over decent realistic intervals that don’t require such risks. Add in their so-called political class and that spelled trouble. Is acquiescing to Biden’s elimination of Nordstream the policy shift to which you refer? They had some problems before no doubt due to the same Greens who led them into war with Ukraine(once removed) shuttering base load, but industry didn’t actively start migrating until the Biden move forced it. Did the Germans blow Nordstream? The decision not to invest in new nuclear power (or renovation to practically the same extent as new), but instead go for wind and solar did not cause outages and soaring prices. We know this because there was enough time between that shift and the 2022 war to see the difference. In fact the minimal cost of marginal electricity production from wind and solar pushed prices down. What increased electricity prices in 2022 was the lack of cheap gas and half the French reactors being idle for half a year. (So much for stable base load). And the main problem for German industry isn’t even electricity prices, it’s gas as a direct input in industrial processes. >>>>Americans have lied about a Venmo glitch to avoid paying the bill. Not saying that is neccessarily wrong….but all these “polling” stories, irrespective of “conclusion”, need to be taken with an **extreme** grain of salt unless conducted by a reputable pollster. There is a cottage industy of lazy market research and polling—-relying on paid, online respondents. (garbage in, garbage out) naturally since it’s paid, the respondent pool skews to self-identifying as wealthy—as few paid polls involving research the non-comfortable. see amy survey, especially touted by a non-authoritative or tabloid outlet (NY Post)….be skeptical! My bank doesn’t allow Venmo transfers, for what it’s not worth. The article says it’s this one from Harris https://theharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Income-Paradox-Survey-November-2025.pdf. It doesn’t mention paying respondents. I thought it was an interesting read but otoh not really a surprise. I don’t think it would be hard to use up a 6-figure income on mortgage, kids, day care, cars, insurance, utilities, food and the rest. Also see Part 1: My Life Is a Lie by Michael Green, and IIRC has been previously linked at NC, in which he argues that the true poverty line for a family of four should be $140K per year for a family of four. Tangentially related, I was just listening to a New Yorker Radio Hour interview with Maine Senate candidate, Graham Platner, in which he claims he and his wife are getting by on $60K per year, which he says is only made possible by his having free healthcare from the VA. I haven’t listened to the interview. Maybe he’s giving a lot of his annual salary to his campaign, but U.S. Senators are paid $174,000 a year. “James Webb Space Telescope confirms 1st ‘runaway’ supermassive black hole rocketing through home galaxy at 2.2 million mph: ‘It boggles the mind!” Imagine a planet with an emerging sapient species. They go from discovering agricultural to being an industrial society in only 4,000 year. Eventually they put more and more resources into astronomy because one part of the sky looks weird. And eventually they work out that it is because a supermassive black hole is heading directly for them and there is not a damn thing to be done. What sort of effect would that have on an intelligent species? And for all we know, this could be happening right now. there was a story arc in Stargate Universe about just that…nd im too scatterbrained, atm…but i do recall a couple of Star Trek episodes and at least one Arthur C Clarke story regarding this scenario. lol, prob. thinking of the Star Trek Voy episode where the Voyager is an anomaly in a time-accelerated planet….and Voyager causes a scientific explosion on said planet. (The Doctor also fathers a kid, random unexplored plot point) That episode is based on a short story….and in classic literary style, there is a debate of the Voyager story is an homage, or an outright rip-of And that is all I can remember without resorting to the internet. and IIRC, this type of plot point is almost commo enough to be labeled a sci-fi trope? Know the episode that you mean as it was one of their finest in story telling. It was called “Blink of an Eye”- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blink_of_an_Eye_(Star_Trek:_Voyager) I liked how in each era they were at the same place that starts off a hill with a shrine to the gods until it is eventually overlooking an advanced city. You guys might enjoy the following Netflix video which is kinda along the same lines- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGEUv6CCPM (3:46 mins) It really does boggle the mind. I got stuck with acute boggling twice just in the first sentence. First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun. That’s about 10^5 astronomucal units (AU), i.e. 100,000 times the distance of the Earth from the sun. For comparison, the orbit of Neptune is about 60 AU. This black hole is about the size of the Oort cloud is theorized to be. Second, “rocketing through space at a staggering 2.2 million miles per hour”. What does that mean? In first year physics at Edinburgh we got an introduction to Special Relativity class and since then I have never been comfortable with the notion of astronomical speed or velocity. I can deal with quantifying the relative movent of two things but I don’t understand the speed of one thing in space. Is space itself a thing we can measure the speed of something else against? And that speed they said, 1000 km/s. For comparison, the speed of light is only 300 times that. But yeah, whatever that means, if you think human violence is bad, or even measured against what some imagine god might do to punish us, the scale and power of this speedy SMBH boggles. “First, this black hole is “10 million times larger than the sun”. I guess that means they estimate the diameter of its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun.” OTOH, they could mean that the *mass* of that black hole is 10 million times the mass of our sun. Which I think is more likely, but I haven’t read the article. I considered that but then I think they should have used a word other than “larger”. However, assuming you’re right, the Schwarzschild radius for 10 million solar masses, according to Wolfram Alpha, is 295.3 10^8, only 42 times larger than the sun, or about 0.1974 AU, which fits inside the orbit of Mercury. *only* “its event horizon at about 10^7 x the diameter of the sun” The mass of this black hole is about 10 million times the sun not 10 million times larger. https://astronomyexplained.com/how-big-are-black-holes/#google_vignette “The supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy Messier 87 (M87) gained significant attention in 2019. In 2019, the Event Horizon Telescope took the first image of its shadow. With a mass estimated to be 6.5 billion times that of the Sun, this supermassive black hole has a size comparable to the solar system.” So comparing physical size of the sun to a black hole has to take in the difference in density. Think of a lead ball compared to a styrofoam ball. Well, now I’m boggling again. 6.5 billion solar masses gives M87’s SMBH a 128.3 AU event horizon radius. I’m no physicist but am puzzled by the assertion in the story that this thing is generating a shock-wave ahead of itself, given that a) its supergravity would surely attract anything towards it as soon as any influence is felt and, b) it’s travelling in a vacuum so what would transmit any shockwave forward? Somewhere in the Universe it probably is. Aren’t we in that same thought experiment with our own heat death? Cassandras and skeptics. Venezuela tanker: “But the vessel boarded on Saturday, called the Centuries, is not on a list of entities under U.S. sanctions that is publicly maintained by the Treasury Department. The people inside Venezuela’s oil industry said the cargo belongs to an established China-based oil trader with a history of taking Venezuelan crude oil to Chinese refineries.” https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/20/us/politics/us-coast-guard-venezuela-oil-tanker.html Pirating Chinese oil seems like something that could have some sort of international fallout but who knows anymore. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. You should read the Homeland Security tweet- ‘Homeland Security @DHSgov PREPARE TO BE BOARDED. This morning @USCG in coordination with the @DeptofWar executed a lightning strike operation to seize the Motor Tanker Centuries, which is suspected of carrying oil subject to U.S. sanctions. The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.’ https://xcancel.com/DHSgov/status/2002493812976095249 Arrgghhhh, me maties. Good thing that they did not drag China into all this as they won’t sit down and take it. Oh wait… It’s all so very Ragnar Danneskjöld, this piracy on the high seize… Does everything have to follow the plot in Atlas Shrugged? Reads like some teen bragging about his videogame wins. Surprised they didn’t spell it “Rulz the waves”. Also, I’m no history expert but wasn’t “iron fist” what Stalinist Russia was labelled? Wow our military is bragging about taking over a non-military vessel You guys look like idiots Actually the Coast Guard, which I have a hard time equating with “the military,” although I guess they really are. I don’t recall ever seeing a report that they brutalized the crews of the vessels they seize. Say China (or Russia), sinks a third of the u.s. navy in one fell swoop. I’m wondering if Americans would “rally around the flag” or condemn the current administration for negligence. In that event, to hide our shame and embarrassment at having been defeated by the commie Chinese horde of lesser humans, we’d resort to our own “Samson option”. Because if no one is around to write about a defeat, then it didn’t happen. That’s really dark. Dark but accurate. This is why even after all this the opponents to empire continue to hang separately. Samsonite Option or American Tourister Option? I’d expect Russia and China to arrange a “freedom of navigation” exercise in Caribbean Sea in the very near future. And I doubt it will escalate beyond that. Maybe a joint Russia-China task force sailing between Cuba and Florida then? Can you imagine the panic? We lost our minds over a balloon. https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3288543/f-22-safely-shoots-down-chinese-spy-balloon-off-south-carolina-coast/ Heh heh, yes we did. Very interesting hypothetical that gives you an idea of how much fun it is to be Putin or Xi these days. It has seemed to me that Putin and Lavrov have been trying to conduct an intervention for power and violence addicts since Munich ’07, but now it’s more like cornering a rabid dog. That answers Joe Biden’s question from SOTU that year… “The iron fist of America’s joint military and federal law enforcement rules the waves.” The messages continue to shock and scare me despite preceding insanity. I won’t make the obvious points, ie. 1. What Federal Law was this tanker in breach of? 2. Federal Jurisdiction is limited to territorial waters only. After all, the US has joyfully regressed to its Wild West childhood where the man with the biggest gun wins, as long as it’s John Wayne. There never seem to be any consequences for US actions internationally. Well, not necessarily immediate consequences, but if we entertain the Mahanian idea of the USA being a Sea Power (as in dependent of secure sea lines), deteriorating the the trade security in the proximity of the North American continent may have certain long term repercussions. If naval conflicts replace the “Pax Americana” in places the Multipolar Stability (between agreement capable nations) can’t reach, US may learn about autarky at an accelerated pace. There never seem to be any immediate consequences for US actions internationally. Fixed it for ya! I would say BRICS and the rise of a multipolar world is a consequence of America’s actions. A world responding to decades of senseless wars. The more immediate problem is the neocons are very likely to get the war they so desperately desire despite the fact that the neocon wars America has conducted over the last couple of decades have done a huge number on the US military. Sometimes I cannot help but feel that the whole neocon bit for the last forty years has been a plot to wreck America, mostly because it seems to have worked.

Frankly wasting the ink to produce 113 pages of big black blocks is the Trump regime mocking people. At least the entire Epstein saga is finished and closed and nobody will ever talk of it again, especially during the midterms. Please Rev Kev, Think of the revenue stream with all those black Sharpies utilized! Disagree on the Epstein saga being over. Trump is still falling, and as the fall picks up speed the Epstein matter will come back. It’s too radioactive to die anytime soon. For either party. Based on knowns, the fallout will be felt far more among the Dems. Bubba is front and center, and doesn’t have the benefit of Epstein’s own attorney and many witnesses attesting to lack of scandalous involvement for Trump. Bubba likely will be joined by a lot of celebrities in the hot seat. Also count on many from both sides of the aisle and from academia and media. The full scope of the espionage and blackmail may never be known, but more spotlights on DC, Cambridge and elsewhere are welcome. Now, pray for the children victimized as their experiences will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Bubba is front and center because Trump was redacted and he wasn’t that of a big deal, politically and power wise speaking… Me thinks Rev Kev was being sarcastic ;-) Could be wrong, though. Perhaps AI can “fill in” the redacted text? Might make for some interesting denials from team Trump. Re the Iran/water story–talk about burying the lead. This is the final para. Politically, the country’s ambition for food security through self-reliance needs to be rethought, hydrologists say. There is simply not enough water to achieve it in the long run. Madani and others call for farmers to switch from growing thirsty staple crops such as rice to higher-value, less water-intensive crops that can be sold internationally in exchange for staples. But that requires Iran to lose its current political status as an international pariah and rejoin the global trading community. Given the heavy Israeli thumb on all of Iran’s international relations clearly the implied path for sanctions removal would be to bring back the reign of the Shahs who, as the article admits, also had more than a little to do with aquifer pumping and other environmental mistakes. One might also point out that the Cadillac Desert problem is prominent in our own Southwest with politically powerful agricultural incumbents being a factor. …rejoin the global trading community. Does the writer know that Iran joined BRICS+ two years ago? It’s 36% of the global community by GDP PPP and 46% by population. 3 of the world top food producing countries are members, too. So maybe, just maybe, Iran is a enough of a member of the global trading community? All in all, I think it was a decent article, especially on the technical points. Like almost everything on Iran in Western or Gulf Arab media though, there’s a strand of concern-trolling running through the whole thing that omits a lot. Besides the sanctions issue you mention: 1. The author brings up that the qanats are centuries old (some millennia), but implies they’ve been mostly damaged / neglected recently. My understanding is most of the old qanat network was degraded irreversibly during the Mongol invasions, partly out of direct destruction, partly out of lack of maintenance. Even after the Mongols, Iran’s population was less urbanized and so much smaller (it didn’t recover fully until the 1950s) that rebuilding a new network was never really feasible. 2. So new qanats today often have to be built from scratch, and what he doesn’t mention, is that you can’t really build them anywhere. You need just the right topography and springs in the right place relative to a population center. Like he does mention, they can also only provide a certain level of flow. With a large population under siege, the hard choice is to pull more water now with pumped wells, try to limit consumption downstream, and hopefully do things more sustainably once they’ve reached a strategic / economic stage closer to China or Russia (probably 1 more generation out). 3. I’m not a hydrologist, but IIUC many of the dams he mentions running almost empty were designed with that in mind. The Iranian government trains a lot of hydrologists, it does pay attention to climate models, and in particular, I think it expects a lot more extreme precipitation events around a drier average. The dams are staggered up in the highlands to retain water from wet / snowy years, not with any expectation of being close to full on average. 4. It still seems like way too many people haven’t realized that the Iranian government wants as many people to (gradually) abandon Tehran as possible. They aren’t going to plow their budget into saving a city they’ve already written off. Everyone assumes it’s going to be whacked with a giant earthquake eventually, plus it’s built right up against the Alborz so the air quality will never be great (imagine Boise during an inversion if 10 million people tried living there). And that’s before you get into all the weird cultural aspects of how the city relates to the rest of the country. File under Bondi Beach and narrative control.

He must really know what he is doing (and saying). That he got his wealth by hook and crook, and whether he believes in his own drivel is irrelevant; the governments that subsidize his endeavours, the public buying shares in them, the consumers acquiring the junk his firms produce, the press and other pundits transported into states of ectasy at his pronouncements — these are the true imbeciles. Agreed. If he’s an idiot (and he seemingly is) what does that say about everyone else? Same could be said about Trump. He’s clearly a dullard but apparently a slick salesman can climb their way to the top. We are truly a society of marks. I often think back to the NFT/Metaverse craze a few years ago. Was at SXSW in 2022 and it was like being at a massive cult rally as the KoolAid was being passed around. The bottom was already dropping out but everyone was spewing buzzwords, minting coins, and speaking abstractly about the new frontier they were pioneering. I thought, just maybe, in all the talks about presentations I’d garner a hint at some sort of tangible application for any of it but walked away from that experience certain of nothing but how empty it all was. Just hype and faith. But, one thing that seems to draw in legions of diehard acolytes is confident hype. People swoon to that like moths to a flame. I’ll never understand it. Anyone that speaks to me with unbridled confidence repels me like a used car salesman. But it works on the vast majority of humanity it seems. I don’t claim to be smarter than others, I just don’t like salesmen/preacher types. I prefer people who see the complexity of the world and doubt their own grasp of it. Yes, that is why this guy says this is and is not an AI bubble at the same time. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kh3d43DlBOU OpenAI and Xai are cults. I’ve dodged a metaphorical bullet by missing out on big tech jobs a decade or more ago. Watched friends and colleagues go to them. Facebook, Atlassian, slack, google. you don’t get hired, last or thrive in places like that if you question the orthodoxy or show signs of skepticism. they all know what game they’re playing – “big number get bigger”. might as well look for another job if you question it. the sad thing is they don’t always start that way. plenty of moral, ambitious, startups with talented curious skeptical people in them. but those start ups get absorbed by the tech-finance borg and… I think the country has always been like that, but there was a transition in corporate CEOs from engineering background to sales background to finance background. Where once competition was for things like market share, now it’s stock price, a measure far more removed from reality than whether the public likes the design, price and reliability of your cars. And if it’s even worse now, I wonder if it’s not an effect of the existential fear that I believe is creeping in on “little cat feet” throughout Western society. I hear people from my Millennial son to my Boomer friends talk about cutting themselves off from the news in order to avoid the anxiety and dread that seem to be building in the old “West” because of a combination social dissolution, economic instability, international chaos and an increasingly enraged Earth. Do we believe at some level that the confidence man must know something because somebody, somewhere must know something. Otherwise, it’s pretty hard to escape the conclusion that we’re screwed. Another thing I’ve observed about some “normie” types is that they’re desperate for some authority they can rely on. Some resort to traditional religion, the more conservative the better. Some bow the knee to Science as KLG discussed here. Technology and the Progress Myth may even be displacing Science as the sand upon which our society is built, so in such times as these, the Tech huckster has plenty of desperate marks. Yes an idiot. Being born wealthy and then being at the right time, right place takes no intelligence. And the real reason for his wealth, achieving TechBro cult status, he fell into. None of that was planned, and he just believes his own BS. I would add that from my brief time running with some rich and powerful (albeit on a much much lower rung of the ladder), they know so little about tech, and are even intimidated by it, so are incredibly easy to baffle and impress with bull$h1t when it comes to the areas Musk is in. It’s always felt like a lot of his success has been due to sounding intelligent to those who don’t know any better and them having FOMO if he turns out to be right. Astrophysicist and author, Adam Becker, in his book More Everything Forever, provides incisive, science based proofs as to the idiocy of Musk’s Martian fever dreams and other lunacies from Silicon Valley’s best and brightest.

Love it, Wuk. And when that song came out, I was a 14 year-old Midwest teenager wishing I was old enough to drive to check it out. Surely it was a mix of good and bad, but there were things happening like the Monterey Pop Festival, the Be-In, the Houseboat Summit and the kool-aid acid tests that I would like to have seen or participated in. Just the bands that were playing at the Fillmore or Monterey would have been amazing to see as they were forming and evolving. It would have been a different route. More New Buffalo Communes and fewer Waymos. Maybe your Burning Man, Wuk, preserves some part of that, but it seems to me we’re a lot closer to Dick’s and Scott’s vision of the future than the 60s San Francisco that MacKenzie was writing about. And I’ll throw in an Animals’ tune along the same lines. British bluesmen could dig the Summer of Love along with Americans. Thanks HMP, that song was crying out to be rearranged~ One thing about the 60’s is that money seemed to be irrelevant in all goings on, you could see a concert with 5 really good bands for a few bucks in the SF Bay area. Burning Man costs a bit for entry ticket and parking pass, and then money becomes ballast, in that the only thing you can buy on the playa is bags of ice, that’s it. So, it has some of that 60’s vibe going on, art for the sake of enjoyment-not enrichment. So Kagi came out with a game to help kids detect AI slop.

This Christmas it was a no, unfortunately. I had enough trouble just getting my gifts selected and purchased. I still have a few to go. Cards?!!??? remain beyond me yet another Christmas. I have not received any Christmas cards but I will send some next year if I can get my act together. I still send out some Solstice cards as I have for a half century I don’t send them out to get one back, just like making them and sending them out. For all of the attempts to destroy it, the USPS is still a great service. Denmark has solved that problem. You cannot send letters there anymore and they have removed all their mailboxes. You wanna send a Christmas card, send an email. But around here I noticed something more prosaic. Over the recent decades as friends and family pass away there is less and less people to send Christmas cards to so this year there are only a handful to send. Nobody told me that that would ever happen but I guess that it is inevitable. Same here. Many of the older generation I used to send cards to has passed on. The better half has decided we will switch to sending very pretty PDFs of Christmas cards that she designs. I really enjoyed watching the video embedded at the top of the links showing a traditional egg decorating technique. Thanks for sharing that. I also enjoyed the video. The work shown was amazingly precise showing the great skill of the person creating the egg. It looked like something to start practicing for next year’s Christmas. Technically the traditional egg decoration is for the Easter (spring, resurrection etc). Nothing really preventing one from doing for Christmas, though.

I’m speechless. I bet Xi is pissed. No magnets for Xmass… A drop in church attendance preceded the opioid epidemic: “Long before opioids flooded communities, something else was quietly changing—and it may have helped set the stage for today’s crisis. A new study finds that as church attendance dropped among middle-aged, less educated white Americans, deaths from overdoses, suicide, and alcohol-related disease began to rise. The trend started years before OxyContin appeared, suggesting the opioid epidemic intensified a problem already underway.” https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/12/251219093317.htm Maybe some independent factor caused both the drop in attendance and the opioid epidemic. Or maybe a fair number of people are better off attending church than not, no matter how wart-ridden the church inevitably is or what they believe. I’m not sure how one would set up a study to determine which it is. I would add that too many of the preachers in these congregations served neither to educate their parishioners to some of the realities of their existence nor did they advocate publicly for their interests. Instead, many of their preachers reinforced the status quo that was crushing these people with their preaching and considered themselves upstanding members of their local communities in terms of their memberships and friendships. First, the church often left them. Losing that membership in the community may well have been an important contributor to the epidemic. It wasn’t weekly exposure to the preaching of fire and brimstone. Spiritual Fitness Inventory User Guide US Army Public Health Command, Technical Guide No. 360 [2012] Even if a particular church left people, they could have still gone to a different church, or formed a new one. In many denominations the members choose their own pastor (or in the case of my denomination, have no paid pastor; everyone is a pastor). I’m not convinced that the cause was bad pastors. It seems like a little much to expect some one person to “educate” parishioners to the realities of their existence; I wouldn’t expect that of a pastor even if my denomination had them. I’m just not sure why people stopped attending. In my part of the country I did see social snobbery being a factor; religion was seen as being for the uneducated. Lack of community and peer to peer support in a world of neoliberalism and unaffordable or underfunded social services is a recipe for disaster. I don´t sympathize with that claim at least at its face value. There were also anecdotes where in the light of lacking support from state (as DEA colluded with Purdue) victims turned to church where prayers were supposed to solve the problem of addiction! The thing that did the trick was organizing and the FBI connecting the dots, to my knowledge. That doesn´t mean “church” doesn´t help in certain context. But then “church” is just the representation for something else. Call it solidarity, call it community organising, local social services. It´s risky to think religion helps where in fact it is serious shortcomings and corruption in rich societies. In fact Purdue abused such indicators as poverty or “decency” to claim why victims of Oxy had become addicted. NOT actually Oxy. That´s is not unlike claiming “well it´s all due to the loss of values that our kids are taking drugs”. i.e. it´s their fault. The less solidarity in a society because its dismantled by its elites the more religion is supposed to step in. Eventually an Emmanuel Todd says that the demise of religion is directly connectet with the demise of societies. I.don´t.think.so. Forgive me but to cease this dependency on religion as it was established in the Soviet system was progressive achievement. (it was other issues that didn´t work.) Thanks for the link. From the article: “The researchers found a clear pattern at the state level. States that experienced the sharpest drops in church attendance between 1985 and 2000 also saw the largest increases in deaths from these causes during the same period.” Now what else was happening in the US during that time period – 1985 to 2000? My very first thought is that was when the big push to move factory jobs offshore or from northern states more expensive labor to southern states less expensive labor, the difference being the rate of factory labor unionization between northern and southern states. Moving manufacturing to Mexico and Vietnam and later to China. People were told to move from places like Detroit and Dearborn to places where the work was. Or told to accept lower wages or the company would move the factory jobs to another state or to another country. Either accept lower wages or quit and ‘learn to code’. Working class people were economically whipsawed by this threat for many years. People were uprooted, displaced, financially distressed, and moving into a new community when feeling desperate, maybe a second or third move, could I imagine leave one in a state of turmoil. Finding a new church to attend and join might have been the last thing on the mind if wondering just how long one might live in the new city. Shorter, it started during the Reagan years of outsourcing and downsizing that put families on the move looking for work. / my 2 cents And putting too fine a point on this, I’m thinking of the US’s internal great migration of farmers and farm labor, dispossessed of their farms and labor during the Great Depression, on a constant move looking for work. I don’t think many of them looked to join a new church during those terrible years when they were on the move. No stability, no knowing how long they’d be in any place if they did find work. Dorothea Lange made a series of famous photos for the Farm Security Administration in FDR’s administration. You’d recognize the pictures. Search on the term “Dorothea Lange”. But church attendance dropped among people who stayed put. And it dropped in areas like my home region of New England that weren’t affected in the same way by Reaganomics. And it used to be that when people moved to a new area the first thing they did was look for a church for support. I agree about the badness of Reagonomics and its dislocations but I think there may be something more. Pretty sure Space X gets a tax wright off for the CyberTrucks. That will be some form 179. Here I was wrestling with the older eurovans clocking in below 6K GVW. It’s all a matter of scale, no? With Elroy, it is almost also like a stock-buy-back. My bet: He got a discount-to-MSRP ro deal, books the sale, never pays a penny, sells to Guvvy for their Venezuelan ground transpo at 150 % of MSRP (Military Pro deal) , but graciously throws in solar charge stations. So many headlines to anticipate for 2026!! Maybe that will offset the cost of exploding rockets. / heh. RE: Roomba’s and ebikes. . . Rad ebikes dominate the ebike category in my town. They start at $1k for the model parents are buying for their kids (as young as 9 y.o.). The town council has now created administrative fines for the reckless riding the youngsters create. The fines are payable by the parents. Needless to say this market for ebikes is shrinking. Older adults buy the more expensive models, but after less than a year realize an ebike is the prey for distracted automobile drivers. One local dealer told me that 40% of buyers want help selling their purchase in the first year of ownership. (I own an expensive Class 3 ebike that is stored in the City run Bike Spot indoor parking; there are ebikes next to mine that have not been ridden in the last 6 months.) It’s not just the tariffs that are depressing the market. E-bikes are so dangerous in the hands of a kid or adult, as I see them rather silently almost keeping up with cagers, often in their blind spot. In Brooklyn they are known to burn down buildings due to off market chargers and lithium batteries. There’s a reason why some people don’t park their Tesla in the garage. It does seem I see fewer ebikes on my trails these days. And on the street even motorcycles are quite dangerous because of the visibility problem. “They graduated from Stanford. Due to AI, they can’t find a job – Los Angeles Times” This is a complete farce. AI is not replacing people. AI is not responsible for new grads being unable to find tech jobs. It’s Indians. Indians and other mass migrants via fraudulent visas. This is congruent with the adage that AI means “Actually, Indians”. Ukraine Receives Last of 80 Promised Abrams Tanks: How Many Are Left and How Well Can They Be Sustained? Military Watch I’m calling bullshit. No-one is signing off sending 80 $25 million turbine powered tanks to be obliterated by 200 $1500 drones within 96 hours. The total budget for the endless drone destruction music videos and edits over the next 5 years remixes won’t even exceed the paperwork budget for shipping this many tanks into Ukraine. It makes more sense to relegate the tanks to bulldozer duty behind the lines than to do this. Probably they are being shipped somewhere else, or being sold by the Ukrainians to someone else, or are for conquering Poland. I simply cannot believe even the Nato MIC would send this much (relatively) good hardware in after bad. I doubt that those tanks are for the present conflict. Instead, they will be the nucleus of a more powerful tank force for the Ukrainian army that will be built up after the Russians sign Minsk 3. Then when NATO gets its planned 2030 war against Russia, they will be at the forefront of the new attack against the Russians. Now we just need to have the Russians cooperate more… re: Protonmail leaves Switzerland use google-tranlsate Proton leaves Switzerland: CEO warns of surveillance state https://tarnkappe.info/artikel/it-sicherheit/datenschutz/proton-verlaesst-die-schweiz-ceo-warnt-vor-ueberwachungsstaat-324338.html “Proton has begun relocating its infrastructure from Switzerland. Servers are being operated in parallel in Germany and Norway, systems are being mirrored, and preparations are being made for a worst-case scenario. Should the Swiss Federal Act on the Surveillance of Postal and Telecommunications Traffic (VÜPF) come into force in its planned form, Proton could shut down its Swiss servers at short notice. The company is also taking personnel measures and creating jobs outside of Switzerland. That Proton is even considering this step is remarkable. The company was founded in Switzerland, emerging from the CERN environment, and deliberately remained there for years because of the strong rule of law and high data protection standards. Yen now sees precisely these standards as being under threat.” Thanks. Helpful info. re: NATO was the root cause Former Biden National Security Advisor for Europe, Amanda Sloat “admitted” to those two Russian pranksters that NATO expansion to UKR was the major cause for the war. This is reported by Responsible Statecraft by Branko Marcetic. I am a bit surprised since I could never regard this pranking as a 100% sincere source for such an “admission”. That is entertainment, not schoalrship or journalism. But I guess these are simply the new times and I am getting old. Pranked Biden official exposes lie that Ukraine war was inevitable She isn’t the first to admit — after the fact — that taking NATO off the table to avoid Russian invasion was considered, and dismissed https://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-nato-sloat/ However Jeffrey Sachs too quoted Amanda Sloat but not in the context of the prank but in form of a private admission/comment to him (the same way Jake Sullivan in 2021 admitted to Sachs that he could not say something particular in public.) see TC 17:50 https://glenndiesen.substack.com/p/jeffrey-sachs-an-open-letter-to-chancellor Here is my question: Are the prank and Sachs´s story connected or are the coincidences? Western society is rotten In the past, guns were used to protect rackets, and shootings were a measure of “last resort,” he said, whereas today, “the slightest disrespect can lead to a 30-man shootout.” “Civilians are getting killed and struck, which was not only unseen and unheard-of, it was a big no-no,” Mr. Wilson said. As U.S. Guns Pour Into Canada, the Bodies Pile Up (NY Times) The proliferation of illegal firearms from the United States has fueled a spike in gun violence in Canada, where most guns used in crimes are smuggled across the border.
