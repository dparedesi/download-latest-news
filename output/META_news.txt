ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. The stock and cryptocurrency market comeback from the tariff crash was in full swing Thursday, as President Donald Trump expanded investors’ risk appetite. Stocks have recovered all of their "Liberation Day" losses and then some. You better go out and buy stock now,” Trump said Thursday from the Oval Office. That direct encouragement accelerated an equity market rally which began as the president showed further inclination to back off of his most aggressive trade war plans and brandished a new trade deal with the U.K., the first such agreement of his second term. All three primary barometers of the U.S. stock market surged to multi week highs, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit its highest level since April 2, the S&P 500 notched its top price since March 27 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq touched its highest level since March 26. The Dow rose 570 points, or 1.4%, by early afternoon, while the S&P climbed 1.4% and the Nasdaq popped 1.8%. Trump’s encouragement to buy stocks mirrored his messaging ahead of the 90-day pause he placed last month on the most aggressive of his country-by-country tariffs. Digital assets rode optimism of trade war deescalation to solid gains, as the three most valuable tokens – bitcoin, ether and XRP – each rose at least 3.9% in the 24-hour period ending midday Thursday. Bitcoin, by far the most valuable crypto asset, topped $100,000 for the first time since Feb. 4 during the rally. All but one of the S&P’s 13 sectors gained Thursday, but it was the “magnificent seven” grouping of big tech companies championing the rally. Shares of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla were all up at least 0.8%, led by Tesla’s 4% gain, as the growth-focused septet enjoyed Wall Street’s move to risk. Bloomberg’s index tracking the seven stock rose 2%. The S&P tallied its longest winning streak in 21 years from April 22 through last Friday, erasing what was a 12% loss from April 2 through April 8 as Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs wreaked havoc. The benchmark is still down 7% from its February peak. The bounce comes even as Trump engages in a stare down with the U.S.’ top monetary policy official, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The Fed declined to lower interest rates this week as it waits to see further evidence of how Trump’s tariffs will work their way through the economy, much to Trump’s dismay. Trump called Powell a “fool” and Thursday likened speaking with the central banker like “talking to a wall.”

Title: Mark Zuckerberg announces mind-control

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Mark Zuckerberg has told investors how he plans to make back the tens of billions he's spending on AI: he's going to use it to make advertisements that can bypass our critical faculties and convince anyone to buy anything. In other words, Meta will make an AI mind-control ray and rent it out to grateful advertisers. Here, Zuck is fulfilling the fundamental duty of every CEO of every high-growth tech company: explaining how his company will continue to grow. These growth stories are key, because growth stocks trade at a huge premium relative to the stocks of "mature" companies. Every dollar Meta brings in boosts their share price to a much greater degree than the dollars earned by companies with similar rates of profit, but slower rates of growth. This premium represents a bet by investors that Meta will continue to grow, which means that the instant Meta stops growing, the value of its shares will plummet, to reflect the fact that it is a "mature" company, not a "growth" company. So Zuck needs to do everything he can to keep investors believing that Meta will continue to grow. After all, Zuck's key employees and top managers all take much (or even most!) of their compensation in Meta stock, which means that the instant the company stops growing, those workers' pay will plummet and they will seek employment elsewhere, depriving Meta of the workers it needs to successfully create or conquer a new market and once again become a growth stock. This is why Zuck keeps telling stories. The most important story Zuck tells is about himself, the boy genius who converted a tool for nonconsensually rating the fuckability of Harvard undergrads into a social media monopoly with four billion users. Zuck's cult of personality isn't the product of mere narcissism – it's a tool for creating the material conditions for ongoing investor confidence: https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-shirt-latin-what-does-it-say-explained-words-2024-9 If Zuck is a boy genius, then Zuck's pronouncements take on the character of prophesy. When Zuck announced the "pivot to video," investors poured tens of billions into Facebook stock and into video-first online news production, despite the fact that Zuck was obviously lying: https://slate.com/technology/2018/10/facebook-online-video-pivot-metrics-false.html The "boy genius" story is an example of Silicon Valley's storied "reality distortion field," pioneered by Steve Jobs. Like Jobs, Zuck is a Texas marksman, who fires a shotgun into the side of a barn and then draws a target around the holes. Jobs is remembered for his successes, and forgiven his (many, many) flops, and so is Zuck. The fact that pivot to video was well understood to have been a catastrophic scam didn't stop people from believing Zuck when he announced "metaverse." Zuck lost more than $70b on metaverse, but, being a boy genius Texas marksman, he is still able to inspire confidence from credulous investors. Zuck's AI initiatives generated huge interest in Meta's stock, with investors betting that Zuck would find ways to keep Meta's growth going, despite the fact that AI has the worst unit economics of any tech venture in living memory. AI is a business that gets more expensive as time goes on, and where the market's willingness to pay goes down over time. This makes the old dotcom economics of "losing money on every sale, but making it up in volume" look positively rosy: https://www.wheresyoured.at/reality-check/ Now, Zuck has finally described how he's going to turn AI's terrible economics around: he's going to ask AI to design his advertisers' campaigns, and these will be so devastatingly effective that advertisers will pay a huge premium to advertise on Meta: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-ai-revolution-is-an-advertising-revolution-morning-brief-100001467.html This narrative is especially galling because it's literally the same story Zuck has been telling for decades: "Facebook has built a mind-control ray out of Big Data, and we can sell anything to anyone": https://pluralistic.net/2021/09/30/dont-believe-the-criti-hype/#ordinary-mediocrities This is a facially absurd proposition. After all, everyone who's ever claimed to have perfected mind-control – Rasputin, Mesmer, MK-ULTRA, neurolinguistic programming grifters and pathetic "pick up artists" – was a liar. Either they were lying to themselves, or to everyone else. Or both. But many of tech's critics helped sell this narrative (and thus helped Meta sell ads). Many critics have fallen prey to the sin of "criti-hype," Lee Vinsel's term for critiquing the claims of your adversary without bothering to ask whether they are true: https://pluralistic.net/2021/02/02/euthanize-rentiers/#dont-believe-the-hype The project of convincing investors that tech's "dopamine hackers" had perfected mind-control with warmed over, non-replicable Skinnerian behavior-mod techniques and mass surveillance sold a hell of a lot of ads. After all, if there's one kind of person the advertising sector has always been able to sell to, it's advertising executives, who are the easiest of marks for a story about how easy it is to trick the public into buying whatever you're selling: https://pluralistic.net/2020/10/05/florida-man/#wannamakers-ghost Every ad-tech sales-bro who takes a meeting with an advertising executive finds himself pushing on an open door. Advertisers desperately wants to believe in mind-control rays. Think of the department store magnate John Wannamaker, who said, "half my advertising spending is wasted – I just don't know which half." Imagine: some advertising exec convinced John Wannamaker that he was only wasting half of his advertising spending! I've long maintained that the threat from AI to workers isn't that AI can do your job – it's that an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job: https://pluralistic.net/2025/03/18/asbestos-in-the-walls/#government-by-spicy-autocomplete The corollary here is that it doesn't matter if AI can design ads that work, not so long as an AI ad salesman can sell this proposition to an advertisers, and not so long as a tech CEO can sell it to investors. AI keeps passing the worst kinds of Turing tests – for example, it's great at helping people who are prone to life-destroying hallucinations that they are talking to God: https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ai-spiritual-delusions-destroying-human-relationships-1235330175/ Zuck kept up his growth story with this mind control narrative for more than a decade, got caught committing a string of spectacular frauds, and then lured investors back into his stock offerings by telling the same story. This isn't just an indictment of Zuck, it's a stinging rebuke to the whole idea that markets are a kind of infallible computer for assessing and operationalizing information. The market's "thought process" demonstrably lacks the object permanence that most babies acquire by the time they are a year old. You can tell when your child has acquired object permanence by the fact that they cease to enjoy "peek-a-boo" (object permanence means they understand where you have gone when your face is hidden). In claiming that AI will give him an infinite growth mind-control ray, Mark Zuckerberg is challenging the market to a game of peek-a-boo – and he's winning.

Title: AI engines are starting to challenge Google's search dominance

Happy almost Friday! Some good news this morning: A cheap, widely-prescribed diabetes drug is showing some promise in preventing colon cancer. In today's big story, Google's stock tanked after an Apple exec said AI engines are starting to challenge the search engine's dominance. If you haven't subscribed to our new newsletter Tech Memo, what are you waiting for? What's on deck Markets: Trump teases first 'major trade deal' — and it's set to be with the UK. Tech: Big Tech is all about rewarding its stars and getting rid of everyone else. Business: People are fed up with companies' 'bait and switch pricing.' But first, can you Google ChatGPT this? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. AI giveth, and AI taketh. Google seems to be learning that the hard way, as the new tech is gaining ground on one of its crown jewels. Apple executive Eddy Cue said searches on its Safari browser shrank for the first time last month, and he's pointing the finger at AI engines, writes BI's Peter Kafka. Cue also said AI tools like OpenAI and Perplexity AI would eventually supplant traditional search engines, and Apple will offer them to Safari users in the future. Google investors took the news hard, with shares dropping more than 8% on Wednesday. Cue has a vested interest in Google's search business, since Google pays Apple at least $20 billion a year to make its search engine the default on the iPhone. Still, in theory, Apple might be able to replace some or all of that money with payments from the OpenAIs of the world. (Cue's comments came while testifying in the federal antitrust suit against Google's parent company, Alphabet. When it rains, it pours.) The AI boom obviously hasn't been all bad for Google. The interest in the tech gave it the green light to invest billions in new development. The results weren't always great, but it largely seems happy with the progress made on things like its AI Overviews. But as much as it tries to reshape itself, the progress made by its younger, smaller AI rivals is becoming undeniable. It's not just the new kids on the block enjoying the AI revolution. A very, very old player has newfound success leveraging AI. IBM is full speed ahead on its AI strategy, and Wall Street is eating it up, writes BI's Matthew Fox. The company's stock is up almost 15% this year, far outpacing the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100, which is down 5%. At its recent conference, CEO Arvind Krishna said its generative AI business is now worth $6 billion. IBM's focus is helping companies adopt AI, and has the added benefit of an open-source approach. That allows it to work with clients regardless of the AI tools they prefer, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told Matthew. (If you're looking for more tech coverage like this, subscribe to our upcoming tech newsletter Tech Memo. Alistair Barr will be running the show, and he does a much better job of covering tech than me.) 1. Trump's first post-tariffs trade deal. The White House is expected to announce a trade deal with the UK on Thursday. A Downing Street spokeswoman told BI that talks between the two countries had been "continuing at pace" and the Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, would provide an update later on Thursday. 2. No surprises from the Fed. The central bank held interest rates steady as expected, although Chairman Jerome Powell had faced calls from President Trump and members of his administration to lower them. Powell has stressed waiting to see how tariffs affect the economy. 3. Jefferies banker's death ruled an accident. Carter McIntosh, a 28-year-old associate, died of a toxic mix of drugs including fentanyl and cocaine, an autopsy revealed. His death in January sparked widespread backlash against the bank's work culture. 1. Big Tech has a new playbook. Tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are doubling down on performance-based rewards, with top performers receiving larger payouts and low performers facing the heat. Meanwhile, new-hire offers are being reduced. 2. How a meme empire is sliding into your DMs. The Instagram gold rush isn't in the grid anymore — it's in your DMs. Doing Things, the company that owns meme accounts like Overheard, told BI its strategy to get users to share its content. 3. Meet Valarian, a new addition from the Palantir mafia. The Palantir-alumni-founded startup wants to help governments and companies control their data and has plans to expand into the defense sector. Its current seed round has raised $20 million. 1. Pro-Tesla, anti-Musk. Working for Tesla was Matthew LaBrot's dream job, but he was fired after publishing a website protesting Elon Musk. In an interview with BI, he shared his concern for how the billionaire is affecting Tesla's brand and sales — and why he still believes in the company anyway. 2. Recession fears got nothing on Disney adults. They know a Disney vacation is pricey, but they're going anyway. Disney World visits are surging, US parks revenue soared last quarter, and soon, they'll have a new magical destination to add to the list: Abu Dhabi. 3. Does $19.95 to rent a U-Haul truck sound too good to be true? That's because it is. Companies are using "bait-and-switch" tactics to lure customers in with one price, only to tack on extra fees and make the total nowhere near what was initially expected. It's so common that customers often throw their hands up and pay anyway. Paramount, News Corp, Coinbase, and Lyft report earnings.

Title: What’s Happening With Arista Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDIA - 2023/12/14: In this photo illustration, the Arista Networks Inc. logo seen displayed on a ... More mobile phone screen with the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Despite posting impressive quarterly results, Arista Networks (NASDAQ: ANET) saw an unexpected market reaction. The company delivered solid numbers with sales reaching $2.0 billion (up 27.6% year-over-year) and adjusted earnings of $0.65 per share (up from $0.50 last year). Both figures beat Wall Street expectations of $1.97 billion in sales and $0.59 EPS. As an aside, will Tesla get back to basics? See Tesla’s Lost Cause. Adding to the good news, Arista’s Q2 outlook of $2.1 billion exceeded consensus estimates, and they announced a $1.5 billion share buyback program. Normally, these would be ingredients for a stock rally, but instead, ANET dropped 5% in after-hours trading. Clearly, ANET stock is volatile, and if you are looking for potential upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What’s Next For HIMS Stock After A Solid Q1? So what happened? Investors were clearly hoping for even more, especially considering major tech companies have maintained their AI-related capital expenditure plans. The question now: Does it make sense to buy ANET at $86 (after-hours price)? We think absolutely. At $86 (after market), ANET trades at 15x trailing revenues, just slightly above its three-year average P/S ratio of 14x. We believe a higher valuation multiple is justified given Arista’s strong position in the AI space, with companies like Meta, Microsoft, Oracle, and Google making up a significant portion of sales while remaining committed to AI expansion. With sales growth projected in the high teens over the next few years, the premium valuation makes sense. Bottom line: Investors should consider using this dip in ANET stock as an opportunity to buy for solid long-term gains. For investors aiming to reduce the inherent volatility associated with individual stocks like Arista Networks, there are alternative investment strategies available. The Trefis RV strategy, which has a history of outperforming its all-cap stock benchmark, provides a diversified approach to potentially achieve solid returns. Likewise, the High-Quality portfolio has shown superior performance compared to the S&P 500 with returns that exceed 91% since its initiation, offering potential upside with reduced stock-specific risk.

Title: Facebook stole my book to train its AI. The insult wasn't the money

Time Published: 2025-05-07T09:00:00Z
Full Content:
It started with an email from my literary agent. “You might’ve heard about LibGen and books being used to train AI,” she wrote. “A search of the database shows that Poe for Your Problems is on the list.” I had seen the headline, back in March, in The Atlantic: “Meta (META) pirated millions of books to train its AI,” it screamed. But to my shame, I hadn’t actually read the piece. I had been too busy writing for Quartz (as now) and chasing my four-year-old around the house. Life goes on, even when someone steals your intellectual property. Yet there it was. The story detailed how Meta employees had downloaded tens of gigabytes of pirated books from LibGen, a well-known “shadow library” that hosts roughly eight million titles. They used these files to help train LLaMA 3, the company’s most advanced language model. Internal discussions, unsealed earlier this year as part of an ongoing lawsuit, show that Meta’s engineers explicitly debated the legal risks and chose to proceed anyway, looking to save both time and money. The documents further suggest that top leadership signed off on the maneuver. “Eventually, the team at Meta got permission from ‘MZ’ — an apparent reference to Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — to download and use the data set,” The Atlantic reported. In response, a group of authors including Sarah Silverman have filed a class action lawsuit, now winding its way through the legal system. Instead, I was relieved. My little book had been deemed important enough to steal! Thank goodness. The greater shame would’ve been not being pirated, considering the scale of the theft. I turned to a friend who happened to be standing nearby and said, “It’s just nice to be included.” If that seems like a perverse reaction, well, it conveys how humbling it can be to achieve your lifelong author dreams. Many people dream of publishing a book someday — I had since I was eight years old — but becoming an author is a lesson in humility, at least in my experience. You show up at a bookstore to give a reading to five people, two of whom are your dad’s cousins. You do podcast interviews in which the host greets you with, “So I haven’t had time to read your book… can you remind me what it’s about and who you are?” Like I said: humbling. But the relief quickly curdled as I remembered what it had been like to sell the book in the first place. Nonfiction is sold on proposal — which means you don’t write the book, you write a 40-page business plan for the book. I spent years on mine, rewriting it three separate times. I got upwards of two dozen rejections before it finally went to auction and found a home with a Hachette subsidiary in 2019. After that, it took another year to write the actual book. When it came out in 2021, I spent thousands of hours promoting it. My advance was $20,000 — not nothing. But that was before taxes and my agent’s 15% cut. I once calculated that I’d earned less than the federal minimum wage for writing the book. Since it “earned out” in 2023 (meaning the publisher fully made back its costs), I’ve received another $10,000 in royalties. Those checks are always welcome, but they’re also pre-tax couch change compared to the time, energy, and ambition that went into the work. It’s hard to explain just how difficult it is to land a publishing deal, especially with one of the “Big Four.” Unless you’re an Obama or a Kardashian, it’s nearly impossible. Publishing is a perpetually precarious industry, surviving year to year on breakout hits like Atomic Habits or It Ends With Us. Even the largest publishers operate on net margins of about 6%. That doesn’t leave much room for risk. So they’re understandably reluctant to bet on an unproven author with an odd idea. I got around the issue of not being famous myself by writing about someone who was: my literary hero, Edgar Allan Poe. But that didn’t make things easy. Selling a self-help book based on the life of history’s most miserable writer was, perhaps unsurprisingly, an uphill battle. And while my genre — irreverent self-help, sometimes called “anti-self-help” — is relatively common now, it wasn’t when I was knocking on doors, metaphorical hat in hand. Putting together a convincing business case was hard enough. Writing the actual book — 55,000 words of deeply researched, counterintuitive argument — was harder still. “To coin one’s brain into silver, at the nod of a master, is to my thinking, the hardest task in the world,” Poe once wrote. It’s no less true when you’re the master, too. Today, Amazon sells my book for $12.99. My cut of that is $2.25. And that’s too steep a price tag for Meta? A company worth $1.5 trillion, helmed by a founder with a $200 billion net worth? Mark Zuckerberg owns about 13% of Meta stock. He could’ve paid me $2.25 — the amount I earn per sale — almost 89 billion times. Or he could’ve just bought a single copy, which would’ve cost him 0.0000011% of his wealth. Assuming a $20 sticker price on each of the 7.5 million pirated books, actually paying for all of them would’ve cost about $150 million — not even one-tenth of one percent of Zuckerberg’s fortune. Me? I would’ve come out $2.25 better. I could’ve bought a Snickers, depending on the gas station. Surely the world’s third-richest man could swing that. If you want to understand the artist’s dilemma in the AI age, it’s this: Do something singular, something that takes years of obsessive creative labor — then watch it get stolen by someone for whom $150 million is a rounding error. In that light, it’s not just theft. It’s bullying. Exploitation. Looting on a grand scale. The stuff of Upton Sinclair. Only we don’t have robber barons anymore. We have pirate captains. Bluebeards of the human heart. And what are we supposed to fight them with? Carefully worded emails? That’s like bringing a spork to a nuclear war. Some authors think publishers should be the ones leading the charge. “I checked one of the sites,” the novelist Domenica Ruta told me, “and yes, both my former books were used to train AI. I’m furious and feel utterly powerless about what to do. My take is that publishers — who absolutely have the resources — need to be the frontline defenders against this. They need to protect their authors and our work. As individuals we have little power. A Big Four publisher has a lot more influence.” When Facebook came to power and popularity circa 2010, we at least understood the bargain: In exchange for our data, we got to post above-average-cute photos of ourselves, and learn our relatives’ reprehensible political views. The calculation has shifted since, with Meta stealing something much more intimate, deeply personal, and hard-won than data. If I’d plagiarized someone’s book, I’d be in trouble. I’d go to court, face consequences, quite likely be publicly shamed. That’s not what’s happening to Zuckerberg. Instead, he hangs out at the White House. If you walked into Barnes & Noble and stole a $13 book, you’d get the police called on you. But steal 7.5 million, and you’ll make billions. It’s an object lesson in contemporary law enforcement: the bigger the crime, the more likely you are to get away with it. By the same token, shoplift some disposable razors and you’re a menace, a criminal. Steal 7.5 million books and you’re a visionary. That’s the math now. People love to obsess about thefts of toothpaste and Tide Pods at CVS (CVS) in San Francisco, but plunder on an epic scale just slightly further south and you’ll not only walk away untouched, you’ll emerge vastly richer. It’s hard to think this wasn’t Meta’s whole calculus to begin with. Gamble big, make billions, and let the lawsuits drag on. A lawyer friend of mine put it plainly: The copyright cases are about to enter discovery in both New York and California, and Meta is likely to lose. But by then, the damage will be done. As they said, “No one loves to read more than lawyers and judges.” In the meantime, the industry is already eyeing a workaround by lobbying the executive branch directly. Here’s the part I really hate to say: I don’t think they can be stopped either, whatever the class action lawsuit does. Facebook has faced down governments. It’s currently facing down the FTC and the European Union. And beyond Facebook, vast as it is, there’s the whole AI wave we’re all riding, if unequally. Companies like Meta, Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) are likely to reap long-term trillions by creating AI tools and programs. I’ve covered the stock market for more than a decade and I’ve never seen economic logic so relentless. Meanwhile, artists and white-collar workers are losing their livelihoods on top of the knowledge and ingenuity that’s already been stolen from them. To coin one’s brain into silver — and watch it be scraped by AI — is enough to make you question the point of doing it in the first place. Lest I seem knee-jerk anti-capitalist, I should add that I come at all this as an author and a shareholder. Checking my Etrade (MS) just now, I see I own about $31,000 in Meta stock. That’s in a regular, non-retirement brokerage account and doesn’t include shares I own indirectly through index and mutual funds. I started buying the stock circa the IPO because I’ve long recognized the wealth-creation dynamics of our era: Hard work may or may not pay off, but invest in companies like Meta and you can ride along for the extra-legal wealth they’re likely to create. It’s the surer thing. So I don’t begrudge Meta its $16.4 billion quarterly profit, not necessarily. But as a shareholder, I don’t want it earned through theft. And as a writer, I feel the same way. You want so badly to enter the cultural DNA. But if it means you get erased, robbed, exploited? Not so much. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: U.S. stocks drop on concerns over trade tensions

Wednesday, 07 May 2025 NEW YORK, May 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed lower on Tuesday as investors sifted through a wave of corporate earnings while looking ahead to developments on trade talks and the outcome of the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting, which began earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 389.83 points, or 0.95 percent, to 40,829.00. The S&P 500 dropped 43.47 points, or 0.77 percent, to 5,606.91, while the Nasdaq Composite Index slid 154.58 points, or 0.87 percent, to finish at 17,689.66. Nine of the eleven S&P 500 sectors ended in negative territory, led by healthcare and consumer discretionary, which declined 2.76 percent and 0.85 percent, respectively. Utilities and energy were the only sectors to post gains, up 1.23 percent and 0.10 percent. Stocks seesawed on Tuesday following a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, their first formal negotiation session since Carney recently took office. During the meeting, Trump dialed back earlier optimism about impending trade agreements, stating bluntly, "We don't have to sign deals." The remark marked a sharp reversal from his Sunday comments, when he suggested multiple deals could be finalized as soon as this week. Investors are now turning their attention to the Federal Reserve, which is not expected to change its benchmark interest rate this week. However, markets are eagerly awaiting Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks on Wednesday, particularly his views on how the Trump administration's tariff policies may be influencing the broader economic outlook. "Despite external pressure to lower rates, the Fed will likely hold strong on the current pause until we see greater clarity on the major economic factors impacting the economy," said Steve Rick, chief economist at TruStage. "As the impacts of tariffs settle in, we still broadly expect the economy to continue to shift towards a slower pace of growth than in recent months." Earnings reports drove notable stock movements on Tuesday. Palantir plunged 12.05 percent, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, despite meeting first-quarter earnings expectations and providing a positive forecast. In contrast, Constellation Energy surged 10.29 percent after beating revenue estimates, fueled by rising electricity demand linked to AI infrastructure growth. Ford Motor gained 2.65 percent after surpassing quarterly profit estimates, though it withdrew its full-year guidance due to tariff-related uncertainty. Mattel also climbed 2.78 percent as it suspended its outlook and announced price hikes in response to tariffs. Large-cap tech stocks, which had recently driven much of the market's rally, faced selling pressure. Tesla and Meta Platforms both declined by about 2 percent, while Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Broadcom, Apple and Nvidia also lost ground. Thank you for your report!

Title: The 7 Best Diaper Bags, According To Moms Who’ve Tested Over 20 Styles

Time Published: 2025-05-06T20:52:55Z

Before I had my first baby, I don’t think I truly understood how many things I would need to carry around with them whenever we left the house. The best diaper bags have the space to stow all those baby essentials like wipes, diapers, bottles, spare clothes, burp cloths and toys. They’re also comfortable and easy for parents to use, so you’re not digging through the diaper bag abyss to find that elusive pacifier. After testing over 20 diaper bags among several testers, we found the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack to be the best—it’s made of high-quality materials and has dedicated pockets for all the essentials. Our top value pick, the popular Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack, is lightweight, roomy and has remained durable through years of testing. The best diaper bags hold and organize everything you need for your little. Here are all of our winners after testing over 20 diaper bags: When choosing a diaper bag, consider the size and style you want. If you have multiple kids, you may need a larger bag—but be careful not to overload it. Additionally, many parents prefer a backpack or belt bag, so they can have their hands free. “A comfortable, well-designed and ergonomic diaper bag that meets your specific needs can improve quality of life as you navigate the daily demands of motherhood,” says Amy McCormick, an occupational therapist who leads the postpartum rehabilitation program at UNC Rex Holly Springs Hospital in North Carolina. Continue reading for an in-depth look at all of our top picks for the best diaper bags along with more information on our testing process and what to look for when you’re shopping for a diaper bag. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 13.4 x 6.7 x 13.8 inches | Weight: 1.3 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: A 100% guarantee on hardware and fabric defects for two years | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: With 10 total pockets, the Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack makes it simple to find a spot for all your baby items and then some. From a discreet felt-lined electronics pocket to stretchy diaper pockets and an insulated bottle pocket, there’s a place to put everything. The large main compartment zippers all the way down, which helps with packing the bag and finding things that may have fallen to the bottom. A strap on the back that attaches to rolling luggage makes it a great option for travel, too. It’s also the lightest diaper bag backpack that we tested. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Meta Backpack is just the right size for essentials. Many of the more stylish diaper bags I’ve tested are either uncomfortable or have fabrics that are difficult to maintain and clean. That isn’t the case with this bag. Depending on the style you choose, the outer material is either vegan leather, coated canvas or vegan leather with cable-stitch textured embossing. The styles are classic and professional, making this a good option to bring to work if you’re pumping or simply want to continue to use the bag after your baby is older. Though the bag isn’t machine washable, the materials are easy to wipe clean. Our tester intentionally spilled a blueberry pouch on the bag and left it to sit overnight. In the morning, it wiped up effortlessly. The included changing pad is machine washable, so there’s no need to worry about messy diaper changes. The comfort of this bag is a huge plus, too. It’s a backpack-style bag, which many of our experts recommend. The padded straps are nice and comfortable. “When worn properly, with both straps well positioned, [backpack bags] can help minimize risk of injury and reduce stress on the back, abdominals, and pelvic floor,” says McCormick., Though I laud the bag for its ample pockets, you can’t pack quite as much in this bag as some of our other top picks, like the Skip Hop Forma or the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag. When I try to put too many things in the bag, it becomes lumpy and awkward because there isn’t much give to the material. Our tester also found that the side water bottle pocket was difficult to pack when there were too many things in the main compartment. However, that limit on space is a good thing in some ways. “More space just means more stuff crammed inside—and trust us, you don’t need to carry everything but the kitchen sink,” says Laura Hunter, a licensed practical nurse and cofounder of Moms on Call, a parenting resource brand. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16 x 8 x 14 inches | Weight: 1.4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited warranty | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: The value of the Skip Hop Forma Diaper Bag Backpack is unmatched. My husband and I have used it as our main diaper bag for over five years, and it’s still in excellent shape. The bag has two padded straps and it’s a backpack bag, making it the ideal ergonomic option. Because it’s a backpack bag that’s incredibly lightweight, this is a good option for parents have back problems or moms who may struggle with core strength, pelvic floor strength or who are recovering from a c-section or tear. “Postpartum moms should consider their core and pelvic health when choosing a diaper bag. After a vaginal birth, weakened pelvic floor muscles and potential back pain mean a lightweight, evenly distributed bag (like a backpack style) is ideal to reduce strain. For c-section recovery, avoiding heavy shoulder bags that put pressure on healing abdominal muscles is crucial,” says John Gallucci Jr., a doctor of physical therapy and CEO of New York-based Jag Physical Therapy. The Skip Hop Forma is a great value option that's durable and easy to pack. I like packing this bag more than some of the more stylish or boxy bags because the material has some give to it. There are nine total pockets, plus two packing cubes. Pockets include two bottle pockets, a main compartment, two stretchy interior pockets, two front zipper pockets and more. The bag also comes with a changing pad. The side bottle pockets have plenty of room to hold water bottles for parents and caregivers or babies. The storage cubes are great for packing things on-the-go, too. If I want to leave the larger diaper bag in the car, I can put a bottle, diaper and some wipes in a packing cube and significantly lighten my load. McCormick likes the option of using removable storage cubes, too, as they make it easy to add and remove items based on the specific outing or activity. The fabric is water-repellent, and our tester found it easy to clean a spilled baby food pouch and water. In addition to being able to wipe down any spills, I’ve also found that it’s easy to clean out crumbs and messes at the bottom of the bag because the fabric has enough flexibility to it that I can turn the bag inside out. Dagne Dover Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 9.5 x 5.6 x 12.3 inches (small), 11.8 x 6.5 x 12.8 inches (medium, 12.3 x 7 x 13.8 (large) | Weight: 3 pounds (small), 3.5 pounds (medium), 4 pounds (large)| Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: Limited guarantee for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Hand wash Best for: Skip if: The Dagne Dover Indi Diaper Backpack comes in small, medium and large sizes, so parents can find the right option for their carrying style. In addition to the many interior and exterior pockets, including a wipes and insulated bottle holder, it also comes with extras like a storage pouch and a shoe bag. A luggage sleeve on the back makes this a good option for travel, too. Other extras include a changing mat and stroller clips, though we don’t recommend using stroller clips due to the potential danger of tipping the stroller. If you tend to overpack your bag, you might want to get the size larger than you think you’ll need. Our tester found that when she had the main compartment of the bag packed full, it was difficult to use the exterior zipper pockets. The fabric on the Dagne Dover Indi is so comfortable and soft. Many people love the look and feel of the Indi. The neoprene material is 100% vegan, and it’s available in a variety of aesthetic colors, some of which are gender-neutral. From the outside, it looks more like a regular backpack than a diaper bag. The fabric is soft, not stiff, and the nicely padded straps make it comfortable to wear. Our tester found that the fabric stretches easily to accommodate items that you throw in the bag. If you (or your kids) tend to spill things a lot, this may not be the best bag for you. When our tester spilled water and a tot food pouch on the bag, it initially cleaned up well, but in the long-term, she found some stains lingered on her camel-colored bag. Béis Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12 x 7.75 x 15 inches | Weight: 4 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 45-day return policy | Cleaning instructions: Wipe down Best for: Skip if: Some people like to overstuff their diaper bag (guilty as charged). Whether you’re packing for twins like me or just need extra space, the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag gives you the room you need. The top of the bag opens wide so you can pack and find the things you need, and there are a good number of pockets. Our tester found that the exterior bottle pockets were large enough to hold her water bottles, which wasn’t the case with every bag she tested. Inside, you can tighten the insulated bottle pouch so your baby’s bottle doesn’t get lost in the main compartment. Because it’s such a big bag and it already weighs 4 pounds, be careful not to overpack it. “Extremely large or heavy bags may encourage overpacking, making it hard to reach items and adding unnecessary strain to the back, abdominals and pelvic floor,” says McCormick. Though the bag can get heavy if you stuff too much in it, our tester found it comfortable with nicely padded straps. My favorite thing about the Béis Backpack Diaper Bag is that it’s obvious it was thoroughly designed with babies and parents in mind. The included changing pad has a pouch to store diapers, wipes or diaper rash cream. In the bag, you’ll find a pacifier pouch and a teething ring. There is also an odor-proof pouch, which is ideal for storing soiled clothes or for parents who use cloth diapers to store dirty diapers until they get home. Another included extra is stroller clips, though we do not recommend using these as the weight of the bag can tip your stroller. Our tester loved all of these extras as well as how easy the bag is to clean. The stain-resistant fabric can be wiped down. She had no problem cleaning up the food pouch that she intentionally spilled on the bag. The high-quality and easy-to-clean material makes this a great pick for families with multiple kids or those who want a durable bag that can stand up to extensive everyday use. Caraa Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 12.3 x 12 x 5 inches (medium), 13 x 12.8 x 5.8 (large) | Weight: 2.5 pounds (medium), 3 pounds (large) | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 21 day return period, manufacturing defects are assessed on a case by case basis | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable (black), clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth (all other colors) Best for: Skip if: Becoming a parent doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your style or your love for luxury products. The Caraa Baby Bag is made with parent and baby in mind, with so many thoughtful features. Forbes Vetted editor Margaret Badore found that this bag had the best features of all the high-end bags she tested. She particularly likes the hot/cold pocket and the fully removable diaper caddy. The caddy has four pockets for storing wipes, diapers and other essentials, and it’s a helpful feature for packing a few things on the go. “The removable organizer is also extremely useful; when packed with diaper change essentials, I could take just that part out and head to the bathroom with baby for a change,” says Badore. Unfortunately, the bag does not come with a changing pad to complement the diaper caddy. One of my favorite baby-friendly features: the black version of the bag is machine washable, which isn’t a common feature in diaper bags. No matter the spill, you can throw it in the wash for quick cleanup. For other color options, you need to clean with mild neutral soap mixed with warm water and a clean microfiber cloth to maintain the color. The Caraa Baby Bag can be worn as a backpack or a cross-body bag. The bag is available in a medium or large size, and the versatility is key. You can choose to wear the bag as a backpack or as a crossbody bag by attaching a shoulder strap. When you wear it this way, you can tuck the backpack straps out of the way. The bag also comes with stroller hooks, but we don’t recommend using them because hanging a bag on your stroller can cause it to tip. This bag has so many pockets. From insulated bottle pockets to a phone pocket to hot/cold pockets and pockets with magnetic closures, you’ll certainly find a spot to put everything. When you’re traveling, simply slide the bag onto your luggage with the attached luggage sleeve. Badore has used this bag for about two years, including on family trips and as a carry-on, and has found virtually no signs of wear. The profile of this bag is a bit wider than many others, so that’s something to consider if you need your bag to fit into a compact area. State Bags Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 16.5 x 13 x 5.9 inches | Weight: 1.9 pounds | Bag style: Backpack | Warranty: 1 year for material or manufacturing defects | Cleaning instructions: Spot clean with a damp cloth Best for: Skip if: A gender neutral diaper bag is ideal if you’ll be sharing the bag with other caregivers—or perhaps you simply prefer that look and style. From the outside, the State Lorimer Diaper Bag doesn’t scream diaper bag, and it’s available in five colors, including the several gender-neutral picks like an olive, black and navy. You can personalize the bag with up to three characters and two symbols or patches. The padded straps are nice, and Badore found the bag comfortable even when it was loaded up. When traveling, you can also attach the bag to your luggage with a built-in luggage slip. The fabric is easy to clean. In our tests, water ran right off the nylon parts, and our spilled pouch wiped up no problem. Badore appreciates all of the pockets in this bag, which include two main compartments, a front zipper pocket, side water bottle pockets, an insulated bottle pocket and more. With so many places to put things, it’s less likely you’ll lose something at the bottom of the bag. It also includes a washable changing pad and a padded laptop sleeve that fits laptops up to 15 inches. For parents who sometimes have to work while taking care of their kids, this can be a huge plus. Though there is plenty of room for all of the essentials, the large size of this bag could encourage you to pack too much, which could put extra stain on your back. This can also be dangerous if you use the attached stroller clips as a heavy diaper bag could tip a stroller. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Dimensions: 6.5 x 7 x 4 inches | Weight: 2 pounds | Bag style: Belt bag | Warranty: Limited warranty for 1 year | Cleaning instructions: Machine washable Best for: Skip if: I really couldn’t ask for much more in a compact diaper bag. The Colugo On-The-Go Organizer is sleek, comfortable and highly adjustable. According to Hunter, small and compact is the way to go. “Moms on Call recommends smaller, well-organized bags that keep only the essentials at your fingertips. Some other features we can do without,” she says. The bag has enough room for the basics like diapers and wipes. It has six pockets plus two bottle holders, so you can keep your items organized, too. Our tester was surprised at how many things she could fit in the bag. It also had room for her son’s sweatshirt. The Colugo On The Go Organizer is ideal for staying hands-free while carrying all the essentials. My favorite thing about this bag is that it can double as a stroller organizer. While hanging larger, heavier bags from a stroller is unsafe due to the potential for tipping, I don’t worry about that with such a small bag. In fact, the bag is designed to be a stroller organizer first, diaper bag second. It’s nice to be able to just grab the bag and go when you need to park your stroller or leave it somewhere unattended. The versatility makes the price just right, too. You’re getting two products in one. I appreciate machine-washable diaper bags like this one, because with three kids, sometimes I don’t realize a spill happened until well after the fact. It wipes down easily, too. Our tester spilled the majority of a water bottle in the bag and found that it dried easily and didn’t get things stored in other pockets wet. The bag is simple to adjust and comfortable. I don’t have to fiddle with the straps too much to get them where I want them. Other crossbody or belt bags that I’ve tested feel too boxy or bulky, but I didn’t find that with this one. The strap also has a pretty wide range, meaning it can work for caregivers of various sizes. Over several years, we’ve tested more than 20 diaper bags among three mom testers. We included our favorites in the guide and continue to test additional bags as they become available. Here are the others we’ve tested: Freshly Picked Classic Diaper Bag: I’ve had this bag for years, and I really like the style and look of it. However, it’s pretty boxy, and it doesn’t offer as many organization options as other bags. Another tester also found that it started to fray almost immediately, which made us question the high price tag. BabbleRoo Diaper Bag Backpack: This is a budget-friendly diaper bag that is available in many colors and styles. It also has a lot of useful pockets, like a pacifier pouch and three insulated bottle pockets. It wasn’t as comfortable as some of the other bags we tested, and our tester found it difficult to pack the bag with everything she needed. Ruvalino Diaper Bag Backpack: This popular bag is well-loved for its low price. However, it’s somewhat bulky and stiff. It was also a bit more difficult to clean than many other bags we tested. We enjoyed the variety of pockets and were able to pack a lot into the bag. Herschel Baby Strand Sprout Shoulder Bag: Though this is more of a minimalistic bag, there is plenty of space inside. Our tester really liked the included changing pad. Unfortunately, it lacks many of the features of our top picks and our tester wasn’t able to find a comfortable way to carry the bag. Eddie Bauer Cascade Back Pack Diaper Bag: There are plenty of features packed into this diaper bag like a wipes pocket, insulated bottle pocket and changing pad. However, it’s not as user-friendly as we’d like. It can be difficult to reach the bottom of the main compartment and our tester found that the diaper pockets weren’t wide enough. Béis The Diaper Pack: This bag has some nice features like a changing pad and a convenient wipes pocket. It’s also pretty spacious for a belt bag. However, I found it too boxy and bulky. The main dealbreaker was that when worn as a belt bag, I couldn’t get the straps small enough. Parents and caregivers with slim frames may struggle to get the bag tight enough to stay on. Dagne Dover Ace: Those searching for something extra minimalistic might like this fanny pack diaper bag—but it just didn’t have enough features or space for us. Storq Quick Change Fanny Pack : Though this bag is a good size for a belt bag, it doesn’t have the organization features necessary to store the amount of baby gear you can fit in a bag. We like that it’s lightweight and machine washable. Ditty Co. Small Diaper Bag: This belt bag is comfortable and machine washable with an affordable price that matches it size. It might work for some families who prefer to pack light, but we wanted more space. Luli Baby Monaco Sling Bag: This sling bag has nice features given its smaller package, such as a pacifier holder and a phone pocket. It’s more complicated to adjust and get items out of than other bags we tested, though, and when you’re juggling babies and all their things, you don’t want a bag that makes things more difficult. State Jordan Diaper Bag: We were able to fit plenty of things in this bag and liked the organizing pouches and changing pad. However, we didn’t find the shoulder strap very comfortable, especially when compared to backpack style diaper bags. BagSmart Walker 25L Featherlight Travel Diaper Backpack: There are a lot of features in this bag that we appreciated, like the large insulated bottle pocket and the waterproof laundry pouch. What our tester didn’t like was that many of these features don’t quite work the way they should. For example, the insulated bottle pouch didn’t fit many popular bottle brands, and it was hard to get diapers to fit into the diaper pouches. JuJuBe B.F.F. Diaper Bag: You can wear this bag as a backpack, messenger bag or shoulder bag—but our tester didn’t find it comfortable to wear, and it wasn’t quite big enough to fit all of our supplies. We also tested the Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag and the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag. The Petunia Pickle Bottom Mini Bag is no longer in stock, and though the Kibou Fanny Pack Diaper Bag was our previous pick for the best diaper belt bag, the bag has since been discontinued. What we’re testing next: We’re continuing to test two No Reception bags, two Calpak diaper bags, including the Calpak Diaper Backpack With Laptop Sleeve, and plan to consider the new Away diaper bag collection as well as Uppababy’s Changing Backpack, among others. We’ve spent years testing diaper bags and between myself and two other testers, we’ve tested over 20 bags. For this round of testing in 2025, myself and baby and kids gear editor Margaret Badore tested a combined 11 bags, and some bags have been tested by multiple families. We tested the diaper bags in real-world situations, like daycare drop-offs, family outings and trips to the pediatrician’s office. Here’s a peek at what we looked for when we tested bags: The best diaper bags make it easier for you to get out and about with your kids. Here are some factors to consider when shopping for a diaper bag. The three most common types of diaper bags are backpack, fanny pack or belt bags and shoulder or tote bags. Many parents and caregivers want a diaper bag that fits their style as it can become an extension of themselves for quite a few years. Don’t forget to consider the preferences of your partner or other caregivers, too. While you might love a stylish floral print bag, another caregiver you’ll be sharing the bag with might not. Ergonomics are incredibly important, particularly for new moms. After delivery, moms might face weakened abdominal muscles and a weakened pelvic floor. They might also be recovering from a c-section or a perineal tear. For any parent or caregiver, an ergonomic diaper bag can help reduce the risk of developing back, neck and shoulder pain. Some ergonomic features to look for include wide, padded backpack straps that allow you to evenly distribute weight, structured bags that maintain their shape while wearing them and adjustable straps. Choosing a lightweight bag and limiting how much you pack can be beneficial, too. “It’s important that all moms choose a diaper bag that is lightweight and adjustable to safely distribute weight and support healing of the pelvic floor and abdominals that are often compromised from the strain endured during both pregnancy and childbirth,” says McCormick. “Moms experiencing postural changes or diastasis recti should prioritize ergonomic designs that prevent excessive forward hunching,” adds Gallucci. “Ultimately, a well-balanced, adjustable bag can help reduce discomfort and support postpartum recovery.” Diaper bags can have many features. Some helpful ones include insulated pockets, changing pads, diaper pockets, wipe pockets, device pockets, storage cubes or pouches and clips for keys and toys. “Durable and easy-to-clean materials can hold up to everyday use, make messes quick to resolve with less stress, and prevent caregiver fatigue by allowing the bag to be set down without concern for damage,” says McCormick. While some bags are machine washable, most are water-resistant and can be wiped clean. I’m a parenting writer, product tester and mom to three, and I cover baby and kids gear for Forbes Vetted. I’ve been testing baby, kids and parenting products for seven years, and I’ve tested many diaper bags on this list, some of which I’ve used for years. I test a wide range of products, from the best toys for 6-month-olds to the best strollers. In addition to testing products for this article, I also spoke to other parents and testers about which diaper bags they liked, conducted in-depth research, compared features of the diaper bags and interviewed four experts. Those experts include: At its core, a diaper bag is simply a place to carry baby essentials while you’re out and about. You can use a purse, backpack or any other type of bag as a diaper bag. However, many diaper bags have convenient features such as insulated bottle pockets, wipes pouches and elastic diaper storage pockets. They’re designed to carry all your baby essentials and often come with built-in changing pads, too. Prices of diaper bags can range from around $20 to over $200. Many durable and comfortable diaper bags fall in the $75 to $100 range. You might pay a bit more for something that’s more stylish or made of higher-end materials. When it comes to a diaper bag, the lighter, the better. As you add more things into the bag, it can get heavy, causing back and neck strain. Most diaper bags are 4 pounds or less with some belt bags weighing under a pound.

ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS(Millions except per share amounts and percentages) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(Millions) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(Millions) (Unaudited) ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES, INC.SELECTED CORPORATE DATA(Millions) (Unaudited) (1) The Company operates as three operating segments, Data Center, Client and Gaming, and Embedded segments.The Data Center segment primarily includes Artificial Intelligence (AI) accelerators, server microprocessors (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), accelerated processing units (APUs), data processing units (DPUs), Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) and Adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products for data centers.The Client and Gaming segment primarily includes CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, and discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services.The Embedded segment primarily includes embedded CPUs, GPUs, APUs, FPGAs, System on Modules (SOMs), and Adaptive SoC products. From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio. All Other category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the operating segments, such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, inventory loss at contract manufacturer and restructuring charges. (2) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA The Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA” as a supplemental measure of its performance. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company is determined by adjusting GAAP net income for interest expense, other (income) expense, net, income tax provision (benefit), equity income in investee, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, inventory loss at contract manufacturer, acquisition-related and other costs, and restructuring charges. The Company calculates and presents Adjusted EBITDA because management believes it is of importance to investors and lenders in relation to its overall capital structure and its ability to borrow additional funds. In addition, the Company presents Adjusted EBITDA because it believes this measure assists investors in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the Company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance. The Company’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view Adjusted EBITDA as an alternative to the GAAP operating measure of net income or GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities that can affect cash flows. (3) Reconciliation of GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow The Company also presents free cash flow as a supplemental Non-GAAP measure of its performance. Free cash flow is determined by adjusting GAAP net cash provided by operating activities for capital expenditures, and free cash flow margin % is free cash flow expressed as a percentage of the Company's net revenue. The Company calculates and communicates free cash flow in the financial earnings press release because management believes it is of importance to investors to understand the nature of these cash flows. The Company’s calculation of free cash flow may or may not be consistent with the calculation of this measure by other companies in the same industry. Investors should not view free cash flow as an alternative to GAAP liquidity measures of cash flows from operating activities.

The Modern Weight Struggle: Why People Are Still Gaining Weight Uncovering the Hidden Barriers to Sustainable Weight Loss In a world flooded with quick-fix diets, viral fitness challenges, and high-performance meal plans, many people still ask the same question:“Why am I not losing weight?”Despite exercising regularly or cutting calories, countless individuals find themselves stuck—unable to make meaningful or lasting progress. This plateau is more than just frustrating; it’s a major reason why so many people give up on their weight loss journeys altogether. The truth is, weight gain is rarely just about calories in versus calories out. Underlying health patterns and modern lifestyle factors are working against many of us, including: These issues create the perfect environment for weight gain, bloating, low energy, and slowed metabolism—even if you're doing "all the right things."

LipoJaro Ingredients Breakdown Exploring the Natural Compounds That Power LipoJaro LipoJaro’s formula is built on a blend of natural ingredients selected to support the body’s fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and digestive balance—without the use of stimulants. This focus aligns with 2025’s clean-label movement and the shift toward non-GMO, plant-based supplements for weight management. Below is a closer look at each of the key ingredients in LipoJaro and how they may contribute to a more sustainable wellness routine. While individual results will vary, the inclusion of these compounds is grounded in a combination of traditional use and emerging scientific research. Disclaimer: The following ingredient descriptions are for informational purposes only and are not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any disease. Consult your healthcare provider before beginning any supplement. Glucomannan Glucomannan is a water-soluble dietary fiber derived from the root of the konjac plant. Once ingested, it expands in the stomach by absorbing water, which may create a sensation of fullness and reduce overall calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) CLA is a type of fatty acid found in meat and dairy products, though LipoJaro uses a plant-derived version. CLA has been studied for its potential to promote fat oxidation and preserve lean body mass. Green Tea Extract Green tea extract contains catechins—especially EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate)—that are associated with fat-burning and antioxidant support. Garcinia Cambogia Derived from a tropical fruit, garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been explored for its potential role in suppressing appetite and reducing fat storage. Chromium Chromium is a trace mineral that may play a role in glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Black Pepper Extract (BioPerine®) Black pepper extract is often added to enhance nutrient absorption. It improves bioavailability, making other ingredients in the formula more effective. Additional Botanicals and Synergistic Compounds While the primary ingredients carry most of the functional benefits, LipoJaro may also include supportive compounds such as: These additions are designed to round out the supplement and enhance its total impact over time. Designed for Ingredient Transparency LipoJaro’s formulation avoids artificial additives, preservatives, and synthetic fillers. Each capsule reflects the brand’s focus on quality, third-party testing, and manufacturing in GMP-certified facilities. Disclaimer: Effects are not guaranteed and may vary depending on the individual. Always verify ingredient labels for allergies or contraindications. No more jitters. Just results. Shop LipoJaro today and start your journey to better appetite control and metabolism—risk-free for 60 days! Reported Side Effects and Safety Considerations What to Know Before Starting LipoJaro While LipoJaro is marketed as a non-stimulant, natural weight management supplement, understanding its potential side effects and overall safety profile is important for informed use. Based on the formulation and user-reported feedback, most individuals tolerate the product well when taken as directed. That said, it's essential to explore how the body might initially respond to the active compounds, especially for first-time users or those with underlying health conditions. LipoJaro is formulated without common stimulants like caffeine or synephrine, which are often responsible for jitteriness, rapid heart rate, or sleep disturbances in traditional fat burners. Instead, it relies on a combination of fiber-rich and fat metabolism-supportive ingredients such as glucomannan, green tea extract, and CLA. These are generally considered gentle on the system, but they may cause mild digestive changes for some users during the adjustment period. Possible Mild Reactions Reported by Users Some individuals may experience: These effects are typically transient and tend to subside after the first few days of consistent use. Drinking adequate water when taking LipoJaro is essential for optimal fiber expansion and to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort. Disclaimer: These potential side effects are not experienced by everyone. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional before beginning any new supplement, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition, or are taking prescription medications. Who Should Avoid Taking LipoJaro? Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, there are cases where it may not be advisable. It may not be appropriate for individuals who: Because the supplement works partly by expanding in the stomach to help control appetite, it’simportant to take it with at least 8 oz of water. Taking it dry or without adequate hydration could result in discomfort or choking risk. A Clean-Label Alternative for Sensitive Users Compared to many over-the-counter weight loss products, LipoJaro offers a gentler approach—free of synthetic stimulants, harsh laxatives, or artificial colors and preservatives. This makes it appealing to those who have experienced side effects from stimulant-heavy formulas in the past or who prefer a cleaner supplement experience. As with any supplement, the best approach is to start slowly, listen to your body, and maintain open communication with a healthcare provider. LipoJaro's formula is designed for daily use, but it’s always smart to monitor how it fits into your personal health routine. Ready to ditch the crash diets?

Real User Results: What People Are Saying A Closer Look at the Lived Experience Behind the Label When evaluating a supplement like LipoJaro, it's not enough to simply review the ingredient list—real-world feedback from actual users offers some of the most valuable insight into what the product can or cannot do. Many people considering a non-stimulant fat burner want to know: Does LipoJaro actually work? What kinds of results can I expect? Are users satisfied with their outcomes? Across public reviews, feedback platforms, and testimonials shared on the official website, user impressions of LipoJaro show a mix of positive momentum and realistic expectations. While individual results vary, many users report benefits such as improved portion control, reduced cravings, more balanced energy levels, and modest but noticeable body composition changes when paired with healthy habits. Reported Positive Outcomes Common positive experiences include: For some individuals, the impact was not dramatic in the first few days, but became more noticeable with consistent use over two to three weeks. This gradual shift aligns with the supplement's intended purpose—supporting long-term metabolic and appetite regulation rather than forcing aggressive short-term weight loss. “After struggling with portion control for years, I finally feel like I’m in charge of my hunger instead of the other way around. LipoJaro made a big difference for me.” — Verified User Review “I wanted something without caffeine or jittery side effects. LipoJaro didn’t give me a quick fix, but it helped me stay consistent and avoid the late-night snacking that always ruined my progress.” — Verified Buyer Experience Realistic Expectations and Moderate Feedback While many users express satisfaction, some note that LipoJaro did not deliver drastic results on its own, especially without any dietary or exercise adjustments. A few reviewers mention needing to increase their water intake or adjust meal timing to better coordinate with the supplement. Others express the desire for quicker visual results, though they acknowledge the formula's stimulant-free nature and emphasis on sustainability over speed. Key Takeaways from User Feedback Disclaimer: Testimonials reflect individual experiences and are not guarantees of specific results. Supplement effects vary based on individual physiology, activity levels, and adherence to a healthy lifestyle. By analyzing user responses, it becomes clear that LipoJaro is built more for reliability and balance than extreme fat loss. Those looking for a clean-label, stimulant-free addition to their routine may find it a helpful tool on the journey to better metabolic health. Your metabolism deserves better. LipoJaro supports sustainable fat loss—no harsh stimulants. Order today and save up to $780 instantly! Common Complaints and How They’re Handled Addressing the Concerns Behind the Feedback While many LipoJaro users report positive experiences, it’s important to acknowledge and evaluate the most common concerns shared by customers. A transparent supplement review doesn’t just highlight benefits—it also takes into account areas where users may have encountered friction or unmet expectations. Like any widely distributed wellness product, LipoJaro receives a range of feedback. Most complaints are not about the formulation itself but revolve around order fulfillment, expectations for rapid results, or communication with customer service. Understanding these concerns—and how the company addresses them—can help potential buyers make a more informed decision. Most Frequently Reported Complaints Disclaimer: Experiences vary by customer. For all support issues, it’s best to retain order confirmation emails and communicate directly with the official support team to ensure accurate service. How LipoJaro’s Brand Responds LipoJaro’s website features a clear returns policy and states a 60-day satisfaction guarantee. To back this, they provide a dedicated customer service email to handle refund requests, product inquiries, and shipping updates. While this policy is in place, like any supplement company, response times can fluctuate based on volume. The company also encourages buyers to use the product consistently for at least 30 days before judging its effectiveness—especially because it is not formulated with fast-acting synthetic stimulants that might mask true metabolic shifts. Transparent Business Practices Matter Although no product is universally loved, a brand’s willingness to address concerns head-on and stand by its refund policy reflects positively on its business model. Customers are encouraged to review all terms of service, usage instructions, and return guidelines before purchasing. Disclaimer: Always refer to the official website for the latest return policy, terms of use, and customer service contact information. Business policies are subject to change. Who Should Consider LipoJaro? Identifying the Ideal User Profile LipoJaro is designed for individuals seeking support in managing weight-related challenges using a non-stimulant, plant-based approach. While it is not a substitute for a healthy lifestyle, it may offer meaningful support for people who struggle with appetite control, cravings, and slow metabolism—especially those looking to avoid harsh ingredients or quick-fix gimmicks. Based on the ingredients and reported effects, LipoJaro may be a good fit for the following groups: Why the Stimulant-Free Approach Appeals to a Broader Audience Many people avoid traditional fat burners due to side effects such as anxiety, heart palpitations, or disrupted sleep. LipoJaro’snon-stimulant formula allows for daily use without triggering the nervous system or interfering with natural energy cycles. This makes it an attractive option for those seeking gentle, sustainable weight management rather than short-term energy spikes. Additionally, the inclusion of fiber-based ingredients like glucomannan and digestion-enhancing compounds such as black pepper extract can appeal to people dealing with bloating, irregularity, or sluggish digestion—factors that can all contribute to weight retention. Disclaimer: LipoJaro is not intended for individuals under 18, those with swallowing difficulties, or anyone diagnosed with a medical condition without physician approval. Always speak with a qualified healthcare provider before beginning any new dietary supplement. Who Might Not Benefit While LipoJaro is formulated to be accessible and well-tolerated, it may not suit everyone. Individuals expecting rapid fat loss, or those who are not committed to making lifestyle adjustments alongside supplement use, may not achieve optimal outcomes. Similarly, anyone requiring a medically supervised weight loss program should not use over-the-counter supplements without direct approval from a medical professional. Supporting the Right Expectations LipoJaro works best as a complement to balanced nutrition, hydration, and movement. It is not a magic bullet, but rather a support tool for those who are ready to improve consistency and reduce self-sabotaging habits like emotional eating or erratic hunger patterns. When used as directed, it may help users feel more in control of their eating, experience gradual improvements in body composition, and support their long-term weight wellness goals. Natural weight loss starts here—LipoJaro is trusted by thousands. Shop today for powerful appetite support with no side effects! How to Use LipoJaro for Maximum Benefit Following the Suggested Routine for Effective Results To get the most from any dietary supplement—especially one designed for non-stimulant metabolic support—consistency and proper timing matter. LipoJaro is formulated with ingredients like glucomannan, CLA, and green tea extract that work best when taken regularly and in conjunction with balanced lifestyle habits. According to the manufacturer, the recommended usage is to take two capsules per day, ideally 30 minutes before your two largest meals of the day, such as breakfast and lunch. This allows the ingredients to interact with food intake and support satiety before eating begins. Taking the capsules with at least 8 ounces of water is essential, particularly because glucomannan expands in the stomach to promote a sense of fullness. This hydration step is critical—not just for effectiveness, but for safety. Disclaimer: Never take LipoJaro dry or without sufficient water, as this could pose a choking hazard. Individuals with difficulty swallowing should not use this product. Tips for Integrating LipoJaro Into Your Daily Routine To optimize your experience with LipoJaro, consider the following best practices: What to Avoid While Taking LipoJaro Although LipoJaro is generally well-tolerated, it may be best to avoid pairing it with other fiber-heavy products or additional appetite suppressants without guidance from a healthcare provider. Overdoing fiber can lead to bloating or discomfort, especially if not spaced out properly. Additionally, combining LipoJaro with stimulant-based fat burners could be redundant and may offset its balanced, gentle effects. Disclaimer: Always read ingredient labels when combining supplements. If you are currently using other weight management products, consult a healthcare professional before adding LipoJaro to your routine. A Support Tool, Not a Standalone Solution LipoJaro works best when it's part of a bigger strategy that includes healthy meals, mindful eating, and light to moderate activity. While the supplement may help reduce calorie intake by encouraging smaller portion sizes and minimizing cravings, it is not intended to replace food, medication, or professional health guidance. When used with intention and discipline, LipoJaro may provide valuable support in staying on track, particularly for individuals prone to overeating or struggling with energy dips that derail consistent habits. Join the clean-label movement with LipoJaro! Plant-based, non-GMO, stimulant-free support—order now and take control of your cravings! Science & Clinical Support The Research Behind LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro as a branded supplement has not been subjected to its own clinical trials, several of its key ingredients are supported by independent studies and scientific literature that examine their potential roles in appetite control, fat metabolism, and digestive health. The formulation reflects a common evidence-informed strategy used in modern weight management supplements: targeting multiple metabolic pathways without relying on synthetic stimulants. Below is a breakdown of some of the research associated with LipoJaro’s core ingredients, including how they may function in the body to support weight wellness. Disclaimer: The following summary includes third-party research on individual ingredients. These studies do not imply guaranteed results from LipoJaro. Always consult with your healthcare provider before relying on supplements for clinical support. Glucomannan and Appetite Regulation Glucomannan is one of the most studied soluble fibers in the context of weight management. According to a 2005 study published in the International Journal of Obesity, participants who took glucomannan before meals showed greater reductions in body weight compared to a placebo group, primarily due to improved satiety and reduced calorie intake. Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) and Fat Oxidation CLA has been examined for its possible impact on body composition. A meta-analysis published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reviewed 18 studies and found that CLA supplementation produced modest fat loss over time in overweight individuals. Green Tea Extract and Thermogenic Support Green tea extract—particularly its catechins like EGCG—has shown potential in increasing energy expenditure and supporting fat oxidation. A study in the Journal of Nutrition found that green tea extract enhanced fat burning during exercise. Garcinia Cambogia and Craving Control Garcinia cambogia contains hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which has been examined for its effects on appetite and serotonin levels. Some studies suggest it may reduce calorie intake by promoting a sensation of fullness. Chromium and Blood Sugar Support Chromium has been studied for its role in improving insulin sensitivity and glucose regulation. Maintaining stable blood sugar can influence hunger patterns and help reduce cravings for sweets or processed carbohydrates. BioPerine® (Black Pepper Extract) for Absorption BioPerine is frequently added to enhance the bioavailability of other nutrients, ensuring the body absorbs and utilizes ingredients more efficiently. This compound does not directly affect fat loss but may improve the overall efficacy of the supplement. LipoJaro’s ingredient profile reflects an alignment with clinical research, focusing on appetite control, energy utilization, and digestive health—all without harsh stimulants. Though more research is always needed on supplement synergy and long-term use, the product is formulated in a way that mirrors many successful strategies in modern wellness science.

Expert Opinions: What Health Professionals Say How Today’s Wellness Experts View LipoJaro’s Ingredient Strategy While LipoJaro has not been formally endorsed by a specific medical organization or clinical board, many of its individual ingredients reflect trends and strategies endorsed by integrative nutritionists and holistic health professionals. These experts often encourage a whole-body, stimulant-free approach to metabolic wellness—an approach that mirrors LipoJaro’s formulation. Given the increasing awareness of gut health, fiber intake, and blood sugar regulation in weight management, many professionals now emphasize the importance of dietary support that does not rely on chemical stimulants or extreme restriction. Supplements like LipoJaro that combine soluble fiber, thermogenic botanicals, and absorption-enhancing compounds offer a balanced alternative for individuals seeking gentle assistance in their health journey. Disclaimer: The opinions shared below reflect general statements from professionals on key ingredients used in LipoJaro. These are not direct endorsements of the product and should not replace individualized medical advice. Nutritionist Insight on Glucomannan Functional nutritionists often highlight glucomannan as a leading ingredient in natural appetite support. By expanding in the stomach and slowing digestion, it may help reduce overeating, especially when consumed with adequate water before meals. According to registered dietitians, soluble fiber like glucomannan plays a dual role: it supports satiety and improves digestive health. These benefits are particularly important for those who struggle with energy dips caused by blood sugar spikes after large meals. Professional Support for CLA and Green Tea Extract In the field of sports nutrition and weight management coaching, CLA and green tea extract are often used for individuals who need metabolic support without the overstimulation of caffeine-based products. These ingredients are praised for their ability to complement regular activity and healthy eating, not replace it. Practitioners point out that green tea catechins, in particular, may assist with mild thermogenesis and antioxidant defense, both of which are relevant for long-term wellness and recovery. Emphasis on Safe and Gentle Supplementation One key message echoed by many professionals is the importance of realistic expectations and personalization. Most experts agree that fat burners are not magic solutions—but when used with structure and discipline, a well-designed formula like LipoJaro may be a reasonable option for individuals needing support with consistency, especially in the areas of appetite control and daily routine management. They also value formulations that avoid harsh chemicals or artificial additives, which aligns with LipoJaro’s clean-label promise and manufacturing standards. As public understanding of metabolism, digestion, and long-term weight regulation continues to grow, more health professionals are embracing tools that gently support the body's natural systems rather than override them with temporary, high-intensity effects. LipoJaro fits this emerging philosophy by focusing on balance, sustainability, and ingredient integrity. LipoJaro vs Other Weight Loss Supplements How LipoJaro Stands Out in a Crowded Market With countless weight loss supplements competing for attention, it can be difficult for consumers to distinguish between products that offer real support and those built around marketing hype. LipoJaro differentiates itself by embracing a non-stimulant, clean-label approach that caters to individuals looking for sustainable weight management support without sacrificing long-term health. Unlike many traditional fat burners that rely heavily on caffeine or synthetic ingredients to trigger short-term effects like rapid energy bursts or dehydration-induced water loss, LipoJaro offers a plant-based formula that works gradually with the body to help regulate appetite, optimize digestion, and support fat metabolism. Comparison Factors to Consider 1. Formulation Strategy 2. Intended Use and User Sensitivity 3. Transparency and Clean Labeling 4. Customer-Centric Policies Disclaimer: All supplement comparisons are made based on available product information as of the time of writing. Individual product effectiveness and user satisfaction may vary. Always refer to official sources before making purchase decisions. Ideal for a Wellness-Focused Audience LipoJaro is better suited to consumers who value long-term health and are not seeking dramatic overnight transformations. It aligns with 2025 trends in personalized nutrition, gut health optimization, and non-stimulant metabolic support. Those who are already practicing mindful eating and incorporating regular movement may find it particularly helpful in curbing excess hunger and reinforcing dietary structure. By contrast, more aggressive fat burners may appeal to competitive athletes or short-term transformation seekers—but often at the expense of tolerability or holistic health.

Title: Adobe Premiere Pro vs. Apple Final Cut Pro: Which Video Editing App Should You Use?
URL: https://me.pcmag.com/en/video-editing/29704/adobe-premiere-pro-vs-apple-final-cut-pro-which-video-editing-app-should-you-use
Time Published: 2025-05-06T18:36:26Z
Full Content:
Apple's Final Cut Pro gives you a wealth of powerful video editing tools in a relatively simple interface, making it well worth the one-time price for professionals and serious hobbyists alike. VS Adobe Premiere Pro is an expansive, professional-level video editing program with top-notch editing tools, swift rendering speeds, useful collaboration features, and a well-designed interface. Adobe Premiere Pro requires a Creative Cloud subscription. You have three main options: an annual plan you pay up front ($263.88), an annual plan you pay monthly ($22.99 per month), or a month-to-month plan ($34.49 per month). Adobe also offers more affordable plans for students and pricier ones for businesses. If you want the entire Creative Cloud suite, which includes Audition, Photoshop, Illustrator, and a raft of other Adobe creative software, you need to pay $59.99 per month. The subscription model not only gets you program updates, which Adobe delivers semiannually, but also 100GB of cloud storage for syncing media. Any of these plans entitles you to activate the software on just two computers. A perpetual license for Final Cut Pro costs $299.99. It works out to be cheaper than Premiere Pro after just a year and a half, and you still get feature updates. Final Cut Pro is available from the Mac App Store, which eases the process of downloading updates and lets you install the program on multiple computers as long as you sign into the same Apple account. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro runs on both Windows and macOS. The online user guide states that it is the company's policy "to support the current and the most recent previous version of each operating system." For the moment, that means Windows 10 (64-bit) version 22H2 (or later) or Windows 11 with: On macOS, you need version 12 or later with: Premiere Pro runs on Apple silicon–based Macs natively. As you might expect, Final Cut Pro runs only on Macs. It requires macOS 14.6 or later, 8GB of RAM (it recommends 16GB), and a Metal-capable graphics card for Intel-based computers. For VR headset support, you also need SteamVR. Final Cut Pro runs smoothly on Apple silicon–based Macs as a native application. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro stays true to the tradition of high-end, professional-level software. Ease of use and simplicity of interface are not paramount among its goals. That said, there's no reason that a determined amateur with time to devote to learning the software couldn’t use it. Adobe has other products more appropriate for hobbyists, including Premiere Elements. Apple makes the upgrade path from its consumer-level video editor, iMovie, very smooth. The latest version of Final Cut on the desktop also makes it easy to import projects you started on an iPhone or iPad. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro uses a traditional nonlinear editor (NLE) timeline with tracks and track heads. It calls your timeline content a sequence, and you can create nested sequences, subsequences, and subclips to keep everything organized. The timeline has tabs for multiple sequences, which can be helpful if you're working with nested sequences. Longtime video editors are likely more comfortable with this setup than with Apple's more inventive trackless Magnetic Timeline. Adobe's system also fits with some pro workflows in which the tracks are in an expected arrangement. It works differently from consumer video editing apps, however, because it automatically separates a clip's audio track from its video. The timeline is very scalable and offers the usual razor, ripple, roll, slip, and slide tools. The interface is extremely configurable, letting you undock any and all panels. You can show or hide FX badges, keyframes, thumbnails, and waveforms. You get seven preconfigured workspaces (including Assembly, Editing, Color, and Titles) compared with Final Cut's mere three. Apple's innovative trackless Magnetic Timeline is easier on the eyes than the traditional timeline interface, and it offers several editing advantages, such as connected Auditions, clips, and roles (descriptive labels such as Dialog, Effects, Music, Titles, and Video). Auditions let you designate optional clips or takes for a spot in your movie, and you can group clips into compound clips—roughly the equivalent of Premiere's Nested Sequences. Instead of tracks, Final Cut Pro uses lanes, with a primary storyline that everything else attaches to. This makes keeping everything in sync easier than in Premiere. Final Cut Pro's interface is less configurable than Premiere's. You can't split panels off into windows, except for the Preview window, which is very spare in the control department—the only options are Play and Pause. Premiere offers a lot more here, with buttons for Export Frame, Extract, Go to In, Go to Previous Edit Point, Lift, and Step Back. As mentioned, Final Cut offers just three prebuilt workspaces (Color & Effects, Default, and Organize). Winner: Tie Like a traditional NLE, Premiere Pro lets you store related media in bins, which are similar to folders. As with folders, you can have bins within bins. You can also apply color labels to assets, but not keyword tags. The Libraries panel lets you share assets among other Adobe applications, such as After Effects and Photoshop. Apple's program organizes your media through events, keyword tagging, libraries, and roles. The library is the overarching container that includes your projects, events, and clips, and it keeps track of all your edits and options. You can also manage storage targets and perform batch clip renaming. Winner: Apple Final Cut Pro Premiere Pro works with pretty much any media format of any level of professionalism, as well as media type for which you installed codecs on your computer. That even includes Apple ProRes. The software supports working with native (raw) camera formats, including those for ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony. There's not much video you can create or import that Premiere can't handle. It even supports XML documents you export from Final Cut Pro.Final Cut Pro works with the HEVC codec that many 4K video cameras and Apple's iPhones use. Like Premiere Pro, Final Cut supports native formats from all the major video camera makers, including ARRI, Canon, Panasonic, RED, and Sony, as well as many video-capable still cameras. It, too, handles XML file imports and exports.Winner: Tie After Effects, Premiere's stablemate in the Creative Cloud ecosystem, is the industry-standard motion graphics tool. It dovetails smoothly with Premiere Pro but is more difficult to master than Apple Motion, which now has many of the same capabilities. Regardless, After Effects is the tool to learn if you want to pursue professional video editing as a career. The app costs $263.88 per year. Apple Motion is also a powerful tool for creating effects, titles, and transitions. It supports custom templates, logical layers, and a rich plug-in ecosystem. Motion is probably a better fit if you use Final Cut Pro as your primary editor. Even if you don't, it's just a one-time, $49.99 purchase.Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro The latest generative AI feature to land in Adobe's video software is Generative Extend, which creates extra video frames (including 4K) from the surrounding content for cases in which a clip isn't quite long enough to fit the rest of your timeline. Other Premiere Pro features include AI speech-to-text with automatic translation, color management that recognizes raw and log footage and automatically color-corrects it, and Media Intelligence, which recognizes clip contents to help you find them. Apple's pro video editor is playing catch-up with Premiere Pro. It now includes auto-captioning from speech in videos, but still lacks both text-based editing and video generation capabilities. It does, however, integrate with macOS's Image Playground to generate cartoon-like still images, for what that's worth. Magnetic Mask (apply effects just to fine-tuned masked areas) and Scene Removal round out some of the other recent AI tools in the app. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro includes the Lumetri Color tools. These are pro-level color grading features that were formerly part of the standalone SpeedGrade application. The Lumetri tools support 3D lookup tables (LUTs) for powerful and customizable looks. The tools offer a remarkable amount of color manipulation, along with a great selection of film and HDR looks. You can adjust black point, contrast, exposure, highlights, shadows, and white balance—all of which you can activate with keyframes. Faded Film, Saturation, Sharpen, and Vibrance adjustment presets are also available. Most impressive are the Color Wheel and Curves options. The Lumetri Scope view is also especially cool; it shows the current frame's proportional use of red, green, and blue. As mentioned, Premiere Pro includes a dedicated workspace for color editing. To compete with Adobe's impressive Lumetri Color tools, Final Cut has a Color Wheel tool that's impressive in its own right. Color Wheels show a puck in the middle that lets you move an image toward green, blue, or red; the result appears to the side of the wheel. You can also adjust brightness and saturation with the wheels, separately control everything (with the Master wheel), or adjust just shadows, midtones, or highlights. It's a remarkably powerful and intuitive set of tools. If wheels are not to your taste, the Color Board option shows a simple linear view of your color settings. The Color Curves tool lets you use multiple control points to adjust each of the three primary colors for very specific points on the brightness scale. Luma, RGB Parade, and Vectorscope monitors give you incredible insight into your movie's color usage. You can even edit a single color value using a dropper. Final Cut now supports color LUTs from camera manufacturers such as ARRI, Canon, Red, and Sony, as well as custom LUTs for effects. You can combine these effects with others in a stacked arrangement. Color scopes adapt to HDR editing, as do the color editing tools. Supported formats include Rec. 2020 HLG and Rec. 2020 PQ for HDR10 output.Winner: Tie Premiere offers Photoshop-like control over title text formatting, with a vast number of adjustments and fonts such as kerning, leading, rotation, shadow, stroking, and tracking, just to name a few. But for 3D manipulation, you need to head to After Effects. For captions, Premiere Pro is a hard act to follow: It not only creates captions from spoken words in your video, but, as mentioned, it also lets you edit based on the captions. As a result, you can take out ums and uhs in the video simply by removing the text from the caption. Premiere can then automatically translate the captions into 27 international languages and display multiple language tracks at once. Final Cut Pro includes strong 3D title editing with keyframe motion options. You get lots of control over title overlays, with dozens of animation templates. You edit text and position and size the titles right in the video preview; there's no need for an external title editor. Final Cut Pro's 3D Titles offer eight basic templates and four more cinematic ones, including a cool 3D Earth choice for sci-fi projects. There are 20 font presets, but you can use any style and size you like. Materials such as concrete, fabric, and plastic give your titles any texture you desire. You also get a bunch of lighting options. For maximum control, you can edit the 3D titles in Motion. Extrude 2D titles into 3D by tapping the 3D Text option in the Text Inspector, and you can then position and rotate the text to taste on three axes. Apple's software can now automatically transcribe spoken words in clips to text captions, but Premiere Pro goes way beyond that, identifying separate speakers, translating, and allowing text-based timeline editing. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Premiere Pro lets you play 360-degree VR footage and change the field of view and angle. You can watch this content in anaglyphic form, which is a fancy way of saying you can see it in 3D using standard red-and-blue glasses. You can also have your video track a head-mounted display's view. You can't use Premiere Pro (or Final Cut Pro) to edit 360-degree footage unless you stitch it into equirectangular format. Corel VideoStudio, CyberLink PowerDirector, and Pinnacle Studio can all open 360-degree footage without this conversion. You can't see the spherical view alongside the flattened view in Premiere like in those apps, but you can easily toggle between them if you add the VR button to the preview window. Helpfully, Premiere lets you tag a video as VR so that Facebook or YouTube can tell it's 360-degree content. Apple's pro video editor now has better 360-degree features, including support for Apple's VisionPro and the HTC Vive (sorry Meta Quest users). It offers 360-degree titles, some effects, and a nifty Patch tool that removes the camera and tripod from your movie. With the standalone Compressor app ($49.99), you can share 360-degree video directly to Facebook, Vimeo, and YouTube. You also get stabilization for 360-degree video. Winner: Tie Premiere Pro's Audio Mixer shows balance, mute/solo, clipping indicator, pan, volume unit (VU) meter controls for all timeline tracks. You can use it to make adjustments as the project plays. The app automatically creates new tracks when you drop an audio clip in the timeline, and you can specify types, such as 5.1, adaptive, mono, standard (which can contain a combination of mono and stereo files), and stereo. Double-clicking the VU meters or panning dials returns their levels to zero. The audio meters next to Premiere's timeline are resizable and let you solo any track. The program also supports hardware controllers and third-party VSP plug-ins. If you have Adobe Audition, you can round-trip your audio between that and Premiere Pro for advanced techniques such as adaptive noise reduction, automatic click removal, compression, parametric EQ, and studio reverb. Audio editing is a strength of Final Cut Pro. It can automatically fix hum, noise, and peaks, or you can manually take care of these problems. Over 1,300 royalty-free sound effects are available, as are a long list of plug-ins. One impressive trick is the ability to match separately recorded tracks. For example, if you shoot HD footage with a DSLR and record sound simultaneously on another recorder, the Match Audio feature aligns the sound source (Premiere Pro has a similar feature). Support for Apple Logic Pro plug-ins gives you even more powerful sound editing options. Finally, you get a surround-sound mixer to animate or locate 5.1 audio, as well as either a 10- or 31-band equalizer.Winner: Tie Premiere Pro offers more export formats than you are ever likely to need. You get even more options via the Media Encoder app, which can target Blu-ray, DVD, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo formats. Encoder lets you batch encode to target multiple devices in a single job, such as mobile phones, iPads, and HDTVs. Premiere can also output media using H.265 and the Rec. 2020 color space. Adobe's updated Export interface mode makes the process simpler yet more powerful; it lets you choose multiple social targets. Final Cut Pro's output options are comparatively limited unless you add the companion application, Apple Compressor. The base app can, however, export to XML and produce HDR, wide-color-space output including Rec. 2020 Hybrid Log Gamma and Rec. 2020 HDR10. Compressor adds the ability to customize output settings and perform batch output jobs. It also adds support for Blu-ray and DVD menus and chapter themes. You can even package movies in the format necessary for iTunes. Winner: Tie Like most modern video editors, Premiere Pro uses proxy views of your video content to speed up apparent performance, and I didn't encounter any lag while testing normal editing operations. The software takes advantage of graphics CUDA and OpenCL hardware acceleration and multicore CPUs with its Adobe Mercury Playback Engine. Premiere Pro locks the app during exporting by default, though you can get around this behavior by choosing Queue in the Export dialog via the Media Encoder app. One of the primary goals of Final Cut Pro is to take advantage of 64-bit processing and the newer Apple silicon chips. Conveniently, exporting in Final Cut happens in the background, so you can continue working in the program. I test export time by creating a 5-minute movie consisting of four clips of mixed types with a standard set of transitions. My test media files include some 8K and more 4K source clips. I render it to H.264 1080p, 60fps, using H.264 High Profile. The audio is AAC 192Kbps. For testing, I use a MacBook Air with an M1 processor and 8GB of RAM running macOS Sequoia. It's on the low end of power for video editing, so it shows differences more distinctly than more expensive hardware. Premiere Pro easily bested Final Cut Pro. The former completed the task in 170 seconds, while the latter required 205 seconds. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro Adobe maintains a large ecosystem of creative apps and services to support Premiere Pro. Aside from the Creative Cloud apps that work smoothly with Premiere, including After Effects, Audition, and Photoshop, Adobe offers the Premiere Rush mobile app, from which you can import projects. Adobe Express and Firefly, both of which you get with a Premiere subscription, include powerful AI video generation capabilities. Another app, Adobe Capture, lets you snap images for use as colors, shapes, and textures in Premiere Pro. Adobe's support for Frame.io collaboration and cloud storage is important for professional use. Other lesser-known Creative Cloud apps include Adobe Character Animator, a nifty app that produces animations based on live actors' faces and body movements, and Animate, which does the same for illustrations. You can bring both types of projects into Premiere Pro. Finally, the Adobe Stock integration comes in handy for those times you need B-roll or other stock media. Unfortunately, Stock is not part of a Premiere Pro subscription; plans start at $29.99 per month. It's a snap to import projects from iMovie on an iPhone or iPad into the pro editor, as mentioned. And that goes for the newer Final Cut Camera app, available on iPhone and iPad. The Final Cut iPad app ($4.99 per month) allows multicam shooting, as does the Camera app. The already-mentioned Motion and Compressor sibling applications, along with Apple's high-end sound editor, Logic Pro, extend the program's capabilities, but that collection of apps can't compete with Premiere Pro's. Winner: Adobe Premiere Pro PC hardware is nice, but it’s not much use without innovative software. I’ve been reviewing software for PCMag since 2008, and I still get a kick out of seeing what's new in video and photo editing software, and how operating systems change over time. I was privileged to byline the cover story of the last print issue of PC Magazine, the Windows 7 review, and I’ve witnessed every Microsoft win and misstep up to the latest Windows 11. I’m an avid bird photographer and traveler—I’ve been to 40 countries, many with great birds! Because I’m also a classical music fan and former performer, I’ve reviewed streaming services that emphasize classical music. PCMag is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

Title: Vornado Realty Trust Earnings Beat Estimates in Q1

Time Published: 2025-05-06T17:41:31Z
Full Content:
© 2025 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Vornado Realty Trust posted better-than-expected earnings results for the first quarter of 2025, and provided more details on its massive 70-year lease with New York University (NYU), sending its stock higher by more than 3 percent on Tuesday afternoon. The real estate giant reported quarterly funds from operations (FFO) of $126.2 million, or 63 cents per diluted share, above the 55 cents per diluted share reported for the same period last year and topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents per share. Net income for the first quarter was $86.8 million, or 43 cents per diluted share, above the net loss of 5 cents per diluted share for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue was $461.5 million for 2025’s first quarter, exceeding the $436.3 million reported for last year’s first quarter. It also beat the Zacks estimate by 3 percent. Vornado attributed its strong quarterly performance to the $350 million sale of a portion of Japanese clothing retailer Uniqlo’s flagship store at 666 Fifth Avenue in Midtown, the ground rent at its Penn 1 building being set nearly $11 million lower than Vornado expected — although at a price which is still under litigation — and strong leasing activity in Manhattan. “Manhattan continues to be the best real estate market in the country, especially so for office, but also for apartments and retail,” Steven Roth, CEO of Vornado, said on the company’s earnings call. “In the 180 million-square-foot Class A better building market in which we compete, demand continues to be robust.” On Monday, Vornado announced the completion of the 1.1 million-square-foot, 70-year master lease at 770 Broadway with NYU, which it first mentioned in November. The university made a prepaid lease payment of $935 million to Vornado and will make annual lease payments of $9.3 million for the entire life of the lease, Vornado said. Vornado was facing a hole in the property after Facebook parent Meta said it would drop 275,000 square feet once its lease expired, but NYU swooped in to take over the entire building. “We use a portion of the prepaid rent payment to repay the $700 million mortgage loan, which previously encumbered the property, and $200 million to increase our cash balances,” Roth said on the call. “Though, this transaction is a lease … it is treated as a sale.” Vornado had an active quarter of leasing activity across the retail and office space for the 2025 first quarter. The company leased 1.04 million square feet across its portfolio — 709,000 square feet of that in New York City — and commanded starting rents of $95 per square foot, Roth said. That includes the 337,000 square feet Universal Music signed at Penn 2. At the start of the earnings call, Roth acknowledged that the current macroeconomic environment is very different from its fourth-quarter earnings call in February. Still, despite political and economic uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump’s tariffs, Roth has a positive outlook going forward, saying tariffs could “make a big dent in getting our federal budget deficit under control.” “Notwithstanding the tactics, reducing government bloat has to be a good thing,” Roth said. “I am agnostic, whatever the outcome. I believe that this global kerfuffle will be resolved more quickly than you think.” Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Large AI Overviews on SERPs are affecting visibility and causing a dramatic decrease in traffic. Effective faceted navigation can support SEO – if implemented correctly. Learn how to avoid index bloat, crawl issues, and ranking setbacks. This week’s question tackles the potential SEO fallouts when implementing faceted navigation: “How can ecommerce sites implement SEO-friendly faceted navigation without hurting crawl efficiency or creating index bloat?” Faceted navigation is a game-changer for user experience (UX) on large ecommerce sites. It helps users quickly narrow down what they’re looking for, whether it’s a size 8 pair of red road running trainers for women, or a blue, waterproof winter hiking jacket for men. For your customers, faceted navigation makes huge inventories feel manageable and, when done right, enhances both UX and SEO. However, when these facets create a new URL for every possible filter combination, they can lead to significant SEO issues that harm your rankings, and waste valuable crawl budget if not managed properly. Faceted navigation issues often fly under the radar – until they start causing real SEO damage. The good news? You don’t need to be a tech wizard to spot the early warning signs. With the right tools and a bit of detective work, you can uncover whether filters are bloating your site, wasting crawl budget, or diluting rankings. Here’s a step-by-step approach to auditing your site for faceted SEO issues: Start by searching on Google with this query: site:yourdomain.com. This will show you all the URLs Google has indexed for your site. Review the list: If so, you may have index bloat. Check Google Search Console (GSC) for a clearer picture. Look under “Coverage” to see how many pages are indexed. Pay attention to the “Indexed, not submitted in sitemap” section for unintended filter-generated pages. Not all faceted navigation behaves the same. Make sure you understand how filters work on your site: Some faceted pages drive traffic; others burn crawl budget without returns. Use tools like Botify, Screaming Frog, or Ahrefs to compare Googlebot’s crawling behavior with actual organic visits. If a page gets crawled a lot but doesn’t attract visitors, it’s a sign that it’s consuming crawl resources unnecessarily. Run a crawler to scan your site’s URLs. Check for repetitive patterns, such as endless combinations of parameters like ?price=low&sort=best-sellers. These are potential crawler traps and unnecessary variations. To decide which SEO tactics to use for faceted navigation, assess the search demand for specific filters and whether unique content can be created for those variations. Use keyword research tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to check for user demand for specific filter combinations. For example: This helps prioritize which facet combinations should be indexed. If there’s enough value in targeting a specific query, such as product features, a dedicated URL may be worthwhile. However, low-value filters like price or size should remain no-indexed to avoid bloated indexing. The decision should balance the effort needed to create new URLs against the potential SEO benefits. Log files record every request, including those from search engine bots. By analyzing them, you can track which URLs Googlebot is crawling and how often, helping you identify wasted crawl budget on low-value pages. For example, if Googlebot is repeatedly crawling deep-filtered URLs like /jackets?size=large&brand=ASICS&price=100-200&page=12 with little traffic, that’s a red flag. Key signs of inefficiency include: By regularly checking your logs, you get a clear picture of Googlebot’s behavior, enabling you to optimize crawl budget and focus Googlebot’s attention on more valuable pages. Here’s how to keep things under control, so your site stays crawl-efficient and search-friendly. Start with the basics: Your facet labels should be intuitive. “Blue,” “Leather,” “Under £200” – these need to make instant sense to your users. Confusing or overly technical terms can lead to a frustrating experience and missed conversions. Not sure what resonates? Check out competitor sites and see how they’re labeling similar filters. Just because you can add 30 different filters doesn’t mean you should. Too many options can overwhelm users and generate thousands of unnecessary URL combinations. Stick to what genuinely helps customers narrow down their search. If your platform allows it, use clean, readable URLs for facets like /sofas/blue rather than messy query strings like ?color[blue]. Reserve query parameters for optional filters (e.g., sort order or availability), and don’t index those. Use canonical tags to point similar or filtered pages back to the main category/parent page. This helps consolidate link equity and avoid duplicate content issues. Just remember, canonical tags are suggestions, not commands. Google may ignore them if your filtered pages appear too different or are heavily linked internally. For any faceted pages you want indexed, these should include a self-referencing canonical, and for any that don’t, canonicalize these to the parent page. Break your URLs into three clear groups: No matter the order in which users apply filters, the resulting URL should be consistent. For example, /trainers/blue/leather and /trainers/leather/blue should result in the same URL, or else you’ll end up with duplicate content that dilutes SEO value. One way to reduce unnecessary crawling is by blocking faceted URLs through your robots.txt file. That said, it’s important to know that robots.txt is more of a polite request than a strict rule. Search engines like Google typically respect it, but not all bots do, and some may interpret the syntax differently. To prevent search engines from crawling pages you don’t want indexed, it’s also smart to ensure those pages aren’t linked to internally or externally (e.g., backlinks). If search engines find value in those pages through links, they might still crawl or index them, even with a disallow rule in place. Here’s a basic example of how to block a faceted URL pattern using the robots.txt file. Suppose you want to stop crawlers from accessing URLs that include a color parameter: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* In this rule: However, if your faceted navigation requires a more nuanced approach, such as blocking most color options but allowing specific ones, you’ll need to mix Disallow and Allow rules. For instance, to block all color parameters except for “black,” your file might include: User-agent: * Disallow: /*color* Allow: /*color=black* A word of caution: This strategy only works well if your URLs follow a consistent structure. Without clear patterns, it becomes harder to manage, and you risk accidentally blocking key pages or leaving unwanted URLs crawlable. If you’re working with complex URLs or an inconsistent setup, consider combining this with other techniques like meta noindex tags or parameter handling in Google Search Console. Internal links signal importance to search engines. So, if you link frequently to faceted URLs that are canonicalized or blocked, you’re sending mixed signals. Consider using rel=”nofollow” on links you don’t want crawled – but be cautious. Google treats nofollow as a hint, not a rule, so results may vary. Point to only canonical URLs within your website wherever possible. This includes dropping parameters and slugs from links that are not necessary for your URLs to work. You should also prioritize pillar pages; the more inlinks a page has, the more authoritative search engines will deem that page to be. In 2019, Google’s John Mueller said: “In general, we ignore everything after hash… So things like links to the site and the indexing, all of that will be based on the non hash URL. And if there are any links to the hashed URL, then we will fold up into the non hash URL.” Track which filters users actually engage with, and which lead to conversions. If no one ever uses the “beige” filter, it may not deserve crawlable status. Use tools like Google Analytics 4 or Hotjar to see what users care about and streamline your navigation accordingly. When a filtered page returns no results, respond with a 404 status, unless it’s a temporary out-of-stock issue, in which case show a friendly message stating so, and return a 200. This helps avoid wasting crawl budget on thin content. When you interact with a page – say, filtering a product list, selecting a color, or typing in a live search box – AJAX lets the site fetch or send data behind the scenes, so the rest of the page stays put. It can be really effective to implement facets client-side via AJAX, which doesn’t create multiple URLs for every filter change. This reduces unnecessary load on the server and improves performance. Faceted navigation often leads to large sets of results, which naturally introduces pagination (e.g., ?category=shoes&page=2). But when combined with layered filters, these paginated URLs can balloon into thousands of crawlable variations. Left unchecked, this can create serious crawl and index bloat, wasting search engine resources on near-duplicate pages. So, should paginated URLs be indexed? In most cases, no. Pages beyond the first page rarely offer unique value or attract meaningful traffic, so it’s best to prevent them from being indexed while still allowing crawlers to follow links. The standard approach here is to use noindex, follow on all pages after page 1. This ensures your deeper pagination doesn’t get indexed, but search engines can still discover products via internal links. When it comes to canonical tags, you’ve got two options depending on the content. If pages 2, 3, and so on are simply continuations of the same result set, it makes sense to canonicalize them to page 1. This consolidates ranking signals and avoids duplication. However, if each paginated page features distinct content or meaningful differences, a self-referencing canonical might be the better fit. The key is consistency – don’t mix page 2 canonical to page 1 and page 3 to itself, for example. About rel=”next” and rel=”prev,” while Google no longer uses these signals for indexing, they still offer UX benefits and remain valid HTML markup. They also help communicate page flow to accessibility tools and browsers, so there’s no harm in including them. To help control crawl depth, especially in large ecommerce sites, it’s wise to combine pagination handling with other crawl management tactics: For example, a faceted URL like /trainers?color=white&brand=asics&page=3 would typically: Handling pagination well is just as important as managing the filters themselves. It’s all part of keeping your site lean, crawlable, and search-friendly. When properly managed, faceted navigation can be an invaluable tool for improving user experience, targeting long-tail keywords, and boosting conversions. However, without the right SEO strategy in place, it can quickly turn into a crawl efficiency nightmare that damages your rankings. By following the best practices outlined above, you can enjoy all the benefits of faceted navigation while avoiding the common pitfalls that often trip up ecommerce sites.

Title: Meta's layoffs were supposed to target low performers. These employees share how it felt to them.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-layoffs-low-performance-cuts-review-cycle-politics-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-05-06T09:00:01Z
Full Content:
Months after Meta's high-profile culling of low performers, the stigma associated with the job cuts still stings. CEO Mark Zuckerberg's push to "raise the bar on performance" saw about 5% of its workforce — roughly 3,600 employees — laid off in a sweeping round of cuts in February. The company said it targeted its lowest performers, but some former employees pushed back on that. Some said they had received positive ratings months earlier. Others said they were on medical or parental leave, mid-transfer between teams, or hadn't received a formal rating yet. Some speculated that conflict with a manager was the deciding factor. As of late April, laid-off employees received severance payouts. The eight accounts below offer a sense of how employees who were let go experienced the cuts and their concern about how it could affect their futures. BI has verified the performance records of these ex-workers, who asked for anonymity because they fear the "low performer" label could hurt future job prospects. A Meta spokesperson reiterated what the company previously shared with BI earlier this year about its low-performer cuts: "Let me be clear, these were performance-based terminations," the spokesperson said. "Prior ratings were not downgraded. Simply because someone had a history of meeting or exceeding expectations does not mean they continue to consistently meet the bar." The spokesperson added that Meta employees are held accountable to a goal-based culture of high performance. A former employee in Meta's human resources division had returned to work after being on parental leave for nearly five months when his division lost close to 10% of its staff. His midyear review put him "At or Above Expectations" — the middle tier — but his year-end rating was "Meets Most," which made him eligible for termination. "I tried calling my boss immediately, but in my heart, I knew it probably wasn't an error — Meta wouldn't make a mistake that significant." He said the manager was distressed but repeated: "I can't say anything. It's just part of Mark's mandate. It's a hard year." He said he didn't know why his rating had fallen. "We can't even see the feedback our managers wrote for us," he said. "Once the shock wore off, there was actually a mix of emotions — including some relief at being freed from that situation." But he does worry about carrying the low-performer label. "It's one thing to be let go in a restructuring," he said. "It's another to have your professional reputation potentially damaged by being mischaracterized as an underperformer." A former senior machine learning engineer at Meta described the shock of being laid off, only for a Meta recruiter to invite her to reapply three days later and skip the interview process. "Same email address. Same person. No acknowledgment of what had just happened. It felt surreal," she said. She said she joined Meta in early 2024 and earned a midyear review of "At or Above Expectations." Initially rated "Meets All Expectations" in the January 2025 year-end review, she was downgraded to "Meets Most Expectations" after a second round of director-level reviews. She said she suspects "directors were under pressure to hit a layoff quota." Before the layoff, she was dissatisfied with her manager and sought a transfer to a top-tier team. It was approved, but she was told the move could lower her rating, so she waited — only to be pink-slipped. She said she's not taking the recruiter up on her offer. Ultimately, she's confident she can land or create her next opportunity. "I'll be fine. I can get another job or start something of my own." This software engineer who joined Meta in May 2024 to work on cross-platform content sharing said a promising start unraveled because of internal politics over a new feature he prototyped. He said he took a four-month leave for burnout in August and returned in December to complete two more projects. Two weeks before the layoffs, he said, his new manager told the team everyone was "safe." Then came the termination email — and a performance rating of "Meets Some Expectations," low on Meta's end-of-year rating scale. "How could they evaluate my performance when I'd only worked 10 weeks in 2024?" he said, adding that an HR director had said he was "too new to evaluate." Although he's now fielding interest from other companies and expects to receive 16 weeks of severance, he still feels the sting of his rating. "The harmful 'low performer' label still feels wrong," he said. This product manager joined Facebook as a contractor in 2018, converted to full time in 2020, and consistently received a year-end "Greatly Exceeds Expectations" ratings label. In 2023, when she moved to Reality Labs, "everything changed," she said. "My manager would call late at night to question my capabilities and create doubt, even though teammates gave me positive feedback," she said. A review in early 2024 dropped her two tiers to "Meets All Expectations." Feedback included accusations that she was "blinded" by a "desire for promotion," she said. In August, she took a 12-week disability leave "because I was physically ill from all the stress." She returned in November and was laid off in February. She's being "selective" in her hunt for a new job. "The experience damaged my health, affected my family, and forced me onto medication for anxiety. I need to walk away from toxicity at the first sign, not wait until it affects my health and family again." A technical program manager was laid off after seven years of good performance ratings at Meta. A reorganization placed her under a new manager a few months earlier — a shift she felt exposed her. "When managers have to meet quotas and choose someone to cut, people with less history on the team are at higher risk," she said. "I contacted my manager in shock" after the termination notice, she said. "I just wanted five minutes to talk to ensure I wasn't going crazy." The manager responded with a templated email — the same company-approved language she had been required to use the day before when laying off her own direct report. She still doesn't know exactly what led to their selection. "Was it because I had significant equity vested when the stock price was low?" she said. " Was it because I expressed disappointment about Meta rolling back DEI programs on internal forums? I'll never know — but there's clearly more to this story than simply cutting the lowest performers." After 14 years at Google and three at Meta, a program manager said she was laid off despite a strong performance record: "At Meta, I'd even received 'Exceeds Expectations' and the rare 'Redefines Expectations.'" She said her manager told her she was doing "a great job" at the midyear review. "I was candid with my manager — sometimes critically, but always constructively — about where I thought things could improve," she said. "I was transparent about how stress in my personal life was affecting me: My husband had been laid off, and we were caring for a special-needs child." She said her manager told her not to worry, but she'd noticed a shift in tone at Meta — for example, when chief technology officer Andrew "Boz" Bosworth said a worker who alleged mistreatment should just quit. "The compassionate tone of the 2022 layoffs — the regret, the messaging about hard decisions — feels like a distant memory," she said. "This round was cutthroat. Silent. Cold. 'The Hunger Games,' but for high performers." "I wrote a final email to my skip-level manager," she added. "Not to get my job back. Not even to get a reply (I didn't). I just wanted to be heard. To say: I know I did good work. I know I didn't deserve this. And I hope someone — anyone — in leadership still has the humanity to care." This employee spent years working on critical internal systems. In the days before the layoffs, he focused on ensuring everything would run smoothly. He had received consistently strong performance ratings and said his managers agreed he was on track, but his termination letter assigned him a "Meets Most Expectations" rating. He said his managers didn't look at the self-review he submitted. "That told me everything. This wasn't about performance," he said. "This was about filling quotas." The manager expressed support for the decision, but said there were constraints around time and communication. In his view, the company culture had grown increasingly cutthroat, with employees clinging to projects to boost their ratings, jockeying within the performance curve, and seeing dissent increasingly punished. "Many people stay because the compensation is hard to walk away from, not because they believe in the mission. I was one of them. It was a place that offered scale and learning, but at a steep emotional cost," he said, adding that his healthy salary would have made him "an easy target" for cost-cutters. An engineer was laid off after five months of leave for a serious health crisis while in the middle of disability-related negotiations. He said his final performance rating — "Meets Most Expectations" — felt like "a scarlet letter." "I wasn't underperforming," he said. Peer reviews before the leave had been entirely positive, and he saved "screenshots of it all for my lawyer." His compensation exceeded $500,000, making him the highest-paid person on the team after his manager. He said he worked 60 to 75 hours before falling ill, but he sensed resentment after raising burnout concerns and stepping away from a major project. "And after the layoff? Nothing. My manager didn't even say goodbye." He said Meta's branding of laid-off workers as low performers "sets a dangerous precedent — companies can quietly rewrite the story of your career, and you don't get to fight back." He's exploring legal options. "Meta is telling one story," he said. "And for many of us, it's not the truth." Have a tip?

Title: Deliveroo deal shows UK still can't hang on to big firms
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp22d2kexo
Time Published: 2025-05-06T08:00:05Z

The takeover of Deliveroo by its US counterpart DoorDash is an illuminating example of the differing fortunes and attractions of US and UK stock markets. DoorDash's offer for Deliveroo values the business at £2.9bn and will create a company with operations in more than 40 countries. While both are similar companies, their fortunes have dramatically diverged over the past few years. Both started out as food delivery services offering customers convenient and speedy access to their favourite restaurants and offering restaurants the ability to more fully utilise the capacity of their kitchens. Both extended their offerings to include other convenience shopping items – like nappies, flowers and pet food. Both raised money by selling shares to the public in an initial public offering (IPO) around the same time – Deliveroo on the London stock market, DoorDash on the New York Stock Exchange. But when Deliveroo listed its shares in London, DoorDash was worth five times as much as its UK counterpart. Four years later DoorDash was worth 35 times as much. This is not a perfect comparison as DoorDash has issued more shares to raise money to expand over time which would boost its total value – its market capitalisation. But the appetite for shares in the US company meant that it could successfully raise that money on US markets. Let's look at another measure – the price of each share. An investor who bought a share of DoorDash has seen its value rise 84%. An investor who bought a share of Deliveroo has seen its value fall 56%. What this means is that DoorDash is now in a position to use its greater financial heft to take over its UK rival – just as Deliveroo is finally turning a profit. One of Deliveroo's first backers, Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, told the BBC in 2023 that if he had his time again he would have voted for a US listing, and people close to the company agree that the current takeover bid was partly enabled by DoorDash's access to US capital markets. This is just one example which helps explain a wider problem. Companies are increasingly shunning the London stock market in favour of a US listing. There are many reasons. Higher valuation. The 500 largest publicly traded US companies (S&P 500) are worth, on average, 28 times the profit they make in a year. The 100 largest publicly traded UK companies (the FTSE 100) sell for 12 times their yearly earnings. Less than half. How can there be such a huge disparity? Partly because the US is home to most of the world's most successful and profitable companies – the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla) Take those out and shares trade at 20 times earnings – still a massive premium to the UK. One of the other reasons UK valuations lag is old-fashioned lack of demand. UK investors' appetite for UK stocks has shrivelled. Over the last 30 years, the share of the UK market owned by UK financial institutions has shrunk from 50% to less than 5%. This is partly because financial regulation has encouraged pension funds to buy less risky investments like government bonds. But it's also partly because the managers of those pension funds think they will get better returns investing in US markets – and they have been dead right. In just the last five years, the total return including dividends on investing in US shares has been 116% while the same number for the UK is 45%. But there are changes afoot. The government's so-called "Edinburgh Reforms", designed to make listing in the UK more attractive, included reducing the proportion of a company available for sale to the public and retaining more voting power for founders who wanted to keep control of the company even as they sold stakes to others. There have also been positive comments on the attractiveness of the UK from financial giants like Larry Fink of BlackRock and Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan. They both noted the UK looks undervalued and the UK market has outperformed the US so far this year. The secret that UK stocks are cheap has been out there for some time. That is precisely why private buyers from the US and elsewhere have swooped on UK-listed companies meaning they disappear from the UK stock market. Even some of the biggest ones left are considered candidates for a move. Shell boss Wael Sawan told the BBC that while he had "no immediate" plans to move, he and his company "got a very warm welcome" when they held their big reception for investors in New York. Shell trades at a 35% discount to its US-listed peers and many of its shareholders aren't happy about it. What the DoorDash swoop on Deliveroo seems to highlight once again is that companies listed in the US can summon greater financial firepower with which to expand or acquire their rivals. Deliveroo will join the likes of Arm Holdings, Morrisons, CRH Holdings, Ultra, Meggitt and many others as companies who used to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. Does it matter? Pension funds, or individual investors, can buy shares whether they are listed in the UK, US or one of the European exchanges. But a UK listing generates significant ancillary business for a UK financial services industry that still makes up more than 10% of the UK's entire economy and contributes more than 10% of all taxes paid here. Accountants, lawyers, financial PR firms and others feed off the fees that UK listings generate. Trading on the London Stock Exchange is dwarfed by the trading of currencies, bonds and complex contracts but it has always been a centre of gravity for financial activity and one which many argue has lost its power to attract. The deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US rival. Oury Amadou Diallo, 22, did not have licence for modified bike classed as motorcycle, court hears. David Nicholson rents a school kitchen out of hours and cooks meals that are sold on Deliveroo app. Councillors say action is needed from companies to avoid the safety risks being posed to shoppers. Illegally converted bikes are linked to fires while charging, often overnight in users' homes. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.

CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and March 26, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=146628&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

May 05, 2025 09:10 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, May 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com | 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

Time Published: 2025-05-05T09:00:00Z

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

On April 2, President Trump stunned the markets by announcing unexpectedly steep tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. The reaction was swift and severe — the S&P 500 plummeted nearly 12%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost about 4,600 points in just four days. The sudden escalation raised fears that Trump was willing to risk a recession to reshape the global trade landscape.(Source: AP) Despite the initial crash, the U.S. stock market began to recover quickly. By early May, the S&P 500 had climbed back to the levels seen on April 2. While still over 7% below its all-time high, the market’s rapid bounce-back was just as unexpected and dramatic as the fall that preceded it. A major turning point came on April 9 when Trump announced a “90-day PAUSE” on most tariffs, excluding those targeting China. This announcement led to a massive one-day rally, with the S&P 500 jumping 9.5% — one of its best performances ever. However, controversy followed as Trump had posted on Truth Social earlier that day calling it a “great time to buy,” raising questions about timing and market influence. Following the pause, the market saw a mix of optimism and confusion. Trump spoke about both negotiating and enforcing tariffs to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., a seemingly contradictory stance. Still, signs of easing tensions, particularly with China, and the reduction of tariffs on cars and consumer electronics helped calm some investor nerves. The sharp stock selloff after "Liberation Day" also shook other financial markets. U.S. Treasury bond prices fell, and the dollar weakened, reflecting a loss of investor confidence in America’s financial safety. Trump himself acknowledged that bond market jitters contributed to his decision to delay tariffs, as investors grew increasingly uneasy. Despite shaken consumer confidence, economic data painted a stronger picture. April saw 177,000 new jobs added, supporting the view that the economy remained resilient. The Federal Reserve, which had already cut rates three times in late 2024, chose to hold steady, watching the evolving impact of trade policy. Nonetheless, markets continue to price in the likelihood of three more cuts by year-end. Even amid uncertainty, U.S. companies have posted surprisingly strong earnings. Nearly 75% of S&P 500 firms, including giants like Microsoft and Meta, beat profit expectations, with overall earnings growth nearing 13%. However, many CEOs are hesitant about the future, offering cautious or dual forecasts — as United Airlines did — due to unpredictable trade policies. With the tariff pause nearing expiration, volatility could return swiftly if no lasting agreements are reached.

After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha. Attendees of the shareholders’ meeting on May 3, 2025, quickly realized they were witnessing a turning point: At 94, Warren Buffett announced his resignation as chairman. By year’s end, 62-year-old Canadian Greg Abel, currently vice chairman for non-insurance operations, will take the reins. This will take some getting used to, as Buffett is a stock market institution, a calming force in the frenetic world of Wall Street, from which he maintained a safe distance -- not just geographically, with his base in far-off Nebraska. Buffett shaped the investment landscape like few others over his 63-year tenure. His strategy was clear-cut: a heavy focus on equity investments in U.S. market leaders, almost entirely eschewing bonds, and aligning the fund’s cash position with the waves of the credit cycle. Berkshire cashed out investments when strategically prudent or when the economy’s credit engine overheated. This disciplined oscillation between U.S. dollar reserves and aggressive equity buildups after market corrections has outperformed the classic 60/40 stock-bond portfolio by leaps and bounds. A deep understanding of economic cycles, industry growth, and specific company valuations forged an unbeatable alliance that turned countless loyal shareholders into millionaires. Embedded in the Bretton Woods Framework With an estimated fortune of $160 billion, Buffett, the world’s fifth-richest person, remained true to himself. His conservative investment style is mirrored in his personal life: no scandals, three children from two marriages, and he still lives in the Omaha house he bought in 1958. In soccer terms, his strategy might be called a “controlled offensive.” Buffett’s investment thesis was rooted in the post-war Bretton Woods order, betting on the dominant U.S. market -- and he was spot-on. The U.S. dollar’s dominance remains unbroken, still a safe-haven currency in crises. U.S. companies like Apple, Domino’s Pizza, or Chevron lead their market segments, aided by a U.S. regulatory framework that welcomes foreign capital with open arms. In short, Buffett’s framework: Capital is mobile, the U.S. offers an open market system combining liquidity and growth, and the domestic currency, as a cash buffer, never faced serious devaluation risks compared to global competitors. This stability was underpinned by decades of U.S. interventionist foreign policy, leaving no room for doubt. Berkshire became a meta-investment structure, enabling retail investors to back the U.S. market as a whole through government-backed stock ownership programs. Monetary Policy as a Multiplier Berkshire also capitalized on another insight: Investment success hinges not only on analysis but also on systemic factors. These lie in the design of the global monetary order. With the end of the gold standard in 1971 (Nixon Shock), global credit creation accelerated. Since then, the global money supply (M2 -- cash, checking deposits, and short-term savings) has grown by an average of 6.9% annually. The fiat standard -- credit creation without full backing by assets like gold or commodities -- unleashed waves of liquidity. These inflated nominal asset valuations, turning assets like real estate into “savings banks” to preserve purchasing power against currency devaluation. Buffett recognized this liquidity mechanism, effectively “front-running” the money-printing machine with his investment style. A New Investment Regime The handover comes amid significant geopolitical upheaval. With his tariff push, U.S. President Donald Trump has exposed a long-simmering issue: a crisis in U.S. Treasuries as a globally accepted safe asset. Markets are now pricing new risk premiums into asset classes. Volatility is rising, and governments, central banks, and major capital pools are increasingly eyeing safe-haven assets like gold and Bitcoin. Capital rotation into these assets reflects efforts to reduce credit default risks, which lurk like a ticking time bomb under traditional portfolio structures. How will Berkshire Hathaway navigate geopolitical uncertainty and inflation risks? During the COVID lockdowns and expansive monetary policy, Buffett foresaw rising inflation and briefly positioned Berkshire in the gold sector, investing in Barrick Gold in 2020 -- a notable move for the traditionally gold-skeptical Buffett. Yet, by Q4 of that year, the firm exited the position. This brief gold foray and swift retreat seem, in hindsight, like an acknowledgment of an emerging monetary system crisis. However, Buffett’s team may have been reluctant to admit that a radical devaluation of dollar collateral -- a potential regime change -- was already underway. Will Berkshire steer toward safe havens? The question looms: How will the new leadership under Greg Abel handle safe-haven assets in a shifting global landscape? Will Omaha continue to bet on U.S. policy’s ability to consolidate budgets and fiscal frameworks in the spirit of free markets? And will it trust in a U.S. economic comeback under President Trump? Financial analysts, media, and policymakers will closely watch the strategic decisions of Berkshire’s new leadership. For Berkshire’s over one million shareholders worldwide, Buffett’s exit marks the start of a new chapter, fueled by hope that the controlled offensive that made the firm strong will succeed in the evolving financial world. The meeting closed with a cryptic remark from the Oracle of Omaha. Commenting on recent trade policy developments and current crises, Buffett hinted: “It may be that things happen in the United States that cause us to own a lot of other currencies.” Time will tell how this pointed warning will manifest in Berkshire’s portfolio in the months ahead. Image: USA International Trade Administration After over six decades at the helm of Berkshire Hathaway, the end of this year marks the finale: Investment legend Warren Buffett is stepping down. Buffett weathered market storms and geopolitical turbulence by translating the Bretton Woods order into a consistent portfolio strategy. As always, it was business as usual: Around 20,000 Berkshire shareholders filled the CHI Health Center in Omaha, Nebraska, to capacity -- the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders’ meeting was underway. Known in investment circles as the “Woodstock” of investors, the event traditionally unfolds as a whirlwind tour through the American economy. The accompanying exhibition of Berkshire’s investments showcases what resonates with American consumers: Apple, Coca-Cola, Kraft Heinz, or American Express -- a veritable trade show of national brand leaders. Here, retail and institutional investors alike are reassured that Omaha remains true to its roots: conservative, grounded, quintessentially American, and always in tune with the consumer. This strategy has been managed from Berkshire’s headquarters at Blackstone Plaza. This approach has propelled Berkshire’s stock to a staggering 4.4 million percent increase since its transformation from a textile company into an investment fund in 1962. The never-split original share recently hit a price of $800,000 -- a figure worthy of the Guinness Book of Records. By comparison, the broad S&P 500 index “only” grew by 31,000 percent over the same period. A Routine with a Bombshell Let’s pause the number games and return to Omaha.

May 04, 2025 08:47 ET | Source: Nitric Boost Nitric Boost NEW YORK, May 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- If you’re searching for the best nitric oxide supplements for men, you're not alone. In 2025, nitric oxide (NO) boosters are among the most in-demand health products for men looking to enhance blood flow, energy, athletic performance, and even support for erectile dysfunction (ED). But what exactly is nitric oxide, and why does it matter so much? Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring molecule in your body that plays a crucial role in vascular health. It helps relax and dilate blood vessels, allowing for improved circulation—a function that impacts everything from your stamina at the gym to your performance in the bedroom. Unfortunately, as men age, natural NO production declines, often leading to fatigue, reduced endurance, poor muscle recovery, and even symptoms of ED. That’s where nitric oxide supplements come in. Designed to stimulate NO production through ingredients like L-arginine, L-citrulline, and beetroot extract, these supplements help improve oxygen delivery, nutrient flow, and vascular function. Whether you're an athlete chasing better pumps or someone looking to restore youthful energy and performance, the right nitric oxide booster can make a major difference. And among the dozens of options on the market, one supplement continues to lead the pack in 2025… Enter: Nitric Boost Ultra — a cutting-edge NO supplement formulated for maximum blood flow, energy, and erectile support. This guide explores the science behind nitric oxide, the benefits it delivers for men’s health, and why Nitric Boost Ultra stands out as the best nitric oxide supplement for energy, endurance, and ED support this year. Meet Nitric Boost Ultra – The Best Nitric Oxide Supplement for Men When it comes to choosing the best nitric oxide supplement for men, Nitric Boost Ultra consistently ranks as the top choice in 2025. This advanced formula is specifically engineered to support optimal blood flow, muscle pumps, stamina, and erectile health — making it a powerful ally for any man looking to reclaim energy, confidence, and vitality. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Stands Out Unlike generic NO boosters, Nitric Boost Ultra goes beyond basic L-arginine formulas.

Tribulus Terrestris Primary Function: Supports testosterone and libidoThis herbal extract may help boost natural testosterone levels, which can enhance libido, energy, and muscle strength. When paired with improved blood flow, it amplifies both sexual and athletic performance. Pine Bark Extract (Pycnogenol) Primary Function: Enhances nitric oxide retentionKnown for its antioxidant properties, pine bark extract helps sustain nitric oxide levels in the blood longer, leading to better vascular tone, improved erectile quality, and faster post-exercise recovery. Niacin (Vitamin B3) Primary Function: Improves blood vessel flexibilityNiacin supports vascular health by reducing inflammation and improving blood lipid profiles. It works synergistically with the other ingredients to optimize circulation and reduce fatigue. Why This Blend Works: This unique combination addresses every aspect of nitric oxide production and utilization — from boosting initial levels to sustaining them longer and improving blood vessel responsiveness.

Try it today! How Nitric Oxide Works – The Science Behind NO Boosters Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally occurring molecule in the human body, essential for many physiological processes — especially those tied to circulation, energy, and male performance. Understanding how nitric oxide works helps explain why supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra have become the go-to solution for men looking to improve stamina, blood flow, and even erectile dysfunction (ED). What Is Nitric Oxide (NO)? Nitric oxide is a vasodilator — a compound that signals blood vessels to relax and widen. This increased vessel diameter allows more blood, oxygen, and nutrients to flow to vital areas of the body. NO is synthesized from amino acids like L-Arginine and L-Citrulline and is crucial for: How Nitric Oxide Boosters Work Nitric oxide supplements — like Nitric Boost Ultra — work by supplying the body with precursors that stimulate NO production naturally. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works: 1. L-Arginine & L-Citrulline These amino acids are converted into nitric oxide via the endothelial cells lining your blood vessels. This process leads to: 2. Beet Root & Other Plant-Based Boosters Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which convert into nitric oxide through a different pathway — the nitrate-nitrite-NO cycle. This dual approach provides: 3. Synergistic Support from Key Vitamins & Botanicals Ingredients like Niacin (Vitamin B3) help relax blood vessels and improve lipid profiles, while herbs like Tribulus Terrestris and Pine Bark Extract boost natural testosterone and enhance libido — making NO boosters even more effective for male sexual health. Fast-Acting, Long-Lasting Results Once taken, NO boosters quickly absorb into the bloodstream and start enhancing circulation within hours. Over time, consistent use: Nitric Boost Ultra works on all these mechanisms, making it one of the top-rated nitric oxide supplements for men who want to optimize blood flow, muscle function, and sexual performance without pharmaceuticals or side effects. Clinical Studies Supporting Nitric Oxide Supplementation 1. L-Citrulline and Erectile Function A study published in Urology investigated the effects of oral L-citrulline supplementation on men with mild erectile dysfunction (ED). In this single-blind study, participants received a placebo for one month followed by L-citrulline (1.5 g/day) for another month. The results showed that 50% of the men experienced an improvement in erection hardness from a score of 3 (mild ED) to 4 (normal erectile function) during the L-citrulline phase, compared to only 8.3% during the placebo phase. Additionally, the mean number of intercourses per month increased significantly with L-citrulline supplementation. Another study explored the combination of L-citrulline and transresveratrol in men with ED who were already using phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5i). This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover pilot study found that the combination therapy significantly improved erectile function compared to placebo, suggesting a potential synergistic effect. 2. Beetroot Juice and Blood Pressure A systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of nitrate-rich beetroot juice on blood pressure in individuals with arterial hypertension. The analysis included seven studies with a total of 218 participants. The findings indicated that beetroot juice supplementation led to a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by approximately 4.95 mmHg. However, the effect on diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was not statistically significant. Another study focused on the acute and short-term effects of nitrate-rich beetroot juice ingestion in postmenopausal women with arterial hypertension. The results demonstrated that both acute and one-week supplementation enhanced cardiovascular responses following aerobic exercise, highlighting the potential benefits of beetroot juice in this population. Nitric Boost Ultra vs Other Top Nitric Oxide Supplements When it comes to nitric oxide supplements, not all formulas are created equal. While many products claim to boost nitric oxide levels, only a few deliver clinically effective doses, proven ingredients, and measurable results. Here's how Nitric Boost Ultra compares head-to-head with other top-rated nitric oxide boosters in the market. Ingredients & Clinical Doses Nitric Boost Ultra stands out for including clinically validated doses of L-Arginine and L-Citrulline, the two most important amino acids involved in nitric oxide synthesis. Unlike other products that use proprietary blends or underdose key ingredients, Nitric Boost Ultra clearly lists: Most competitors—like SuperBeets or Neo40—rely heavily on beetroot alone, without the dual-action benefits of arginine + citrulline. Pre-workout formulas like N.O. XT may include these aminos but often at lower or less bioavailable doses. Delivery Method Nitric Boost Ultra is delivered in easy-to-swallow capsules, optimized for gradual absorption and longer-lasting effects. This method avoids the rapid spike and crash often experienced with lozenges, powders, or sugary beet-based drinks. Nitric Boost Ultra's capsule format ensures no mess, no mixing, and no blood sugar spikes—just smooth, consistent nitric oxide support throughout the day. Third-Party Testing & Purity Purity and transparency are key when choosing a top nitric oxide booster. Nitric Boost Ultra is: Many other brands skip third-party testing or hide their ingredient doses behind proprietary blends. With Nitric Boost Ultra, what you see is what you get—no fillers, no gimmicks. Price vs. Value While some nitric oxide supplements may seem cheaper upfront, they often cut corners on ingredient quality or dosing. Nitric Boost Ultra offers premium ingredients, clinical dosing, and a comprehensive formula that supports: And all of this is backed by a 60-day money-back guarantee—making it a risk-free investment in your health. Bottom Line: Why Nitric Boost Ultra Leads the Pack If you’re seeking the best nitric oxide supplement for men’s health, especially for ED support, energy, and peak performance, Nitric Boost Ultra delivers where others fall short. With clinical dosing, clean formulation, and proven ingredients, it’s engineered for real results—not just hype. Order Nitric Boost Ultra now and experience the nitric oxide difference Health Benefits of Nitric Oxide Supplements for Men When it comes to men’s health, few compounds are as impactful as nitric oxide (NO). As a key signaling molecule, NO plays a vital role in blood vessel dilation, oxygen delivery, cellular energy, and hormone regulation. The best nitric oxide supplements for men, like Nitric Boost Ultra, are formulated to elevate your performance in all areas — from the gym to the bedroom. Here are the top science-backed health benefits: 1. Enhanced Blood Flow & Circulation The #1 benefit of nitric oxide supplements is vasodilation — the widening of blood vessels. This leads to: When blood flows more freely, every system in the body works more efficiently. 2. Erectile Dysfunction Support Nitric oxide is essential for achieving and maintaining an erection. In fact, it’s the same mechanism targeted by ED medications: This makes NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra one of the best nitric oxide supplements for ED available today. 3.

Feel stronger, think clearer, and live better — take charge of your health with Nitric Boost Ultra today. Nitric Oxide Benefits for Males – Why It Matters Most After 40 As men age, their bodies experience a gradual decline in nitric oxide (NO) production — a key molecule that affects everything from blood circulation to sexual health, muscle performance, and even heart function. By the time you reach 40 and beyond, this drop in NO can begin to show up in ways that directly impact your quality of life. That’s where nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra come in. These boosters are specifically designed to replenish NO levels and restore youthful performance across multiple health areas. 1. Improved Erectile Function and Sexual Vitality One of the most talked-about nitric oxide benefits for males is its direct link to stronger, longer-lasting erections. NO relaxes blood vessels and improves blood flow — a critical factor in achieving and maintaining erections. Men over 40 often experience ED or performance issues not due to lack of desire, but because blood flow is compromised. A high-quality nitric oxide booster for ED, such as Nitric Boost Ultra: This makes nitric oxide one of the best natural alternatives to ED medications — without harsh side effects. 2. Cardiovascular Health and Blood Pressure Support After 40, men are more susceptible to hypertension, heart disease, and circulatory issues. Since nitric oxide plays a key role in vasodilation (the widening of blood vessels), boosting NO levels can: Regular use of nitric oxide supplements has been associated with better heart performance and lower vascular resistance, helping you age with strength and resilience. 3. Enhanced Physical Performance and Muscle Recovery Whether you’re staying fit or just trying to keep up with your kids, muscle fatigue becomes more noticeable after 40. Nitric oxide helps: By improving circulation and oxygen delivery, NO boosters like Nitric Boost Ultra are perfect for maintaining strength and physical ability well into your 40s, 50s, and beyond. 4. Cognitive Function and Mental Sharpness The gut-brain axis and circulatory function also play a huge role in how you think and feel. As NO supports blood flow to the brain, it can improve: This is particularly helpful for aging men juggling careers, families, and health — NO supplements are a hidden gem in natural cognitive support. 5. Energy and Anti-Aging Effects Fatigue and slowed metabolism are common complaints after 40. By supporting mitochondrial efficiency and cellular energy production, nitric oxide helps: The anti-aging effects of nitric oxide go beyond the surface — they’re about staying functional, vibrant, and energized every single day. Why Nitric Boost Ultra Is Ideal for Men 40+ What makes Nitric Boost Ultra a standout choice for men over 40 is its clean, high-impact formulation: Nitric Oxide Side Effects – What You Should Know Before Taking a NO Booster As nitric oxide supplements like Nitric Boost Ultra continue gaining popularity for blood flow support, workout enhancement, and ED relief, it’s essential to understand the potential side effects and how to use them safely. While most people tolerate nitric oxide boosters well, being informed ensures you can maximize the benefits without unwanted surprises. Are There Any Common Side Effects? Generally, natural nitric oxide supplements are considered safe for healthy adults when taken as directed. However, some individuals may experience mild side effects, particularly when first starting or when taking high doses. Possible side effects may include: These effects are usually temporary and tend to subside as the body adjusts. What Causes These Side Effects? Most side effects stem from the vasodilation process, where blood vessels widen due to increased nitric oxide. This can lead to changes in blood pressure or temporary shifts in circulation. Stimulant-free formulas like Nitric Boost Ultra, which uses natural vasodilators (L-arginine, beetroot, pine bark), are generally easier on the body compared to synthetic or caffeine-loaded options. How to Minimize Risk To enjoy the benefits of nitric oxide safely, follow these guidelines: If you have a pre-existing heart condition or are on blood pressure medications, consult a physician before starting any nitric oxide booster. Who Should Be Cautious? Although NO supplements for men offer amazing benefits, they may not be suitable for: Nitric Boost Ultra is non-GMO, gluten-free, soy-free, and made with clinically backed ingredients, which significantly reduces the risk of allergic reactions or sensitivities. Final Thoughts on Safety Used correctly, nitric oxide supplements are a powerful tool to enhance your performance, health, and energy. With its balanced, stimulant-free formula, Nitric Boost Ultra is designed for daily use without harsh side effects. Still, listening to your body and adjusting as needed is key to a safe and satisfying NO supplement experience. Experience clean, science-backed blood flow support — without the jitters or crashes.

Title: GoDaddy CEO: Focus On Innovation and Customers and The Rest Takes Care of Itself

In a climate of growing scrutiny over digital businesses, GoDaddy Inc. delivered what CEO Aman Bhutani described as “a very strong quarter,” posting results that beat Wall Street forecasts on both the top and bottom line for its first quarter of 2024. Yet, despite the solid quarterly performance and reaffirmed full-year outlook, concerns persist among investors and analysts about the sustainability of GoDaddy’s growth, especially against a backcloth of economic headwinds and wavering consumer sentiment. “We beat across all financial metrics in Q1. So a very strong quarter for us. And we reaffirmed our full-year guidance,” Bhutani told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” in an exclusive interview. “Our customers are resilient. Our business is durable. I’ve never been more excited about being at GoDaddy.” GoDaddy’s financial highlights for the quarter included better-than-expected revenue and earnings per share, supported by ongoing demand for the company’s suite of digital tools enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to establish an online presence. But the company’s shares have come under pressure, sliding in the wake of the report as market participants voiced concerns about underlying trends in customer growth and dependency on price hikes for revenue expansion. Analyst Queries Over Customer Dynamics A number of analysts questioned the optics around declining customer counts and whether increases in average order size or “attach rate”—the number of products per customer—can sustainably drive revenue growth in a competitive and sensitive marketplace. “One analyst has pointed out that the optics are that customer count is coming down. There’s a narrative out there that price drove most of the growth in 2024. And there are questions about whether it’s sustainable this year,” said CNBC host John Fortt. Bhutani responded by shifting the focus from absolute customer numbers to the quality and depth of GoDaddy’s customer relationships. “The idea is to bring high intent customers to GoDaddy, not folks who are looking to buy a cheap domain and then not renew or buy any of our other products,” he said. “We’ve really expanded the product suite over the last few years. We want customers that want to use the breadth of products, and that’s what we’re seeing. We’re seeing increased average order size, improved retention rates, and customers using more of our products.” GoDaddy has been investing in product innovation, including the recent launch of Aero, an AI-powered solution designed to help clients quickly access the full spectrum of GoDaddy’s offerings, from domain registration and website design to e-commerce, digital marketing, and payments. Small Businesses: A Barometer for Economic Mood As a linchpin for millions of small business owners and entrepreneurs, GoDaddy’s performance provides a unique window into the mindset of Main Street businesses—often the first to feel the chill of a softening economy but also the first to rebound when optimism returns. The company conducts regular surveys with its customer base, which Bhutani said gives the company “real-time” insight. “There’s a little bit more tentativeness from our customers on the broader economy. But the core story has not changed, and that story is about our customer being resilient,” Bhutani said. “When we ask them about the economy, yes, they’re a little more concerned, but when we ask them about their business, the majority of them continue to be very bullish about their business.” Industry observers note that GoDaddy operates at a critical juncture for small businesses, many of which rely on the company’s low-cost and essential digital infrastructure. “Our customers need us most for marketing,” Bhutani explained. “A domain name, a website, a little email solution, or just a link to take payments…these are the solutions that are going to be the last things customers give up.” That stickiness, he argued, works in GoDaddy’s favor even in downturns. “Even when a business goes down, a customer doesn’t get rid of their domain name. They’re not giving up the dream,” Bhutani said. “They’re going to keep going and try it again or try something different.” Competitive Positioning Amid Digital Heavyweights Even as GoDaddy faces its usual competition from hosting and web development rivals, broader industry trends are shaping its trajectory. The digital tools segment has been lifted by surging demand for online marketing and commerce solutions; tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google reported robust advertising growth in their latest quarters, reflecting businesses’ increased willingness to optimize digital spending, even amid economic uncertainty. Amazon’s advertising revenue, for instance, rose 90% year-over-year. Asked how GoDaddy fits into this bigger digital transformation, Bhutani outlined an effort to expand beyond core domain registration into “marketing solutions and commerce solutions.” The company’s newest products are designed to capture a greater share of its customers’ digital spending, with lower overall prices and added value for switching or consolidating services. “We’ve got more and more offerings like marketing solutions and commerce solutions as well,” Bhutani said, hinting at a strategy to position GoDaddy not simply as a domain registrar, but as a one-stop digital partner for small businesses. Stock Under Pressure, But Focus Remains on Execution Despite the strategic narrative and the company’s recent investments, GoDaddy stock remains under pressure. Analysts appear unconvinced that product attach and average revenue per user will be enough to drive sustained growth in the event of waning new customer acquisitions—especially in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Bhutani, for his part, remains focused on execution. “My view is let’s focus on the things that we do. Let’s focus on the innovation. Let’s focus on serving our customers. And the rest takes care of itself,” he concluded. He maintains confidence that share price will eventually reflect what the company sees as underlying business strength and resiliency among its core customer base. For now, GoDaddy will be measured less by the hype that once defined the digital domain industry and more by its ability to deepen and lengthen relationships with existing clients—many of whom, in Bhutani’s words, are “not giving up the dream” even in challenging times.
