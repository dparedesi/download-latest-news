Good morning. There’s a lot of debate over last week’s surprise announcement that Netflix struck an $83 billion deal to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery. President Donald Trump said Sunday that their combined market share “could be a problem,” and the deal will face international scrutiny, too. Some takeaways so far: Warner Bros. held out for a bigger shared win. An insider told me that Warner Bros. chief David Zaslav was not eager to partner with Paramount Skydance because of financing, the price, and the fact that rookie CEO David Ellison would not only retain controlling shares but was still digesting his last win. Activate Consulting CEO Michael J. Wolf, a veteran media consultant and former president of MTV Networks, argues that this deal is a must-do for Netflix, given the rising strength of competitors like YouTube, Amazon Prime and Tubi. “No doubt Netflix is the default streaming service,” Wolf told me over the weekend. “Going forward, what will be required to win is more iconic IP and more global franchises that work everywhere. Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the only companies out there that will give Netflix both of these at once.” Experience matters. Content and the ability to distribute it have fueled many an entertainment merger. But history is filled with examples of those who’ve generated huge value for stakeholders from such deals and many that did not. The AOL Time Warner merger proved to be an expensive cautionary tale about clashing cultures, mistimed market shifts and the perils of buying at peak bubble. (Time Warner’s Turner acquisition, on the other hand, was a home run.) I remember GE CEO Jeff Immelt telling me “we know this world” when merging VivendiUniversal and NBC. Turns out GE didn’t create as much value as NBC Universal’s subsequent buyer Comcast did. Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is right to say that “our mission has always been to entertain.” But even if he overcomes antitrust scrutiny, he must then win over Hollywood, investors and consumers who already balk at the idea of this new behemoth. AI is changing the game. We’ve already seen how much AI is changing the entertainment game, with AI-generated actor Tilly Norwood, AI influencers, Coca-Cola commercials, and movies. Since Netflix is a longtime builder—versus a buyer—some wonder if the streamer is interested in Warner Bros.’ deep library for reasons other than simply giving consumers more stuff to consume. As Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told Fortune, the future of entertainment may come down to who owns what she calls “the video corpus” to train and power the next generation of AI models. Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com China’s $1 trillion trade surplus President Trump’s tariffs weren’t enough to rein in China’s exports. The country’s trade surplus blew past $1 trillion for the first time this year, with one month to spare. China’s exports to the U.S. have plummeted, falling 29% in November year-on-year, but shipments to other countries, especially in southeast Asia, have soared, making up the difference. IBM’s big AI deal IBM is reportedly in talks to buy Confluent, a company that manages real-time flow of data in big AI models, in a deal worth $11 billion. The acquisition would be IBM’s largest in recent years; the tech giant announced it was slashing thousands of jobs in November in a shift towards AI. Apple’s C-Suite shakeup Four Apple executives who report to CEO Tim Cook have stepped down in the past week, marking a major shakeup at the tech giant known for C-Suite stability that’s hampering its effort to catch up in the AI race. Deutsche Bank pay bump Deutsche Bank wants to boost the pay of its supervisory board chair, Alexander Wynaendts, who is already the highest-paid chair in Germany’s Dax 40 companies. Germany’s largest lender will ask shareholders to approve a 47% bump for Wynaendts, which will take his pay to roughly $1.6 million. Rate cut expectations Wall Street analysts expect Fed chair Jerome Powell to announce another rate cut following the central bank’s meeting this week but to hold off on signaling a January cut as he balances dovish and hawkish committee members. Bank of America analysts wrote on Friday that Powell will have a hard time sending “a credibly hawkish signal” as important jobs and consumer data will be released between this week’s meeting and the one in January. China’s newest AI billionaire A homegrown Chinese chipmaker, Moore Threads Technology Co., staged China’s second-largest IPO of the year on Friday, raising $1.1 billion. Its stock rocketed 425% in its Shanghai debut, making co-founder Zhang Jianzhong, an ex-Nvidia executive, a billionaire and giving momentum to China’s push for chip self-sufficiency. Moving on from the Metaverse Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is leaving the Metaverse behind as the company announced it is cutting 30% from the budget of the lab responsible for the project, per Bloomberg. The experiment that Zuckerberg once described as the “successor to the mobile internet” has accumulated $70 billion in losses since 2021. S&P 500 futures were up 0.13% this morning. The last session closed up 0.19%. STOXX Europe 600 was flat in early trading. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 was down 0.08% in early trading. Japan’s Nikkei 225 was up 0.18%. China’s CSI 300 was up 0.81%.

Title: The Defining Artworks of 2025

By Francesca Aton, Brian Boucher, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, Emily Watlington December 8, 2025 5:00am By some measures, democracy is in downward decline in quite a few countries across the world, while censorship is only increasing. (A coincidence? Hardly.) But even with so much valid concern about the fragility of the world order more broadly, artists pressed ahead in 2025, producing valuable works that contended with police violence, abuses of power, fallen monuments, climate change, and trans rights. This list taking stock of the 25 artworks that defined the year includes many pieces confronting these issues. Not every work here is a protest, of course; there are also pieces that conjure science-fictional worlds and new possibilities for abstraction. (Not every artwork is even particularly great—we’ve included one piece we really didn’t like but found significant nonetheless.) But in a time when freedom of expression is under threat, just about any kind of art feels political in its own way. This list is a reminder that artists can, and will, forge onward, even in the darkest moments. It’s also a reminder that artists did just that in the past, too. To complement the new and recent artworks featured here, we’ve also roped in some older pieces that speak well to our current mood. These works show that history is unsettled—particularly at a time when some political forces would prefer for the past to remain set in stone. —Alex Greenberger We loved Adrien Brody in The Pianist (2002) and The Brutalist (2024), but “the artist” is a role he is unable to master, judging by the ridiculously bad, overdetermined products on view in his summer show “Made in America,” in which he portrayed iconic characters like Mickey Mouse and Marilyn Monroe, who artists great (Warhol) and not-so-great (KAWS, Banksy) have long since worked with. But the show was seemingly all anyone could talk about. In another great movie, The Matrix (1999), when Joe Pantoliano’s character is going to be plugged back into the fake world, he says, “I want to be rich. Someone important. Like an actor.” But even some actors, with all their money and fame, deep down, just want to be artists. Is that at least something that artists can feel good about? —Brian Boucher As hysteria over AI reached a fever pitch this year, artists began tackling the technology’s implications in refreshingly off-kilter ways. Shanghai-born, Tokyo-based artist Lu Yang is a case in point. Though the artist has been creating videos, installations, and interactive works featuring his virtual avatar Doku since 2020, this year Yang debuted a new installation, DOKU the Creator, that became the talk of Art Basel Hong Kong. (It later traveled in a modified form to the Amant art space in Brooklyn.) The piece is a sensory overload of an installation anchored by an hour-long video in which Doku moves through a surreal dreamscape that blends video game animation with AI-generated imagery. In Hong Kong, the video was presented inside an interactive installation that included a pop-up store. Works were sold in “blind boxes,” each hiding one of 108 possible pieces—a setup that laid bare the casino-like nature of the art market. The video and its surrounding environment evoke an art world in which the artist is no longer essential to the system’s functioning. Doku appears to operate autonomously, free to create, destroy, and mourn the value of art without any mediation by its creator. What distinguishes Yang’s work from other AI critiques is that he seems unbothered by this state of affairs. Drawing on Buddhist philosophy, he suggests that all creation functions like an algorithm—endlessly combining and recombining the totality of human thought and creativity into conceptual forms. Our mistake, he implies, is in attaching too much meaning to the artist, or their originality, at all. In the end, they are all temporary illusions. —Harrison Jacobs Surrealism—which just celebrated its 100th anniversary—is having a moment even as its canon grows ever more inclusive, with rising auction prices for Surrealist works by women, a run of expansive institutional shows like 2022’s “Surrealism Beyond Borders,” and growing interest in formerly underknown figures such as Les Lalanne. A case in point is the Museum of Modern Art’s current Wifredo Lam retrospective, on view through April 11, which presents the Cuban Surrealist painter as a transformative figure rather than an exotic offshoot of a primarily European movement. Of Chinese and African descent, Lam was deliberate about using Afro-Caribbean imagery in his works, famously telling art historian Gerardo Mosquera that his art was “an act of decolonization.” A highlight of MoMA’s exhibition is Lam’s painting Grande Composition (1949), which features a hybrid horse-human taken from the African diasporic religion Santería. The work epitomizes Lam’s belief in what he told Mosquera was “the importance of bringing the Black presence into art.”—Anne Doran Invited to create a work for the Guggenheim’s 1963 Pop Art exhibition “Six Painters and the Object,” artist Harold Stevenson produced The New Adam, a 40-foot-long wraparound painting of a nude man. (Actor Sal Mineo was the model for the body; the partially obscured face is that of Stevenson’s lover at the time, British aristocrat Timothy Willoughby.) It was rejected by the show’s curator Lawrence Alloway, who wrote, “[The] problem . . . is publicity, rumor, and all those entertaining things which would go along with exhibiting a nude with a phallus the size of a man.” More than 60 years later the time finally seems right for Stevenson’s gargantuan canvas, which not only celebrates the male body but expresses homosexual desire at a scale impossible to ignore. It is currently on view through January 19 in the Whitney Museum of American Art’s exhibition “Sixties Surreal.” —Anne Doran Few works in 2025 carried the cultural and political weight of Un coro de yicas (A chorus of yicas), the centerpiece of Claudia Alarcón and Silät’s exhibition at James Cohan. The installation—composed of 100 hand-woven yica bags—made visible a lineage of Wichí women whose textile knowledge has been passed down by generations and until recently dismissed as craft. Each yica is made using chaguar fibers harvested, processed, spun, dyed, and woven through a communal, intergenerational labor system that Alarcón learned at age 12. The work crystallizes what their practice represents: not formalist abstraction but a living language, a structure of communication, memory, and autonomy passed from mothers to daughters across the Alto la Sierra and La Puntana communities in Argentina. Seen together, the 100 bags operate as both archive and chorus, a collective declaration of presence at a moment when Indigenous women’s labor is finally being recognized as contemporary art. —Daniel Cassady This mixed-media sculpture by Ser Serpas featured in the MoMA PS1 exhibition “The Gatherers,” which brought together the work of artists whose practices collect and accumulate various forms of detritus in a world that is increasingly wasteful and on the brink of environmental collapse. Serpas is one such young artist who has injected new energy into this form of assemblage. Her installation, titled tube of brief cadavers made sadder still, might on its surface resemble a trash heap at a dump, but the two main items juxtaposed together—a plastic orange saddle-like contraption that could be part of a boat, and shredded silver fabric recalling emergency blankets—lend the piece a connotation of migrants fleeing by sea. Its haunting title seems to confirm that allusion, memorializing those who do not make the crossing and, more recently, those who are being targeted in such boats. —Maximilíano Durón The history of Japanese internment—when the United States government detained and imprisoned its own citizens—never seems to loom as large within American consciousness as it should. Perhaps that might change with Bruce Yonemoto’s Broken Fences, which debuted in the Hammer Museum’s “Made in L.A.” biennial this year, where it emerged as one of the show’s standouts. For the piece, Yonemoto has constructed two fence-like armatures into which he has embedded video screens. On the screens play two sets of propaganda—sometimes side by side, sometimes separately: one produced by the U.S. War Relocation Authority documenting the deportation of Japanese Americans, and one created by the Nazis about the Theresienstadt concentration camp. Both falsely promote the supposed “benefits” of these detentions. (The work’s dominating audio, however, comes from the German propaganda film.) Yonemoto poignantly underscores how two opposing wartime powers deployed strikingly similar visual and rhetorical tools, drawing a chilling parallel between their methods and the ideologies they served.—Maximilíano Durón More so than any other artist this year, South Korean phenom Ayoung Kim took the American art press by storm, with her work appearing on the cover of simultaneous issues of Artforum and Frieze this fall. (ARTnews also profiled her around that time, too.) There’s good reason to be suspicious of any artist who receives so much attention so suddenly, but Kim is the real deal, as proven by her current MoMA PS1 exhibition and a Performa commission staged this past November. The centerpiece of her PS1 show is this video installation, one of three chapters in a trilogy of works about motorcycle-riding female delivery workers who seem to attract and antagonize each other. Projected onto three formidably sized screens that hang from the ceiling, Kim’s footage switches seamlessly between imagery made using gaming engines and AI, and often displays impossibly tall ramps and staircases in futuristic worlds. Those worlds may not look ours, but the workers who scale them are navigating a capitalistic rat race that feels a lot like the one of the present. —Alex Greenberger The mercurial pop-music star Lorde tapped the art world in a number of ways in the promotional push around her fourth studio album Virgin, including a video that alluded to Walter De Maria’s seminal Land art work The New York Earth Room and, in a booklet that accompanied the vinyl LP, a bare-it-all picture of a waist in see-through pants by photographer Talia Chetrit. But the cover of the album was the master stroke: an X-ray image of a pelvis by Heji Shin. Bones in the arresting image are joined by a zipper (the same one as in the pants in Chetrit’s photo?) and an IUD. —Andy Battaglia This one’s very meta. When climate protestors threw soup on Van Gogh’s sunflowers and mashed potatoes on Monet’s haystacks, their detractors decried defacing any art. Never mind that all their targets were protected with plexiglas, a veneer made from fossil fuels poetically shielding these human-produced views of nature, which apparently seemed more precious to some than nature itself. Beyond the ragebait headlines, the boring moralist should-they-or-shouldn’t-theys, the protestors’ gesture blurred protest and art in more ways than one. A series by Goldin+Senneby honors the Just Stop Oil group’s conceptual heft while turning cries of conservation on their head. Working with professional conservators, the duo meticulously recreated each splattered plexi vitrine to scale, showing them against blank walls and turning them into paintings themselves. You can bask in their irreverent glory at the MIT List Visual Arts Center, where I first saw them, through mid-March. —Emily Watlington This is a game: Move your mouse across a digital landscape, select your drone’s target, press “X” for death. In Domestic Tension, Iraqi American artist Wafaa Bilal argues that this is the numbing ease of modern warfare—where the distance between people and their would-be killers has been so thoroughly abstracted that devastation can be delivered from an office chair. The piece stands as an example of what Bilal has called a “networked performance.” He confined himself to a Chicago gallery for its duration, broadcasting live online 24/7 and inviting viewers to chat, observe, or—if they were so mysteriously compelled—shoot him with a robotically-controlled paintball gun. (Non-lethal bullets still hurt.) Domestic Tension simulated the unending anxiety faced by Iraqis worldwide, forced to anticipate violence—whether physical, like a US-made bomb, or existential, as the so-called War on Terror legitimized racism: it’s acceptable to fire, so long as the target is Arab. —Tessa Solomon On most days, David Zwirner’s townhouse on New York’s Upper East Side functions well as a domestic space converted into white-cube gallery, but during the run of P. Staff’s remarkable show there this fall, the building’s spiral staircase was occasionally drenched in a haunting shades of blue. The source of that emanation was Penetration, a video projected across all three of the gallery’s floors, in which a figure stands stoically in a darkened space. A laser beam shoots through the void, aimed directly at this person’s stomach. What did that mean? Never one to let viewers off the hook easily, Staff did not offer many clues, though those familiar with the artist’s past work might recognize in this video a statement on the surveillance of bodies that do not conform to conservative gender norms. That kind of violence is endemic right now in the US—the Trump administration recently announced a measure that would keep trans Americans from changing their gender on their passports—but Staff notably did not explicitly portray it. Sometimes, everyday life is scary enough. —Alex Greenberger The trend of women painting women and calling it “feminist” has been brewing for some time, but it exploded this autumn in what I dubbed “feminist figuration fall.” Yet there is a clear divide between work trafficking in—and profiting from—pastiche and normative fantasy, and those building new, feminist worlds. Amid it all, Gordon’s show at David Zwirner stood out. In this particular painting, luminous skin glows eerily green and is punctuated with cellulite and stretch marks. Meanwhile, each of our subject’s long hairs are rendered individually. Gordon stands naked in this self-portrait save for a pair of black kitten heels, not just echoing Manet’s Olympia but talking back to it. The work both repels and allures at the same time, drawing you in, then challenging all your first impressions. She’s not relying on normative ideas of beauty as a crutch so much as reimagining what beauty might be. —Emily Watlington The difficulty of trying to remember all the little details in Laura Owens’s brain-bending painting/installation/show at Matthew Marks Gallery rhymes with the way that those details were hard to discern even when in their presence, in real time. The artist’s brush had bristled and stroked different dimensions, making for trompe l’oeil effects that twisted into spirals while turning inside-out and back again. Here too were traces of “painting” (as well as sly admonitions of it), as evident on the walls as they were on canvases that almost seemed to play a supporting role. Moving through the hidden door connecting the show’s two main spaces—each adorned with paintings of wallpaper and inexplicable things like pretzels floating in the air, and one with tiny mechanical panels that opened to reveal still more painting inside—gave rise to the most thrilling idea of an “art gallery” rather than the too-often humdrum reality of one. —Andy Battaglia This piece is a monumental act of witnessing: a 23-hour video drawn entirely from footage of U.S. State Department press briefings spanning October 2023 to January 2025, the end of the Biden administration. What begins with a journalist politely stating “I have a couple of questions” becomes an epic portrait of governmental irresponsibility as reporters—bleary, persistent, increasingly furious—try and fail to obtain clarity on Israel, Palestine, and the United States’s role therein. By editing out the spokesmen’s evasive, nothingburger replies, with cuts at times turning officials’ remarks into syllable salads, Reynolds and Ochshorn leave only the questions, revealing the briefings as a looping theater of deflection. It’s a horror film without the jump cuts: we watch the State Department rebrand its atrocities through the art of PR, confident in its own immunity. Presented without commentary, the footage indicts by showing instead of telling: this system will neither acknowledge its hypocrisies nor confront the human cost of its policies. As the genocide escalates and trust erodes, the journalists’ inquiries move from specific facts toward procedural and ethical pleas—“How do you know?” “Is there any plan?”—questions that echo far beyond the room. The film stands as one of the year’s most urgent artworks, a stark record of accountability sought and systematically denied. —Emily Watlington The beginning of the year saw Los Angeles hit by devastating wildfires, including the Eaton Fire, which decimated parts of Altadena, an unincorporated part of Los Angeles County that for generations has been home to a thriving home of Black creativity. In response, Kenturah Davis created an embossed editioned print that featured a vintage map of Altadena onto which she had rubbed pigment that incorporated soil from outside her home, which burned in the fires. Altadena featured in an exhibition mounted by the California African American Museum just months after the wildfires to reflect on the immense loss and featured three generations of the Davis family. A work like Davis’s is a testament to the community’s resilience: from the ashes, a new Altadena will rise. —Maximilíano Durón How does one represent Palestine? It’s a question that has plagued artists and writers throughout the last century, as even the most seemingly anondyne depictions can’t help but become freighted with meaning and political valence—a tendency that has only grown since October 7 and Israel’s war in Gaza. In a work commissioned for the Taipei Biennial, Omar Mismar lands on a towering sculpture of flowers. The work is suffused with an unending grief, with the flowers evoking the ones placed typically at a tombstone. But Mismar is after something more complicated: the flowers are artificial, made out of fabric and modeled after illustrations found in Flowers of Palestine (1870), a book by Swiss missionary Hanna Zeller. Here, Mismar tackles a contradiction inherent in the idea of Palestine: some of the most detailed preservations of the land and culture were those created from a colonial gaze. The flowers do not wilt or smell. They are forever perfect, if inert. But read another way, Palestine remains an idea that will not wilt or die, due in no small part to the grief it inspires. —Harrison Jacobs More often than not—and often for the worse—US history is a work of fiction at the mercy of its makers. This provocation animates Stan Douglas’s five-channel film installation, Birth of a Nation (2025), which reframes one of cinema’s most insidious legacies of white supremacy: the 110-year-old Klan rallying cry that shares its name. For it, Douglas, a keen reader of the messages smuggled into our media, constructed an alternative narrative to a pivotal 13-minute section of D. W. Griffith’s original film, in which a Black soldier named Gus pursues a young white woman to the edge of a cliff. Though this is a tragic case of misidentification, the woman ultimately leaps to her death to escape his designs, a moment intended by the film to obliterate any sympathies that still stood for formerly enslaved Black Americans at the height of Jim Crow; the soldier—played by a white actor in blackface—is later lynched. While this scene loops on one screen, the other four present alternate outcomes of the same sequence of events made possible by new perspectives included in Douglas’s script. The characters are released from their crude casts of “villain,” “damsel,” and “hero,” and open the possibility that viewers, too, might question how they’ve looked away from a clearer, more complex picture of the powers shaping our prejudices. —Tessa Solomon Sometimes, an artwork gains new importance for reasons that are less than fortunate, and that was the case when Thomas J. Price’s Grounded in the Stars visited Times Square over the summer. The piece had already appeared elsewhere, generating little controversy in the process, but when Grounded in the Stars came to New York, the sculpture suddenly gained the attention of conservative reactionaries, who mocked Price’s piece online, remaking it in racist memes and as AI slop. What, exactly, was so offensive about a 12-foot-tall statue of a Black woman standing around? Most of the sculpture’s detractors seemed to deflect the question in social media tirades and op-eds, though it was clear that a larger debate about monuments—who deserves to be represented with them, and who they are for—hung in the background. With Trump now calling for the reinstatement of monuments that were “removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history” in 2020 or afterward, pieces like Grounded in the Stars suddenly seem even more essential. —Alex Greenberger More than a decade after Pussy Riot cofounder Nadya Tolokonnikova was incarcerated in Russia, the artist returned to a prison of her own making in her performance installation Police State (2025) at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles this June. Tolokonnikova reimagined her prison cell as a space for art—a form of reclamation not only for herself but also for the Russian, Belarusian, and American prisoners whose pieces were incorporated into the installation. Inside, visitors could observe Tolokonnikova making music or art, or even resting throughout the day, via security camera footage and peepholes. The eerie authoritarian state came to life extended beyond MOCA, however, when anti-ICE protests erupted and the National Guard was deployed. With Police State unexpectedly closed to the public during the protests, Tolokonnikova continued staging the work in private, underscoring the piece’s continued relevance amid the ongoing political conflicts in the US and abroad. —Francesca Aton You can basically count on art by being censored for obscenity and support of matters like the Palestinian cause. But how can a simple flag cause trouble? That’s at the heart of the mystery behind Replacement by Cameron Rowland. Shown at the Palais de Tokyo as part of the show “Echo Delay Reverb,” the piece consisted simply of the flag of Martinique, an overseas department of France, flown above the Paris institution where a French flag is typically hung. Martinicans have fought for freedom from French rule for centuries, the artist pointed out in an accompanying text, and the flag replaced the customary French one. Within a day, the Palais de Tokyo removed the work, posting a text noting that the piece may be “considered illegal.” How? No one has elaborated. Score one for the power of the most minimal artistic gestures to cause a ruckus. —Brian Boucher In 2016, Jade Guanaro Kuriki-Olivo staged a performance called Liberté, in which performers of various gender identities dressed as the Statue of Liberty, turning a common New York tourist attraction into a kind of drag show. Nine years and two Trump administrations later, Kuriki-Olivo created a sequel in the form of Liberté Morte (Dead Liberty), a sculpture in which a Statue of Liberty costume is splayed out on a plinth. It was a a darker, more sinister approach that responded to the increased marginalization of trans people in the US between Trump administrations, and it suggested that freedom—a fragile notion right now—may be as good as dead in America. —Francesca Aton Trans Forming Liberty (2024), a painting depicting the Black trans-femme model and performance artist Arewà Basit carrying a torch à la the Statue of Liberty, made its debut last year at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in Amy Sherald’s survey “American Sublime.” It didn’t cause controversy there or at the Whitney Museum, where the exhibition went next. But before the show traveled to the Smithsonian-run National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C., the museum reportedly tried to remove the painting, leading Sherald to cancel the exhibition and allege censorship. Instead of shying away, Sherald told the New Yorker that the work “demands a fuller vision of freedom, one that includes the dignity of all bodies, all identities. Liberty isn’t fixed. She transforms, and so must we.” The painting thus became a symbol of protest—and even served as the cover for the August 11 issue of the New Yorker. —Francesca Aton The notion that history repeats itself is both a cliché and a truth, and it is one that Barbara Kruger has always considered in her work, which often finds her remaking the same textual statements about power using the same signature font, just in different settings. Featuring such phrases as “WHO IS BEYOND THE LAW?,” Untitled (Questions) ended up proving Kruger’s point when it figured so prominently in the background of the anti-ICE protests that roiled Los Angeles over the summer. Pictures of the National Guard standing beneath Kruger’s mural, sited at the Geffen Contemporary venue of the Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles, seemed to answer the artist’s questions well enough, so it was hardly a shock when the photographs went viral. What was more surprising was just how closely those pictures mirrored ones taken in the same place in 1992, when the National Guard was deployed to LA to quell demonstrations following Rodney King’s beating by members of the Los Angeles Police Department. In 2018, Kruger said of Untitled (Questions), “It’s both tragic and disappointing that this work, 30 years later, might still have some resonance.” Seven years on, it remains both tragic and disappointing that Kruger is always right. —Alex Greenberger There’s something familiar yet uncanny about Kara Walker’s Unmanned Drone, which this year served as the focal point of The Brick’s portion of the “Monuments” exhibition. For this towering sculpture, Walker dissected and dismembered a decommissioned statue of Stonewall Jackson atop his horse, Little Sorrel, that once stood outside a courthouse in Charlottesville, Virginia. The original, unveiled in 1921 and made by Charles Keck, stood 13 feet high and 16 feet long. Walker’s version is just as monumental but deliberately fragmented, deconstructing the myth built around Jackson in the decades following the Civil War to prop up the falsehoods of the Lost Cause—namely, that had Jackson not met an untimely death, the Confederacy would have won. By taking apart the statue and soldering it back together so that Jackson’s and Sorrel’s body parts merge in confounding, often grotesque ways, Walker lays bare the mechanics of myth-making. She shows how the building blocks of racist historical narratives can appear too large to dismantle but, in fact, can be slowly unraveled to expose the lies beneath.—Maximilíano Durón The World's Premier Art Magazine since 1913.

Google and Amazon are aggressively developing their own AI chips (TPUs, Trainium3) to reduce reliance on Nvidia, signaling a shift toward self-reliance in AI hardware. Despite a 2.5% stock dip due to Google's potential TPU deal with Meta, Nvidia maintains confidence in its generational lead, with Blackwell/Rubin chips sold out through 2026. Hyperscalers' ASICs offer cost efficiency for specific workloads, but Nvidia's GPUs and CUDA ecosystem remain unmatched for versatility across industries (AI, gaming, robotics, etc.). U.S.-China tech wars and export restrictions push China (via Huawei) to develop domestic alternatives, but Nvidia's short-term dominance persists as the AI chip market rapidly expands. While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition.

While hyperscalers carve out niches, Nvidia's entrenched infrastructure (NVLink, software) ensures ongoing relevanceâbut long-term leadership depends on innovation amid rising competition. The AI revolution is reshaping the tech landscape at breakneck speed, and nowhere is this more evident than in the semiconductor industry. Nvidia has long been the undisputed leader in AI hardware, powering everything from cloud computing to autonomous vehicles with its cutting-edge GPUs. But recent developments suggest that Big Tech giantsâparticularly Google and Amazonâare making aggressive moves to reduce their reliance on Nvidia by developing and even selling their own AI chips. The latest shockwave came with reports that Google could soon sell its custom Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) to Meta in a deal potentially worth billions. This sent Nvidia's stock tumbling 2.5% in a single day, signaling investor concerns that one of Nvidia's biggest customers might soon become a competitor. Meanwhile, Amazon unveiled its Trainium3 chip, boasting a 50% cost reduction in AI training compared to alternatives. While Nvidia remains confidentâclaiming its technology is still a generation aheadâthe question looms: Is the AI chip market shifting beneath Nvidia's feet? Google and Amazon aren't just buying Nvidia's GPUsâthey're designing their own specialized AI processors known as ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits). Unlike Nvidia's general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are optimized for specific workloads, making them highly efficient for certain AI tasks. "Google knows their requirements and can optimize their chips accordingly," says Forrester senior analyst Alvin Nguyen. "That doesn't mean their TPUs are superior to Nvidia in every way, but for Google's needs, they can outperform." Amazon's Trainium3 follows a similar logicâtailored for AI training workloads, it promises significant cost savings. But ASICs come with limitations. If a company's AI models evolve, their custom chips may need redesigningâa costly and time-consuming process. That's why hyperscalers like Google and Amazon still buy Nvidia GPUs as a hedge against shifting AI demands. Nvidia's unmatched flexibility Nvidia's strength lies in its versatility. Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram." Additionally, Nvidia isn't just selling GPUsâit's expanding into networking with NVLink and AI infrastructure solutions. Amazon, despite pushing Trainium3, still relies on Nvidia's NVLink for its servers. This symbiotic relationship means that even as Big Tech builds its own chips, Nvidia remains indispensable. Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions. As Washington restricts AI chip exports to Beijing, China is scrambling to develop domestic alternatives. Huawei's Ascend chips pose a long-term threat, but for now, China remains dependent on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Big Tech's push for self-reliance reflects a broader trend: AI is too critical to outsource entirely. Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players.

Its GPUs aren't just AI acceleratorsâthey power gaming, robotics, autonomous vehicles and scientific computing. Moreover, Nvidia's CUDA software ecosystem is deeply entrenched in AI development, making its hardware the default choice for many developers. "Nvidia's architecture is transferable across industries," explains Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. "If your model changes, you don't need a new chipâyou just reprogram." Additionally, Nvidia isn't just selling GPUsâit's expanding into networking with NVLink and AI infrastructure solutions. Amazon, despite pushing Trainium3, still relies on Nvidia's NVLink for its servers. This symbiotic relationship means that even as Big Tech builds its own chips, Nvidia remains indispensable. Hyperscalers like Google, Amazon and Microsoft account for roughly 50% of Nvidia's data center revenue. If they shift more workloads to in-house chips, could Nvidia's growth stall? Not necessarily. "The AI chip market is expanding so fast that there's room for multiple players," says Rasgon. While Google and Amazon may carve out niches, Nvidia's Blackwell and Rubin AI chips are already sold out through 2026, with projected revenues nearing $500 billion. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh sums it up: "Nvidia is still the king." But in the rapidly evolving AI arms race, even kings must adaptâor risk being dethroned. The bigger picture: geopolitics and AI dominance This chip rivalry isn't just about corporate competitionâit's intertwined with U.S.-China tensions. As Washington restricts AI chip exports to Beijing, China is scrambling to develop domestic alternatives. Huawei's Ascend chips pose a long-term threat, but for now, China remains dependent on Nvidia. Meanwhile, Big Tech's push for self-reliance reflects a broader trend: AI is too critical to outsource entirely. Whether Nvidia can maintain its lead hinges on its ability to stay ahead in both hardware and softwareâwhile fending off rivals who once were its biggest customers. One thing is certain: The AI chip wars are just heating up. According to BrightU.AI's Enoch,Â Google and Amazon entering the AI chip arena will intensify competition, leveraging their vast resources and cloud infrastructure to challenge Nvidia's dominance. However, Nvidia's established ecosystem, CUDA platform and first-mover advantage in AI acceleration make it resilientâthough not invincibleâas the market fragments with new players.

A series of exits and impending departures across top management and engineering ranks in recent weeks has raised fresh questions about the stability of the company’s leadership bench — and the readiness of the world’s most valuable firm to accelerate its artificial-intelligence (AI) push. A Yahoo Finance report said that while a quick succession of exits usually signifies a sinking boat, there could be more to this situation. The churn comes at a moment of financial strength: Apple has posted strong quarterly results powered by new iPhone sales, its market value has climbed past $4 trillion, and the stock is trading near record highs. The issue, the report said, isn’t performance—it’s who is leaving, and from which parts of the organization. According to the report, Apple has been under mounting pressure to deliver on AI, a space where critics argue it has fallen behind despite the technology’s transformative potential. Many of the executives now exiting were tied to AI product integration, hardware strategy or design — the very areas Apple needs to lean on as it tries to close the gap. Besides this, CEO Tim Cook is nearing retirement age, and there is big speculation over who will, or can, take over after front-runner Jeff Williams left. Notably, Apple has not explicitly said that the executive changes are AI development-based, but most of those on their way out have been closely associated with its AI product integration or design aspects. Deepwater Asset Management managing partner and longtime Apple watcher Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance, “I think that the changes that have happened are largely because Cook wants to shake things up. And instead of being a follower in AI, he wants to be a leader. So, I think it's more than just a typical transition. I think ... this is a big deal.” A veteran engineer who joined in 2018, with prior experience at Microsoft and Google, Giannandrea's departure was viewed as a strategic move, as Apple continued to lag behind competitors in the AI space, as per various reports. Now filling the role is researcher Amar Subramanya, who moved from corporate Vice President of AI at Microsoft, before which he spent 16 years heading engineering for Google's Gemini digital assistant. He will report to Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi. Announcing his appointment, Apple cited Subramanya's experience integrating AI into features and products as “important to Apple's ongoing innovation and future Apple Intelligence features”, AFP reported. Commenting on Subramanya's appointment in the company release, Apple CEO Tim Cook said AI is “central to Apple's strategy” and that the new chief will bring “extraordinary AI expertise” to the role. Alan Dye, meanwhile, was involved in the Apple Vision Pro launch and helped with “integrating eye/hand interactions and immersion”. In 2025, he led the design of Liquid Glass and helped unify the design language for iOS, iPadOS, MacOS, watchOS and tvOS. ZK Research founder and principal analyst Zeus Kerravala told Yahoo Finance, “There is a renewed push by Apple to accelerate its AI roadmap, especially after criticism that its earlier AI efforts with Siri ... lagged behind a lot of the rivals. I think what makes Apple kind of unique is they can be behind [in] technology because of the fandom that's around Apple and the ecosystem that they lock people into. I think, from an Apple perspective right now, it's ‘make these changes now, and make sure you are positioned well,’ or you are going to start losing share, eventually.” (With inputs from Agencies) Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. In this section of the November 2025 episode of FO° Exclusive, Atul Singh and Glenn Carle examine growing fears that the US stock market has become detached from economic reality. Inequality, weakening consumer demand and policy time lags now increase systemic risk. Mounting fiscal strain, tariff uncertainty and global diversification away from the dollar make a significant market correction increasingly plausible. This article saved into your bookmarks. Click here to view your bookmarks. Editor-in-Chief Atul Singh and FOI Senior Partner Glenn Carle, a retired CIA officer who now advises companies, governments and organizations on geopolitical risk, discuss rising fears of a US stock market bubble, with particular attention to technology and artificial intelligence. Their concern is not simply that equities are expensive, but that today’s valuations reflect expectations the real economy may be unable to meet. Drawing on warnings by market experts, fiscal data and consumer indicators, they argue that the American economy is showing strains beneath the surface while markets continue to price in near-perfect economic conditions. The gap between financial optimism and economic reality, they suggest, is widening dangerously. The AI boom and extreme market concentration Atul opens by highlighting warnings from Albert Edwards, the global strategist at French bank Société Générale, who sees the US equity market — especially tech and AI stocks — in the midst of a classic bubble. Some major technology firms are trading at roughly 30 times forward earnings, a level Atul calls “a ridiculous figure.” These valuations, Edwards argues, leave little margin for error. The discussion stresses that such optimism depends on extraordinary assumptions. Citing estimates from JPMorgan Chase, Atul notes that for companies to earn a 10% return on projected AI capital expenditure by 2030, they would collectively need around $650 billion in annual AI revenues — roughly $400 per year from every iPhone user. While some fund managers remain bullish, arguing AI-led productivity gains justify this optimism, many investors view the revenue assumptions as implausible. Market gains are also highly concentrated. Roughly 60% of recent stock market growth has come from just seven firms: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. The remaining 40% of the market is up as well, but far less dramatically. This concentration amplifies systemic risk, as any correction among a handful of firms could reverberate across the entire market. Inequality, consumers and the fragile base of demand The US economy ultimately depends on consumer demand, even if that reality is often obscured by soaring asset prices. Glenn underlines that consumption today is increasingly driven by the wealthy. Around 80–86% of the gains from recent tax cuts have flowed to the top 1% of Americans, while the bottom 80% have seen little or no growth in disposable income for years. This imbalance matters because wealthy households cannot replace mass demand. Glenn sums it up starkly: “1,000 billionaires cannot buy as many cars as 100 million lower-middle-class Americans.” If middle- and lower-middle-class consumers cannot afford homes, cars or basic goods, economic momentum weakens regardless of stock prices. Atul turns the conversation to the declining role of entrepreneurs. Building small, innovative firms has become much more difficult as large corporations dominate markets. Historically, smaller companies have driven job creation and experimentation in both the US and Europe. Their erosion, Glenn adds, pushes the economy toward oligopoly — less competition, weaker innovation and slower long-term growth. Time lags, tariffs and mounting economic strain A central theme of the discussion is what Glenn calls the “lag factor” in economic policy. Despite commentators’ claims that new tariffs have had little immediate impact, policy effects take time. Even small changes in short-term interest rates can take around six months to affect the economy, while longer-term rates and fiscal measures often take 18 months or more. Dismissing these delays may prove dangerous. Although tariff revenues have risen and trade flows have not collapsed, uncertainty itself is already affecting behavior. CEOs faced with shifting rules and arbitrary implementation hesitate to make long-term investment decisions. Supporters inside the Trump administration counter by likening the US market to a Disneyland theme park, arguing that trading partners will continue to accept lower margins because there is no substitute — a view closely associated with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who administration insiders credit with engineering a delicate balancing act between trade pressure and market stability. Supporters also point to the US–China trade deal, which they argue removed Chinese export controls on rare earths, halted retaliation against US semiconductor firms and reopened Chinese markets to American agricultural exports. Critics respond that this confidence underestimates how quickly countries adapt when costs rise. Glenn points to rising housing costs, weak youth employment, a growing deficit and slowing construction as indicators of a slowdown in the economy. Atul reinforces this view with insider insights from within Washington, DC. Sources in the US Treasury worry not just about tariffs, but about affordability, cost-of-living pressures and weakening demand. Meanwhile, headline fiscal numbers are troubling. US debt is projected to exceed that of Italy and Greece for the first time this century, while the budget deficit remains near 6% in peacetime. Demand, dislocation and a possible crash Beyond near-term indicators, Atul and Glenn raise a deeper structural concern: demand in an AI-driven economy. Even if AI significantly boosts production and efficiency, it may also displace jobs faster than new ones emerge. Atul likens the situation to the late 1920s, when productivity surged, but demand failed to keep pace, ending in a market collapse. Signs of stress are already showing. University of Michigan consumer confidence fell to 50.3 in November, the second-worst reading ever recorded — worse than during the 2008 global financial crisis or the 2020 Covid-19 downturn. Household balance sheets are also deteriorating: roughly 4.5% of US household debt is now delinquent, while student-loan delinquencies have reached record levels. Youth unemployment has climbed above 8%, and job-search times are lengthening. Simultaneously, while the dollar remains the world’s main trading currency, it is declining as a store of value. Central banks and investors are diversifying away from the mighty greenback. Even allies like Canada are actively seeking to reduce reliance on the US market through shifting trade, tourism and even defense procurement decisions. Importantly, rising market volatility presents a major risk, with the Cboe Volatility Index crossing the 20 mark, signaling higher-than-normal expected market volatility and increased investor uncertainty or fear Investors and economists are increasingly talking of an impending crash. These predictions might be a bit too pessimistic, but dismissing them would be reckless. As Atul puts it, “just because there’s a lot of talk about it doesn’t mean that it is all talk.” Together, the indicators paint a consistent picture: an irrational exuberance in markets, an economy under increasing strains and a growing risk that economic realities upend ebullient markets.

Title: The Reverse-Centaur's Guide to Criticizing AI

Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow No trackers, no ads. Black type, white background. Privacy policy: we don't collect or retain any data at all ever period. Last night, I gave a speech for the University of Washington's "Neuroscience, AI and Society" lecture series, through the university's Computational Neuroscience Center. It was called "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI," and it's based on the manuscript for my next book, "The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Life After AI," which will be out from Farrar, Straus and Giroux next June: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/future-tense-neuroscience-ai-and-society-with-cory-doctorow-tickets-1735371255139 The talk was sold out, but here's the text of my lecture. I'm very grateful to UW for the opportunity, and for a lovely visit to Seattle! == I'm a science fiction writer, which means that my job is to make up futuristic parables about our current techno-social arrangements to interrogate not just what a gadget does, but who it does it for, and who it does it to. What I don't do is predict the future. No one can predict the future, which is a good thing, since if the future were predictable, that would mean that what we all do couldn't change it. It would mean that the future was arriving on fixed rails and couldn't be steered. Jesus Christ, what a miserable proposition! Now, not everyone understands the distinction. They think sf writers are oracles, soothsayers. Unfortunately, even some of my colleagues labor under the delusion that they can "see the future." But for every sf writer who deludes themselves into thinking that they are writing the future, there are a hundred sf fans who believe that they are reading the future, and a depressing number of those people appear to have become AI bros. The fact that these guys can't shut up about the day that their spicy autocomplete machine will wake up and turn us all into paperclips has led many confused journalists and conference organizers to try to get me to comment on the future of AI. That's a thing I strenuously resisted doing, because I wasted two years of my life explaining patiently and repeatedly why I thought crypto was stupid, and getting relentless bollocked by cryptocurrency cultists who at first insisted that I just didn't understand crypto. And then, when I made it clear that I did understand crypto, insisted that I must be a paid shill. This is literally what happens when you argue with Scientologists, and life is Just. Too. Short. So I didn't want to get lured into another one of those quagmires, because on the one hand, I just don't think AI is that important of a technology, and on the other hand, I have very nuanced and complicated views about what's wrong, and not wrong, about AI, and it takes a long time to explain that stuff. But people wouldn't stop asking, so I did what I always do. I wrote a book. Over the summer I wrote a book about what I think about AI, which is really about what I think about AI criticism, and more specifically, how to be a good AI critic. By which I mean: "How to be a critic whose criticism inflicts maximum damage on the parts of AI that are doing the most harm." I titled the book The Reverse Centaur's Guide to Life After AI, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux will publish it in June, 2026. But you don't have to wait until then because I am going to break down the entire book's thesis for you tonight, over the next 40 minutes. I am going to talk fast. # Start with what a reverse centaur is. In automation theory, a "centaur" is a person who is assisted by a machine. You're a human head being carried around on a tireless robot body. Driving a car makes you a centaur, and so does using autocomplete. And obviously, a reverse centaur is machine head on a human body, a person who is serving as a squishy meat appendage for an uncaring machine. Like an Amazon delivery driver, who sits in a cabin surrounded by AI cameras, that monitor the driver's eyes and take points off if the driver looks in a proscribed direction, and monitors the driver's mouth because singing isn't allowed on the job, and rats the driver out to the boss if they don't make quota. The driver is in that van because the van can't drive itself and can't get a parcel from the curb to your porch. The driver is a peripheral for a van, and the van drives the driver, at superhuman speed, demanding superhuman endurance. But the driver is human, so the van doesn't just use the driver. The van uses the driver up. Obviously, it's nice to be a centaur, and it's horrible to be a reverse centaur. There are lots of AI tools that are potentially very centaur-like, but my thesis is that these tools are created and funded for the express purpose of creating reverse-centaurs, which is something none of us want to be. But like I said, the job of an sf writer is to do more than think about what the gadget does, and drill down on who the gadget does it for and who the gadget does it to. Tech bosses want us to believe that there is only one way a technology can be used. Mark Zuckerberg wants you to think that it's technologically impossible to have a conversation with a friend without him listening in. Tim Cook wants you to think that it's technologically impossible for you to have a reliable computing experience unless he gets a veto over which software you install and without him taking 30 cents out of every dollar you spend. Sundar Pichai wants you think that it's impossible for you to find a webpage unless he gets to spy on you from asshole to appetite. This is all a kind of vulgar Thatcherism. Margaret Thatcher's mantra was "There is no alternative." She repeated this so often they called her "TINA" Thatcher: There. Is. No. Alternative. TINA. "There is no alternative" is a cheap rhetorical slight. It's a demand dressed up as an observation. "There is no alternative" means "STOP TRYING TO THINK OF AN ALTERNATIVE." Which, you know, fuck that. I'm an sf writer, my job is to think of a dozen alternatives before breakfast. So let me explain what I think is going on here with this AI bubble, and sort out the bullshit from the material reality, and explain how I think we could and should all be better AI critics. # Start with monopolies: tech companies are gigantic and they don't compete, they just take over whole sectors, either on their own or in cartels. Google and Meta control the ad market. Google and Apple control the mobile market, and Google pays Apple more than $20 billion/year not to make a competing search engine, and of course, Google has a 90% Search market-share. Now, you'd think that this was good news for the tech companies, owning their whole sector. But it's actually a crisis. You see, when a company is growing, it is a "growth stock," and investors really like growth stocks. When you buy a share in a growth stock, you're making a bet that it will continue to grow. So growth stocks trade at a huge multiple of their earnings. This is called the "price to earnings ratio" or "P/E ratio." But once a company stops growing, it is a "mature" stock, and it trades at a much lower P/E ratio. So for every dollar that Target – a mature company – brings in, it is worth ten dollars. It has a P/E ratio of 10, while Amazon has a P/E ratio of 36, which means that for every dollar Amazon brings in, the market values it at $36. It's wonderful to run a company that's got a growth stock. Your shares are as good as money. If you want to buy another company, or hire a key worker, you can offer stock instead of cash. And stock is very easy for companies to get, because shares are manufactured right there on the premises, all you have to do is type some zeroes into a spreadsheet, while dollars are much harder to come by. A company can only get dollars from customers or creditors. So when Amazon bids against Target for a key acquisition, or a key hire, Amazon can bid with shares they make by typing zeroes into a spreadsheet, and Target can only bid with dollars they get from selling stuff to us, or taking out loans, which is why Amazon generally wins those bidding wars. That's the upside of having a growth stock. But here's the downside: eventually a company has to stop growing. Like, say you get a 90% market share in your sector, how are you gonna grow? Once the market decides that you aren't a growth stock, once you become mature, your stock is revalued, to a P/E ratio befitting a mature stock. If you are an exec at a dominant company with a growth stock, you have to live in constant fear that the market will decide that you're not likely to grow any further. Think of what happened to Facebook in the first quarter of 2022. They told investors that they experienced slightly slower growth in the USA than they had anticipated, and investors panicked. They staged a one-day, $240B sell off. A quarter-trillion dollars in 24 hours! At the time, it was the largest, most precipitous drop in corporate valuation in human history. That's a monopolist's worst nightmare, because once you're presiding over a "mature" firm, the key employees you've been compensating with stock, experience a precipitous pay-drop and bolt for the exits, so you lose the people who might help you grow again, and you can only hire their replacements with dollars. With dollars, not shares. And the same goes for acquiring companies that might help you grow, because they, too, are going to expect money, not stock. This is the paradox of the growth stock. While you are growing to domination, the market loves you, but once you achieve dominance, the market lops 75% or more off your value in a single stroke if they don't trust your pricing power. Which is why growth stock companies are always desperately pumping up one bubble or another, spending billions to hype the pivot to video, or cryptocurrency, or NFTs, or Metaverse, or AI. I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. So this is why they're hyping AI: the material basis for the hundreds of billions in AI investment. # Now I want to talk about how they're selling AI. The growth narrative of AI is that AI will disrupt labor markets. I use "disrupt" here in its most disreputable, tech bro sense. The promise of AI – the promise AI companies make to investors – is that there will be AIs that can do your job, and when your boss fires you and replaces you with AI, he will keep half of your salary for himself, and give the other half to the AI company. That's it. That's the $13T growth story that MorganStanley is telling. It's why big investors and institutionals are giving AI companies hundreds of billions of dollars. And because they are piling in, normies are also getting sucked in, risking their retirement savings and their family's financial security. Now, if AI could do your job, this would still be a problem. We'd have to figure out what to do with all these technologically unemployed people. But AI can't do your job. It can help you do your job, but that doesn't mean it's going to save anyone money. Take radiology: there's some evidence that AIs can sometimes identify solid-mass tumors that some radiologists miss, and look, I've got cancer. Thankfully, it's very treatable, but I've got an interest in radiology being as reliable and accurate as possible. If my Kaiser hospital bought some AI radiology tools and told its radiologists: "Hey folks, here's the deal. Today, you're processing about 100 x-rays per day. From now on, we're going to get an instantaneous second opinion from the AI, and if the AI thinks you've missed a tumor, we want you to go back and have another look, even if that means you're only processing 98 x-rays per day. That's fine, we just care about finding all those tumors." If that's what they said, I'd be delighted. But no one is investing hundreds of billions in AI companies because they think AI will make radiology more expensive, not even if that also makes radiology more accurate. The market's bet on AI is that an AI salesman will visit the CEO of Kaiser and make this pitch: "Look, you fire 9/10s of your radiologists, saving $20m/year, you give us $10m/year, and you net $10m/year, and the remaining radiologists' job will be to oversee the diagnoses the AI makes at superhuman speed, and somehow remain vigilant as they do so, despite the fact that the AI is usually right, except when it's catastrophically wrong. "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human radiologist's fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis." This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes. This is another key to understanding – and thus deflating – the AI bubble. The AI can't do your job, but an AI salesman can convince your boss to fire you and replace you with an AI that can't do your job. This is key because it helps us build the kinds of coalitions that will be successful in the fight against the AI bubble. If you're someone who's worried about cancer, and you're being told that the price of making radiology too cheap to meter, is that we're going to have to re-home America's 32,000 radiologists, with the trade-off that no one will ever be denied radiology services again, you might say, "Well, OK, I'm sorry for those radiologists, and I fully support getting them job training or UBI or whatever. But the point of radiology is to fight cancer, not to pay radiologists, so I know what side I'm on." AI hucksters and their customers in the C-suites want the public on their side. They want to forge a class alliance between AI deployers and the people who enjoy the fruits of the reverse centaurs' labor. They want us to think of ourselves as enemies to the workers. Now, some people will be on the workers' side because of politics or aesthetics. They just like workers better than their bosses. But if you want to win over all the people who benefit from your labor, you need to understand and stress how the products of the AI will be substandard. That they are going to get charged more for worse things. That they have a shared material interest with you. Will those products be substandard? There's every reason to think so. Earlier, I alluded to "automation blindness, "the physical impossibility of remaining vigilant for things that rarely occur. This is why TSA agents are incredibly good at spotting water bottles. Because they get a ton of practice at this, all day, every day. And why they fail to spot the guns and bombs that government red teams smuggle through checkpoints to see how well they work, because they just don't have any practice at that. Because, to a first approximation, no one deliberately brings a gun or a bomb through a TSA checkpoint. Automation blindness is the Achilles' heel of "humans in the loop." Think of AI software generation: there are plenty of coders who love using AI, and almost without exception, they are senior, experienced coders, who get to decide how they will use these tools. For example, you might ask the AI to generate a set of CSS files to faithfully render a web-page across multiple versions of multiple browsers. This is a notoriously fiddly thing to do, and it's pretty easy to verify if the code works – just eyeball it in a bunch of browsers. Or maybe the coder has a single data file they need to import and they don't want to write a whole utility to convert it. Tasks like these can genuinely make coders more efficient and give them more time to do the fun part of coding, namely, solving really gnarly, abstract puzzles. But when you listen to business leaders talk about their AI plans for coders, it's clear they're not looking to make some centaurs. They want to fire a lot of tech workers – 500,000 over the past three years – and make the rest pick up their work with coding, which is only possible if you let the AI do all the gnarly, creative problem solving, and then you do the most boring, soul-crushing part of the job: reviewing the AIs' code. And because AI is just a word guessing program, because all it does is calculate the most probable word to go next, the errors it makes are especially subtle and hard to spot, because these bugs are literally statistically indistinguishable from working code (except that they're bugs). Here's an example: code libraries are standard utilities that programmers can incorporate into their apps, so they don't have to do a bunch of repetitive programming. Like, if you want to process some text, you'll use a standard library. If it's an HTML file, that library might be called something like lib.html.text.parsing; and if it's a DOCX file, it'll be lib.docx.text.parsing. But reality is messy, humans are inattentive and stuff goes wrong, so sometimes, there's another library, this one for parsing PDFs, and instead of being called lib.pdf.text.parsing, it's called lib.text.pdf.parsing. Now, because the AI is a statistical inference engine, because all it can do is predict what word will come next based on all the words that have been typed in the past, it will "hallucinate" a library called lib.pdf.text.parsing. And the thing is, malicious hackers know that the AI will make this error, so they will go out and create a library with the predictable, hallucinated name, and that library will get automatically sucked into your program, and it will do things like steal user data or try and penetrate other computers on the same network. And you, the human in the loop – the reverse centaur – you have to spot this subtle, hard to find error, this bug that is literally statistically indistinguishable from correct code. Now, maybe a senior coder could catch this, because they've been around the block a few times, and they know about this tripwire. But guess who tech bosses want to preferentially fire and replace with AI? Senior coders. Those mouthy, entitled, extremely highly paid workers, who don't think of themselves as workers. Who see themselves as founders in waiting, peers of the company's top management. The kind of coder who'd lead a walkout over the company building drone-targeting systems for the Pentagon, which cost Google ten billion dollars in 2018. For AI to be valuable, it has to replace high-wage workers, and those are precisely the experienced workers, with process knowledge, and hard-won intuition, who might spot some of those statistically camouflaged AI errors. Like I said, the point here is to replace high-waged workers. And one of the reasons the AI companies are so anxious to fire coders is that coders are the princes of labor. They're the most consistently privileged, sought-after, and well-compensated workers in the labor force. If you can replace coders with AI, who cant you replace with AI? Firing coders is an ad for AI. Which brings me to AI art. AI art – or "art" – is also an ad for AI, but it's not part of AI's business model. Let me explain: on average, illustrators don't make any money. They are already one of the most immiserated, precartized groups of workers out there. They suffer from a pathology called "vocational awe." That's a term coined by the librarian Fobazi Ettarh, and it refers to workers who are vulnerable to workplace exploitation because they actually care about their jobs – nurses, librarians, teachers, and artists. If AI image generators put every illustrator working today out of a job, the resulting wage-bill savings would be undetectable as a proportion of all the costs associated with training and operating image-generators. The total wage bill for commercial illustrators is less than the kombucha bill for the company cafeteria at just one of Open AI's campuses. The purpose of AI art – and the story of AI art as a death-knell for artists – is to convince the broad public that AI is amazing and will do amazing things. It's to create buzz. Which is not to say that it's not disgusting that former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati told a conference audience that "some creative jobs shouldn't have been there in the first place," and that it's not especially disgusting that she and her colleagues boast about using the work of artists to ruin those artists' livelihoods. It's supposed to be disgusting. It's supposed to get artists to run around and say, "The AI can do my job, and it's going to steal my job, and isn't that terrible?" Because the customers for AI – corporate bosses – don't see AI taking workers' jobs as terrible. They see it as wonderful. But can AI do an illustrator's job? Or any artist's job? Let's think about that for a second. I've been a working artist since I was 17 years old, when I sold my first short story, and I've given it a lot of thought, and here's what I think art is: it starts with an artist, who has some vast, complex, numinous, irreducible feeling in their mind. And the artist infuses that feeling into some artistic medium. They make a song, or a poem, or a painting, or a drawing, or a dance, or a book, or a photograph. And the idea is, when you experience this work, a facsimile of the big, numinous, irreducible feeling will materialize in your mind. Now that I've defined art, we have to go on a little detour. I have a friend who's a law professor, and before the rise of chatbots, law students knew better than to ask for reference letters from their profs, unless they were a really good student. Because those letters were a pain in the ass to write. So if you advertised for a postdoc and you heard from a candidate with a reference letter from a respected prof, the mere existence of that letter told you that the prof really thought highly of that student. But then we got chatbots, and everyone knows that you generate a reference letter by feeding three bullet points to an LLM, and it'll barf up five paragraphs of florid nonsense about the student. So when my friend advertises for a postdoc, they are flooded with reference letters, and they deal with this flood by feeding all these letters to another chatbot, and ask it to reduce them back to three bullet points. Now, obviously, they won't be the same bullet-points, which makes this whole thing terrible. But just as obviously, nothing in that five-paragraph letter except the original three bullet points are relevant to the student. The chatbot doesn't know the student. It doesn't know anything about them. It cannot add a single true or useful statement about the student to the letter. What does this have to do with AI art? Art is a transfer of a big, numinous, irreducible feeling from an artist to someone else. But the image-gen program doesn't know anything about your big, numinous, irreducible feeling. The only thing it knows is whatever you put into your prompt, and those few sentences are diluted across a million pixels or a hundred thousand words, so that the average communicative density of the resulting work is indistinguishable from zero. It's possible to infuse more communicative intent into a work: writing more detailed prompts, or doing the selective work of choosing from among many variants, or directly tinkering with the AI image after the fact, with a paintbrush or Photoshop or The Gimp. And if there will ever be a piece of AI art that is good art – as opposed to merely striking, or interesting, or an example of good draftsmanship – it will be thanks to those additional infusions of creative intent by a human. And in the meantime, it's bad art. It's bad art in the sense of being "eerie," the word Mark Fisher uses to describe "when there is something present where there should be nothing, or there is nothing present when there should be something." AI art is eerie because it seems like there is an intender and an intention behind every word and every pixel, because we have a lifetime of experience that tells us that paintings have painters, and writing has writers. But it's missing something. It has nothing to say, or whatever it has to say is so diluted that it's undetectable. The images were striking before we figured out the trick, but now they're just like the images we imagine in clouds or piles of leaves. We're the ones drawing a frame around part of the scene, we're the ones focusing on some contours and ignoring the others. We're looking at an inkblot, and it's not telling us anything. Sometimes that can be visually arresting, and to the extent that it amuses people in a community of prompters and viewers, that's harmless. I know someone who plays a weekly Dungeons and Dragons game over Zoom. It's transcribed by an open source model running locally on the dungeon master's computer, which summarizes the night's session and prompts an image generator to create illustrations of key moments. These summaries and images are hilarious because they're full of errors. It's a bit of harmless fun, and it bring a small amount of additional pleasure to a small group of people. No one is going to fire an illustrator because D&D players are image-genning funny illustrations where seven-fingered paladins wrestle with orcs that have an extra hand. But bosses have and will fire illustrators, because they fantasize about being able to dispense with creative professionals and just prompt an AI. Because even though the AI can't do the illustrator's job, an AI salesman can convince the illustrator's boss to fire them and replace them with an AI that can't do their job. This is a disgusting and terrible juncture, and we should not simply shrug our shoulders and accept Thatcherism's fatalism: "There is no alternative." So what is the alternative? A lot of artists and their allies think they have an answer: they say we should extend copyright to cover the activities associated with training a model. And I'm here to tell you they are wrong: wrong because this would inflict terrible collateral damage on socially beneficial activities, and it would represent a massive expansion of copyright over activities that are currently permitted – for good reason!. Let's break down the steps in AI training. First, you scrape a bunch of web-pages. This is unambiguously legal under present copyright law. You do not need a license to make a transient copy of a copyrighted work in order to analyze it, otherwise search engines would be illegal. Ban scraping and Google will be the last search engine we ever get, the Internet Archive will go out of business, that guy in Austria who scraped all the grocery store sites and proved that the big chains were colluding to rig prices would be in deep trouble. Next, you perform analysis on those works. Basically, you count stuff on them: count pixels and their colors and proximity to other pixels; or count words. This is obviously not something you need a license for. It's just not illegal to count the elements of a copyrighted work. And we really don't want it to be, not if you're interested in scholarship of any kind. And it's important to note that counting things is legal, even if you're working from an illegally obtained copy. Like, if you go to the flea market, and you buy a bootleg music CD, and you take it home and you make a list of all the adverbs in the lyrics, and you publish that list, you are not infringing copyright by doing so. Perhaps you've infringed copyright by getting the pirated CD, but not by counting the lyrics. This is why Anthropic offered a $1.5b settlement for training its models based on a ton of books it downloaded from a pirate site: not because counting the words in the books infringes anyone's rights, but because they were worried that they were going to get hit with $150k/book statutory damages for downloading the files. OK, after you count all the pixels or the words, it's time for the final step: publishing them. Because that's what a model is: a literary work (that is, a piece of software) that embodies a bunch of facts about a bunch of other works, word and pixel distribution information, encoded in a multidimensional array. And again, copyright absolutely does not prohibit you from publishing facts about copyrighted works. And again, no one should want to live in a world where someone else gets to decide which truthful, factual statements you can publish. But hey, maybe you think this is all sophistry. Maybe you think I'm full of shit. That's fine. It wouldn't be the first time someone thought that. After all, even if I'm right about how copyright works now, there's no reason we couldn't change copyright to ban training activities, and maybe there's even a clever way to wordsmith the law so that it only catches bad things we don't like, and not all the good stuff that comes from scraping, analyzing and publishing. Well, even then, you're not gonna help out creators by creating this new copyright. If you're thinking that you can, you need to grapple with this fact: we have monotonically expanded copyright since 1976, so that today, copyright covers more kinds of works, grants exclusive rights over more uses, and lasts longer. And today, the media industry is larger and more profitable than it has ever been, and also: the share of media industry income that goes to creative workers is lower than its ever been, both in real terms, and as a proportion of those incredible gains made by creators' bosses at the media company. So how it is that we have given all these new rights to creators, and those new rights have generated untold billions, and left creators poorer? It's because in a creative market dominated by five publishers, four studios, three labels, two mobile app stores, and a single company that controls all the ebooks and audiobooks, giving a creative worker extra rights to bargain with is like giving your bullied kid more lunch money. It doesn't matter how much lunch money you give the kid, the bullies will take it all. Give that kid enough money and the bullies will hire an agency to run a global campaign proclaiming "think of the hungry kids! Give them more lunch money!" Creative workers who cheer on lawsuits by the big studios and labels need to remember the first rule of class warfare: things that are good for your boss are rarely what's good for you. The day Disney and Universal filed suit against Midjourney, I got a press release from the RIAA, which represents Disney and Universal through their recording arms. Universal is the largest label in the world. Together with Sony and Warner, they control 70% of all music recordings in copyright today. It starts: "There is a clear path forward through partnerships that both further AI innovation and foster human artistry." It ends: "This action by Disney and Universal represents a critical stand for human creativity and responsible innovation." And it's signed by Mitch Glazier, CEO of the RIAA. It's very likely that name doesn't mean anything to you. But let me tell you who Mitch Glazier is. Today, Mitch Glazier is the CEO if the RIAA, with an annual salary of $1.3m. But until 1999, Mitch Glazier was a key Congressional staffer, and in 1999, Glazier snuck an amendment into an unrelated bill, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, that killed musicians' right to take their recordings back from their labels. This is a practice that had been especially important to "heritage acts" (which is a record industry euphemism for "old music recorded by Black people"), for whom this right represented the difference between making rent and ending up on the street. When it became clear that Glazier had pulled this musician-impoverishing scam, there was so much public outcry, that Congress actually came back for a special session, just to vote again to cancel Glazier's amendment. And then Glazier was kicked out of his cushy Congressional job, whereupon the RIAA started paying more than $1m/year to "represent the music industry." This is the guy who signed that press release in my inbox. And his message was: The problem isn't that Midjourney wants to train a Gen AI model on copyrighted works, and then use that model to put artists on the breadline. The problem is that Midjourney didn't pay RIAA members Universal and Disney for permission to train a model. Because if only Midjourney had given Disney and Universal several million dollars for training rights to their catalogs, the companies would have happily allowed them to train to their heart's content, and they would have bought the resulting models, and fired as many creative professionals as they could. I mean, have we already forgotten the Hollywood strikes? I sure haven't. I live in Burbank, home to Disney, Universal and Warner, and I was out on the line with my comrades from the Writers Guild, offering solidarity on behalf of my union, IATSE 830, The Animation Guild, where I'm a member of the writers' unit. And I'll never forget when one writer turned to me and said, "You know, you prompt an LLM exactly the same way an exec gives shitty notes to a writers' room. You know: 'Make me ET, except it's about a dog, and put a love interest in there, and a car chase in the second act.' The difference is, you say that to a writers' room and they all make fun of you and call you a fucking idiot suit. But you say it to an LLM and it will cheerfully shit out a terrible script that conforms exactly to that spec (you know, Air Bud)." These companies are desperate to use AI to displace workers. When Getty Images sues AI companies, it's not representing the interests of photographers. Getty hates paying photographers! Getty just wants to get paid for the training run, and they want the resulting AI model to have guardrails, so it will refuse to create images that compete with Getty's images for anyone except Getty. But Getty will absolutely use its models to bankrupt as many photographers as it possibly can. A new copyright to train models won't get us a world where models aren't used to destroy artists, it'll just get us a world where the standard contracts of the handful of companies that control all creative labor markets are updated to require us to hand over those new training rights to those companies. Demanding a new copyright just makes you a useful idiot for your boss, a human shield they can brandish in policy fights, a tissue-thin pretense of "won't someone think of the hungry artists?" When really what they're demanding is a world where 30% of the investment capital of the AI companies go into their shareholders' pockets. When an artist is being devoured by rapacious monopolies, does it matter how they divvy up the meal? We need to protect artists from AI predation, not just create a new way for artists to be mad about their impoverishment. And incredibly enough, there's a really simple way to do that. After 20+ years of being consistently wrong and terrible for artists' rights, the US Copyright Office has finally done something gloriously, wonderfully right. All through this AI bubble, the Copyright Office has maintained – correctly – that AI-generated works cannot be copyrighted, because copyright is exclusively for humans. That's why the "monkey selfie" is in the public domain. Copyright is only awarded to works of human creative expression that are fixed in a tangible medium. And not only has the Copyright Office taken this position, they've defended it vigorously in court, repeatedly winning judgments to uphold this principle. The fact that every AI created work is in the public domain means that if Getty or Disney or Universal or Hearst newspapers use AI to generate works – then anyone else can take those works, copy them, sell them, or give them away for free. And the only thing those companies hate more than paying creative workers, is having other people take their stuff without permission. The US Copyright Office's position means that the only way these companies can get a copyright is to pay humans to do creative work. This is a recipe for centaurhood. If you're a visual artist or writer who uses prompts to come up with ideas or variations, that's no problem, because the ultimate work comes from you. And if you're a video editor who uses deepfakes to change the eyelines of 200 extras in a crowd-scene, then sure, those eyeballs are in the public domain, but the movie stays copyrighted. But creative workers don't have to rely on the US government to rescue us from AI predators. We can do it ourselves, the way the writers did in their historic writers' strike. The writers brought the studios to their knees. They did it because they are organized and solidaristic, but also are allowed to do something that virtually no other workers are allowed to do: they can engage in "sectoral bargaining," whereby all the workers in a sector can negotiate a contract with every employer in the sector. That's been illegal for most workers since the late 1940s, when the Taft-Hartley Act outlawed it. If we are gonna campaign to get a new law passed in hopes of making more money and having more control over our labor, we should campaign to restore sectoral bargaining, not to expand copyright. Our allies in a campaign to expand copyright are our bosses, who have never had our best interests at heart. While our allies in the fight for sector bargaining are every worker in the country. As the song goes, "Which side are you on?" OK, I need to bring this talk in for a landing now, because I'm out of time, so I'm going to close out with this: AI is a bubble and bubbles are terrible. Bubbles transfer the life's savings of normal people who are just trying to have a dignified retirement to the wealthiest and most unethical people in our society, and every bubble eventually bursts, taking their savings with it. But not every bubble is created equal. Some bubbles leave behind something productive. Worldcom stole billions from everyday people by defrauding them about orders for fiber optic cables. The CEO went to prison and died there. But the fiber outlived him. It's still in the ground. At my home, I've got 2gb symmetrical fiber, because AT&T lit up some of that old Worldcom dark fiber. All things being equal, it would have been better if Worldcom hadn't ever existed, but the only thing worse than Worldcom committing all that ghastly fraud would be if there was nothing to salvage from the wreckage. I don't think we'll salvage much from cryptocurrency, for example. Sure, there'll be a few coders who've learned something about secure programming in Rust. But when crypto dies, what it will leave behind is bad Austrian economics and worse monkey JPEGs. AI is a bubble and it will burst. Most of the companies will fail. Most of the data-centers will be shuttered or sold for parts. So what will be left behind? We'll have a bunch of coders who are really good at applied statistics. We'll have a lot of cheap GPUs, which'll be good news for, say, effects artists and climate scientists, who'll be able to buy that critical hardware at pennies on the dollar. And we'll have the open source models that run on commodity hardware, AI tools that can do a lot of useful stuff, like transcribing audio and video, describing images, summarizing documents, automating a lot of labor-intensive graphic editing, like removing backgrounds, or airbrushing passersby out of photos. These will run on our laptops and phones, and open source hackers will find ways to push them to do things their makers never dreamt of. If there had never been an AI bubble, if all this stuff arose merely because computer scientists and product managers noodled around for a few years coming up with cool new apps for back-propagation, machine learning and generative adversarial networks, most people would have been pleasantly surprised with these interesting new things their computers could do. We'd call them "plugins." It's the bubble that sucks, not these applications. The bubble doesn't want cheap useful things. It wants expensive, "disruptive" things: Big foundation models that lose billions of dollars every year. When the AI investment mania halts, most of those models are going to disappear, because it just won't be economical to keep the data-centers running. As Stein's Law has it: "Anything that can't go on forever eventually stops." The collapse of the AI bubble is going to be ugly. Seven AI companies currently account for more than a third of the stock market, and they endlessly pass around the same $100b IOU. Bosses are mass-firing productive workers and replacing them with janky AI, and when the janky AI is gone, no one will be able to find and re-hire most of those workers, we're going to go from disfunctional AI systems to nothing. AI is the asbestos in the walls of our technological society, stuffed there with wild abandon by a finance sector and tech monopolists run amok. We will be excavating it for a generation or more. So we need to get rid of this bubble. Pop it, as quickly as we can. To do that, we have to focus on the material factors driving the bubble. The bubble isn't being driven by deepfake porn, or election disinformation, or AI image-gen, or slop advertising. All that stuff is terrible and harmful, but it's not driving investment. The total dollar figure represented by these apps doesn't come close to making a dent in the capital expenditures and operating costs of AI. They are peripheral, residual uses: flashy, but unimportant to the bubble. Get rid of all those uses and you reduce the expected income of AI companies by a sum so small it rounds to zero. Same goes for all that "AI Safety" nonsense, that purports to concern itself with preventing an AI from attaining sentience and turning us all into paperclips. First of all, this is facially absurd. Throwing more words and GPUs into the word-guessing program won't make it sentient. That's like saying, "Well, we keep breeding these horses to run faster and faster, so it's only a matter of time until one of our mares gives birth to a locomotive." A human mind is not a word-guessing program with a lot of extra words. I'm here for science fiction thought experiments, don't get me wrong. But also, don't mistake sf for prophesy. SF stories about superintelligence are futuristic parables, not business plans, roadmaps, or predictions. The AI Safety people say they are worried that AI is going to end the world, but AI bosses love these weirdos. Because on the one hand, if AI is powerful enough to destroy the world, think of how much money it can make! And on the other hand, no AI business plan has a line on its revenue projections spreadsheet labeled "Income from turning the human race into paperclips." So even if we ban AI companies from doing this, we won't cost them a dime in investment capital. To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies need a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side. Because the AI bubble really is very bad news, it's worth fighting seriously, and a serious fight against AI strikes at its roots: the material factors fueling the hundreds of billions in wasted capital that are being spent to put us all on the breadline and fill all our walls with high-tech asbestos.

Title: Millionaire YouTuber Hank Green tells Gen Z to rethink their Tesla bets—and shares the portfolio changes he’s making to avoid AI-bubble fallout

For years, YouTube star Hank Green has stuck to the same straightforward investing wisdom touted by legends like Warren Buffett: Put your money in an S&P 500 index fund and leave it alone. It’s advice that has paid off handsomely for millions of investors: This year alone, the index is up roughly some 16% and averaged more than 20% in gains over the past three years and roughly 14.6% over the past two decades. In most cases, it has easily beaten investors who try to pick individual stocks like Tesla or Meta. But as Wall Street frets over a possible AI-driven bubble—with voices from Big Short investor Michael Burry to economist Mohamed El-Erian sounding alarms—Green isn’t waiting around to see what happens. He’s already rethinking how much of his own wealth is tied to Big Tech. A major reason: The S&P 500 is more concentrated than ever. The top 10 companies—including Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta—make up nearly 40% of the entire index. And nearly all of them are pouring billions into AI. “I feel like my money is more exposed than I would like it to be,” Green said in a video that’s racked up over 1.6 million views. “I feel like by virtue of having a lot of my money in the S&P 500, I am now kind of betting on a big AI future. And that’s not a future that I definitely think is going to happen.” So Green is hedging. He’s taking 25% of the money he previously invested in S&P 500 index funds—a meaningful chunk for a self-made millionaire—and moving it into a more diversified set of assets, including: Green’s thesis is simple: Even if AI transforms the economy, the biggest winners may ultimately not be the mega-cap companies building the models. “I think that these giant companies providing the AI models will actually be competing with each other for those customers in part by competing on price,” Green said. “And that might mean that the value delivered to small companies will be bigger than value delivered to the big AI companies. Who knows, though? I just think that’s a thing that could happen.” And if his concerns are overblown? He’s fine with that, too. “If I’m wrong, 75% of my money is still in the safe place that everybody says your money should be, which is the S&P 500.” Gen Z continues to trail other generations in financial know-how—from saving and investing to understanding risk, according to TIAA. Moreover, one in four admit they are not confident in their financial knowledge and skill—a stark admission considering that one in seven Gen Z credit card users have maxed out their credit cards and many young people hold thousands in student loan debt. As a self-described “middle-aged, 45-year-old successful person,” Green said he’s trying to model what thoughtful, long-term decision-making actually looks like. And part of that effort includes dispelling one big misconception shared among some of his audience: “I get these comments from people who are like, I can’t believe that you’re participating in this Ponzi scheme,” Green told Fortune. “I do want to alienate those people, because I don’t believe that the stock market is a Ponzi scheme. I do think that it’s overvalued right now, but I think that it’s tied to real value that’s really created in the world.” His broader point: Investing isn’t about vibes or just dumping money into the hot stock of the week; rather, it’s something to seriously research. “A lot of people think that investing is like getting a Robinhood account and buying Tesla,” Green added. “And I’m like, ‘Nope, you’ve got to get a Fidelity account and buy a low-cost index fund everybody and or just keep it in your 401(k) and let the people who manage it manage it’—which is what a lot of people do, which is also fine.” His younger viewers are paying attention. One popular comment summed it up: “As a young person entering the point in my life where I’m starting to think about investing, I really appreciate you talking through your logic and giving a ton of disclaimers rather than telling me I should buy buy buy exactly what you buy buy buy.” The comment has already racked up more than 4,700 likes. While Green doesn’t come from a financial background, experts from the world of investing said they agree largely with his rationale: Having a diversified portfolio is the way to go—especially if you have worries about an AI bubble. “Unlike many dotcom companies, today’s tech giants generally have substantial revenue, cash reserves, and established business models beyond just AI,” certified financial planner Bo Hanson, host of The Money Guy Show, said in a video analyzing Green’s take. “Still, the concentration risk remains a valid concern for investors that are seeking diversification. However, this is precisely why we advise against putting all investments solely in the S&P 500, especially if you have a shorter time horizon.” Hanson added wise investors spread their money across various asset classes, including small-caps, international, and bonds, in order to reduce portfolio volatility and provide more consistent returns across various market environments. It’s sentiment echoed by Doug Ornstein, director at TIAA Wealth Management, who said it’s important to realize that not every investment needs to chase growth. “Particularly as you get older, having guaranteed income streams becomes crucial. Products like annuities can provide reliable payments regardless of market swings, creating a foundation of financial security,” Ornstein told Fortune. “Think of it as building a floor beneath your portfolio—one that market volatility can’t touch.”

By Rolling Stone If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Rolling Stone may receive an affiliate commission. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who are easy to shop for, and those who make the holiday season a little more challenging with their picky, well, let’s call it specific taste. With hundreds of websites to choose from, and the holidays fast approaching (most shipping deadlines are Dec. 17, 2025, to arrive in time for Christmas), how do you find unique gifts for the nice-list members who are a bit more particular? Our Rolling Stone editors have put together a guide featuring more than 60 of the best gifts to grab this holiday season. While most of these items are music-oriented — that’s what we do, after all — we’ve also included a few surprises that will make anyone feel merry and bright. From Grateful Dead collaborations to band merch that’s a lot more premium than digging through a bargain bin to the best in tech and tested audio equipment, these are our top-rated gifts for this holiday season. So go ahead, read, peek, and add to cart. It’s everything you didn’t know you were looking for, all in one place. From musician autobiographies to coffee-table books featuring your favorite bands, these are the best gifts for every reader. $22.17 $29.99 26% off Lawrence Burney’s debut, No Sense in Wishing: Essays, traces the author and cultural critic’s musical journey from his formative years in Baltimore to transformative experiences in Lagos and Johannesburg. Burney explores turning points like watching his mother perform as the opening act at a Gil Scott-Heron show, Lupe Fiasco introducing him to a kind of Blackness he initially thought was “corny as shit,“ and the New York fandom leading him to interrogate regional distinctions of Blackness. The collection of essays transcends the author’s personal self-searching to become a fresh ethno-musical study. $24.50 $35.00 30% off Cameron Crowe’s semi-autobiographical film, Almost Famous, was inspired by his early days as a teenage Rolling Stone reporter. Now, Crowe returns to that familiar territory, without the gloss of fiction. The Uncool is a memoir documenting a raucous time for rock & roll and a freewheeling moment in this publication’s history, when the merely 16-year-old Crowe profiled artists like Led Zeppelin and Jackson Browne. There’s no shortage of famous faces in The Uncool: David Bowie, Joni Mitchell, and Kris Kristofferson, to name a few. But there are some not-so-famous ones, too; Crowe dives deep on his family, offering a portrait of his parents and his Southern Californian upbringing. $50.37 $65.00 23% off Jill Furmanovsky’s Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere would have been the ideal tribute to what once was, if not for the unlikeliest of unlikely story lines — the brothers Gallagher reuniting for one of the most unforgettable tours in the history of rock & roll. Oasis: Trying to Find a Way Out of Nowhere features hundreds of photos of the band in the studio, onstage, and everywhere in between. Furmanovsky has photographed Oasis since the Definitely Maybe days, making this one of the most intimate looks at a band that would immodestly — but not incorrectly — call themselves Familiar to Millions. $107.23 $150.00 29% off Anton Corbijn’s music-video credits play like a greatest hits of rock from the 1980s onward. From U2 and Depeche Mode to Nirvana and Metallica, Corbijn has been there, camera in tow. This retrospective compiles hundreds of photographs from Corbijn’s archives, including portraits of R.E.M., the Rolling Stones, and Nick Cave. The book also includes written contributions from Adam Clayton of U2, Marlene Dumas, Johan Faes, Samantha Morton, and Tom Waits. $55.00 From her live performances to her music videos, Mitski has an undeniable power of drawing audiences in. Photographer Ebru Yıldız distills that electric energy into King of All the Land, a 144-page art book featuring powerful black-and-white images of Mitski, shot around Nashville. Yıldız is known largely for her portraits of musicians, from John Cale and David Byrne to Lucy Dacus and Angel Olsen. King of All the Land documents the synergy of two artists — Yıldız and Mitski — and their singular, uncompromising visions. $71.96 $100.00 28% off This photography book from rock & roll photographer Elliott Landy comprises nearly 400 images of the Band during a formative year from 1968 to ’69. The group was creating their first two albums, Music from Big Pink and The Band, which birthed a new Americana sound. “I don’t believe there will ever be anything that even vaguely resembles that kind of musical unity again. Nor does there need to be. They said it all,” writes Eric Clapton, in the book’s foreword. $69.90 $75.00 7% off This definitive behind-the-scenes book delivers the full story of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Journalist and author Jay Glennie worked with Quentin Tarantino to unearth photographs from the set, concept art, production memos, and other artifacts from the film’s creation. The book also includes more than 65 exclusive interviews with cast and crew members, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie. It’s a peek at how the double Oscar-winner was created, and Tarantino’s movie-making process. $14.50 Sometimes it’s far more interesting to dive into an autobiography than a fantasy novel — no shade to our beloved fiction favorites. But this one about Eighties pop icon Debbie Gibson is easily one of the most compelling reads to hit our list in years. At 178 pages, it’s a tight, intimate look at Gibson’s life and career. $12.81 $27.99 54% off Rob Sheffield — bestselling author, journalist, and longtime Rolling Stone contributing editor (since 1997, no big deal) — has written eight books on music, TV, and pop culture. His latest, Heartbreak Is the National Anthem, might be his most powerful yet.With an in-depth look into the life and legacy of Taylor Swift, he explores everything from the magical relationship she has with her fans and her songwriting prowess to her ability to captivate stadiums filled with 90,000 people. It’s a “Timeless” masterpiece that you’ll want to read over and over again. $11.99 Music journalist Jeff Weiss spent the first years of his career in Los Angeles working for celebrity tabloids at a time when the medium was at its peak. In the early 2000s, before blogs and social media pushed the industry off its track, Weiss carved out a niche as a young and hungry writer willing to concoct elaborate fake personas in order to chase down the day’s biggest story. Of course, the most prominent pop star of the time, Britney Spears, was always in his crosshairs. This book, which documents his time in the ethically murky industry, not only charts her rise from a bubbly Louisiana teen to her entry into a conservatorship but also wrestles with his own complicity in her downfall. While it’s not entirely nonfiction — Weiss has admitted that some of the scenes were created with literary license, though he’s declined to say exactly which ones — it’s a frenetic and engrossing read, perfect for anyone interested in Spears’ career or tabloid media’s race to the bottom. The most impressive part of the book is the care with which he comes at the subject. “I tried to make it a sympathetic portrayal of Britney,” Weiss told Rolling Stone earlier this year. “I didn’t want to be condescending to her.” $25.06 $29.00 14% off We know you’re not supposed to judge a book by its cover, but trust us, this paperback by Mark Ronson reads just as good as it looks. On sale for the holidays, it’s an authentic and compelling account from the man behind some of today’s most influential tracks. $33.17 $50.00 34% off Photography legend Jim Marshall’s book, The Grateful Dead: Photos and Stories From the Formative Years, 1966-1977, is the first-ever collection dedicated solely to his work with the Grateful Dead. This book features some of the most revealing and previously unseen images of the band, most of which were captured in San Francisco. It also includes notable musicians like Janis Joplin, Neil Young, David Crosby, and others. Additionally, the book includes an afterward by John Mayer, the frontman and guitarist of Dead & Company. It features colored edges, making it a perfect gift for fans of the psychedelic scene of the 1960s and 1970s. Whether they’re a fan from afar or proudly “with the band,” these gifts — from home decor to limited-edition games and instruments — are must-haves for any music devotee. $45.00 Noah Kahan’s beloved album Stick Season may have dropped in 2022, but our staff still has it on repeat (just peek at a few of our Spotify Wrapped receipts). If there’s a Kahan fan in your life, or honestly just someone who lives in New England, grab this Stick Season candle by Ranger Station. It smells like a chilly day in Maine, but without the frostbite. The brand notes it has a long burn time too, of up to 30 hours. $36.98 $75.00 51% off Barbie has released plenty of diva dolls over the years — there was the recent Stevie Nicks launch, the Aaliyah Barbie that sold out in seconds, and now a drop dedicated to the Queen of Christmas herself, Mariah Carey. Decked out in her sparkly red dress, this rare doll is already almost sold out on Amazon. So if you’re waiting for the right “tiiiiiime!” to add it to your cart for the collector in your life, this is it. $21.25 $25.00 15% off Shopping for musicians can be trickier than it seems — most are extremely particular about their gear (understandably so; not every axe is created equal). That’s why we suggest something like this leather guitar-pick holder. It’s way less pressure than choosing a new guitar for them, but just as useful — and it still feels thoughtful. Plus, Etsy notes that you can engrave the case, making them feel like the rock star they already are. $1,210.00 Ah, sometimes we miss the nostalgic days of the boombox era … OK, we’re mostly kidding, because playing music on your phone is definitely more convenient. But that longing for the good-old days pops up now and then. That’s why we love this necklace from editor-favorite brand Sydney Evan. It’s cheeky yet chic and makes a great gift for yourself or the fellow Nineties wild child in your life. $79.96 Good golly, Miss Dolly! The country superstar has done it again: this time with wines that taste far more premium than their affordable price tag. Available on the Home Shopping Network in various multi-packs, these Dolly Parton-branded wines come in adorable packaging with an even punchier taste. They’re the perfect gift for any holiday soiree or secret Santa exchange. $16.30 If you want presents as unique as the person receiving them, Uncommon Goods is our go-to. These music-themed playing cards feature legends like Amy Winehouse, David Bowie, and Prince, making them an ace when it comes to gifting. Grab a deck for as low as $16. $39.99 Surprise your favorite Metallica fan with the very same stainless-steel tumbler used by James Ulrich onstage. He even has a specially designed microphone stand with a bottle holder for his Yeti when he’s performing live. This 20-ounce cup keeps cold drinks cold and hot drinks hot — whether you’re singing onstage or having a casual karaoke sesh by the fire this holiday season. $329.00 $388.00 15% off If you want to win the award for giving your favorite musician the coolest gift they’ve ever received (or seen, for that matter), this sampler is it. For less than $330, it’s “packed with over 400 handcrafted instruments and sounds from iconic reggae producers, plus a synth engine with classic bass and lead tones and pressure-sensitive dub sirens,” according to the brand. $1,149.00 This gorgeous, compact, and incredibly playable instrument will instantly become anyone’s couch guitar of choice, and it’s also set up with the electronics you need to play out. As the brand-new junior model of Jeff Tweedy’s just-reissued signature 00DB — which aimed to emulate Woody Guthrie’s guitars of choice — it’s also shockingly affordable for a Martin signature guitar, with a tight, punchy sound. It’s made of sustainable wood too. Only one warning: If you buy this thing and fail to instantly write “Handshake Drugs”-level masterpieces on it, that’s on you. $50.00 Valhalla digital plugins are the behind-the-scenes secret sauce on everything from pop smashes to single-stream hopefuls. Always affordable, simple to use, and beautifully designed, their newest drop, FutureVerb’s clean spaces pair easily with highly colored echoes, transforming generic ho-hum sounds into towering epic studio ’scapes. $24.95 “Roll dice and leave your bummers behind,” advertises Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey, a new game from Twogether Studios. This game does all that and more, as you roll extremely groovy dice (they’re tie-dye, obviously), and take trips around the iconic frontman’s artwork while accumulating tokens. The packaging also includes a “cosmic journey bag” that you can use for the game pieces or … other items. “My dad’s legacy lives on through moments of joy, laughter, and connection,” Trixie Garcia said in a statement. “Like music, games foster community, and Jerry Garcia’s Cosmic Journey is a whimsical way for fans to keep that spirit alive wherever the road may lead.” Amen to that. $17.98 The Twice trio recorded their own version of Huntr/x’s original diss track “Takedown” for this film’s soundtrack, and the group’s own song “Strategy” is also included in the film and on the album. Even if you’ve just had the Saja Boys’ infectious “Soda Pop” stuck in your head for weeks (we don’t blame you, us too), then you’ll want to order it now before it sells out ahead of the holidays. The CD comes with a fold-out poster and photo card (random one of three), like a real K-pop album. What better way to celebrate the White Stripes’ recent induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame than with this stunner? The Complete Studio Albums marks the first time the band’s six records have been compiled together, from their 1999 self-titled debut all the way to their final masterpiece, 2007’s Icky Thump. The box set’s slipcase features previously unseen images of your favorite duo in their home of Detroit: On the front, Jack and Meg are seen on the Ambassador Bridge, which overlooks the Detroit River, while on the back, they’re standing outside Duly’s Place Coney Island. Plus, this is a Third Man Records release, so you just know it’s going to be pressed on colorful wax, and they really deliver here, with each album sporting a red-and-white “coin-flip” look. The Complete Studio Albums is a limited edition. Or, as Third Man’s co-founder and White Stripes’ archivist Ben Blackwell said, “You’re not going to just find these at any old bodega on the street!” While this specific product is sold out (we hope it comes back soon), you can shop more White Stripes vinyl and box sets here. $215.00 Shopping for a Wilco fan? All you need is this box set and tickets to one of their upcoming shows, and you can check them off your list twice in one go. $99.00 Backpack-sized and ready to fit into every producer’s setup, this is going to become a must, especially for laptop warriors. With real people-size controls, a screen so you can see what all the many, many knobs are actually doing, and a way to hit stop when your jam gets out of control, Akai’s new midi controller finally gets this small form factor right. $349.99 A turntable is always a great gift — whether they live and breathe vinyl or just want to give their living space a retro upgrade. $26.14 $32.99 21% off Bummed the five-foot-tall superstar’s Short n’ Sweet tour is over? Continue the sleepover party with these two dazzling records: The recent Grammy-nominated Man’s Best Friend and her 2023 Christmas EP, Fruitcake. The former is available in several spectacular vinyl variants, from iridescent blue to light brown, as well as several alternate covers that are worth getting your hands on. Fruitcake, one of the strongest Christmas albums from a pop star in years, is jam-packed (no pun intended) with Carpenter’s signature melodies and innuendos, only holiday themed (“I need that Charles Dickens,” she sings on “A Nonsense Christmas”). The milky, clear, and liquid glitter vinyl sold out instantly, but plenty of other colors are available. Put that on with Carpenter’s 2024 Christmas special in the background, and you’ll have a ho-ho holiday. $23.99 A gift that transcends generations, this limited-edition Buckingham Nicks baby-blue vinyl is a present worth fighting over. Perfect for your cousin who just discovered Fleetwood Mac on TikTok — or your grandmother who hasn’t stopped playing it since the Seventies. It’s a Yankee Swap winner. $20.99 Wondering what to do with your stack of cassettes after your 2006 Honda finally bit the dust? For those of us still committed to portable physical media — without the CD skips — Amazon has a perfect solution. This portable cassette player lets you revisit your collection using your favorite wired or wireless headphones. The best part is its ability to record, too, meaning endless possibilities to impress that special someone with a good old-fashioned mix tape. $39.99 For the aspiring studio rat in your life, give them a break and get them what they won’t get themselves. A way to figure out what’s wrong when there’s no sound happening. This affordable Swiss army knife of a cable tester will help them figure out that they need to take better care of their connections. From the best Bluetooth speakers to over-ear cans that block out the world, these tech-forward gifts are everything they’ve been wanting this season. $129.00 $149.00 13% off With a stylish transparent case and plenty of smart features, Nothing’s earbuds are a standout, and the sound quality outperforms a lot of the competition at this price. Replace your giftee’s old, tired buds this season with a fresh new pair (for 13 percent off). $179.99 From its long-lasting battery life (30-plus hours on a charge) to its packable frame, the Marshall Emberton speaker checks all of our boxes for a great, reliable outdoor speaker. We’ve used ours to play music outside for months (and left it there, accidentally), because that’s what it’s designed to do. It can handle rain, serious dust, and hours of tunes. Bonus: The retro design instantly makes any patio look cooler. $59.95 Over the past couple of years, Loop has established itself as the leader in universal-fit earplugs. Most of our staff (myself included) have extensively tested the brand’s bestsellers and can confidently say the hype is real. I love their metallic, jewelry-like design, which makes them better-looking than most earplugs (unless you want total discretion). More importantly, I love the excellent noise-reduction that turns down the volume without sacrificing audio quality.The Loop Switch 2 is our top pick from the brand. Unlike most earplugs, you can adjust how much volume is let in by shifting a dial (no need to swap tips). The plugs have three modes: “Quiet,” “Experience,” and “Engage,” ranging from almost full quiet to noise-dampening. The former is great for non-concert activities, as well as extremely loud shows, while the “Engage” option is ideal for full immersion and occasional conversations. $499.99 $599.99 17% off Polaroid’s flagship camera will take your instant photos to the next level. With tack-sharp autofocus and fully-manual controls built into the camera (and even more available via an App), you can take full command behind the lens. The I-2 lens contains the largest aperture of any Polaroid camera to date, allowing for beautiful portraits and lower-light shooting that was never possible before. $649.00 $849.95 24% off The X Half combines analog ideas in a digital format. At its simplest, the camera is fun-sized, vertically-oriented, and loaded up with Fuji’s signature-film presets based on the brand’s own classic film stocks. To really turn up the old-school experience, there is a “film camera mode” that prevents image previews, which requires the user to use a film advance lever to enable the next frame. In standard mode, that same lever can also be used to enable split-frame photography, much like the original half-frame cameras that it is based on. $449.99 $549.00 18% off I first tried these headphones last summer, when a manager played me a song on them. I was stunned by the sound quality and immediately asked what brand they were. There’s a lot to love with the AirPods Max: The sound is expansive and truly noise-cancelling; they instantly connect to all of my devices; and they have a long battery life. Plus, they’re available in flattering colors and actually fit my tiny head, unlike previous headphones. They sit snug and comfortably in place, whether I’m sitting at my desk, walking around New York City, or even running on the treadmill. It’s a steep price, but totally worth it when I think about how much use I’m getting out of them and how perfect a gift they’d make. $699.99 You know a gift is truly great when it’s sold out almost everywhere — who doesn’t remember the Cabbage Patch craze of the Eighties? Luckily, we tracked down the Marshall Heston 60 soundbar, still available at Best Buy in limited quantities. While it comes with a $699 price tag, it’ll amp up movie night for any cinephile in your life. $89.00 $99.00 10% off Finding a great gift can already feel like a win, but scoring one on sale makes the season even merrier and brighter. Take this wireless audio streamer, for instance: Available on Amazon with delivery in less than two days via Prime, it’s a fun little gadget that fits neatly on a desk or bedside table. $1,199.99 $1,499.99 20% off Our staff tested dozens of speakers this year, and Klipsch’s the Sevens were the best in terms of sound, price, and design. The midcentury-inspired bookshelf speakers deliver a beautiful sound stage and a warm, full experience — no matter what kind of music you’re playing. They don’t require an amp, making them a great gift for audiophiles and newbies alike. $399.99 $449.00 11% off Bose’s latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones, released in October, combine the all-day comfort and industry-leading noise canceling Bose is known for with subtle, but genuinely useful upgrades over the original 2023 model. The latest generation of the headphones features a similar design to the first generation, but with polished metal yokes instead of matte. While I personally preferred the understated matte accents, the QC Ultra 2 headphones nonetheless have a stylish, high-end look. They’re lightweight, but the headband and ear cups have ample, comfortable cushioning. Overall, when it comes to performance and features, noise-canceling and audio quality, and comfort and design, the QC Ultra 2 headphones are as close to the complete package as anything on the market. While we love digging through concert merch bins and scouring our favorite thrift shops for the coolest band gear, these clothing picks are just as awesome — with half the effort. $68.00 Imogene + Willie offers some of the softest 100-percent cotton graphic tees, as well as adorable caps and beanies. Originally a denim company, Imogene + Willie has evolved into a full retail shop with brick-and-mortar locations in Austin and Nashville. Their designs are heavily influenced by music, and they collaborate with artists like Willie Nelson, Waylon Jennings, and Billy Strings, as well as iconic venues like the Grand Ole Opry. Their clothing is both stylish and cozy, creating a perfect concert outfit. We test a lot of clothing at Rolling Stone, but there’s one brand we keep coming back to: Dr. Martens. The iconic footwear company just dropped these new stud-covered shoes, and we’re already chomping at the bit to wear them to our next rock concert. Sure, they’d make an epic gift for anyone on your nice list, but honestly? They’re the kind of steal you should snap up for yourself while they’re still in stock. $250.00+ There’s no shortage of merch for Deadheads, from dog bowls to toothbrush holders. And don’t even get us started on apparel. The Dead have done collaborations with everyone from Old Navy to designer Gabriela Hearst. So, where does one get the best Steal Your Face sweater? Look no further than Alice + Olivia, who just released their new collab with the Dead (their second since 2016) in honor of the iconic band’s 60th anniversary. It’s difficult not to be overwhelmed by the amount of stellar items they have, but I recommend the skull pullover and muscle tank, which are great quality and fit perfectly. However, any of the items make a great gift for the Deadhead in your life — they’re sure to be merry and grateful. $125.00 You know what they say: The best time to wear a striped sweater is all the time — especially when it’s covered in embroidered emblems. Available in sizes from small to 2XL, there are “No Surprises” with this Radiohead jumper: It’s high-quality, has a premium design, and will make your giftee look like the opposite of a “Creep.” $17.40 Socks can be a controversial gift, does Dad really need another pair of crisp, white calf coverings? But this black-and-white pair, made in collaboration with American band Blue Angel, is a massive upgrade from the basic gift. $110.00 Sometimes it’s worth taking style tips from some of our favorite celebrities, like Matthew McConaughey and Brooke Shields, and this time, they were definitely right about Caddis glasses. The eyewear brand, which has been crafting some of Hollywood’s favorite reading and prescription frames since 2017, is a viral sensation — and one that actually lives up to the hype. With multiple styles to choose from, Caddis glasses keep anyone on trend, whether it’s just for fun (sunglasses) or for necessity (progressive readers). $110.00+ The perfect gift for any jam-band fan is a vintage T-shirt from Jesse Lockwood’s Primarily Dead shop. While the shop (which has been operating since 2020) features primarily Dead items (as its name suggests), it also offers T-shirts, stickers, and more from bands like Phish, the Allman Brothers, Pink Floyd, and other classic-rock and jam bands. Lockwood is very selective about what he sells, offering an array of choices, telling Rolling Stone, “Every one of these shirts has a story to tell — some were made and sold by fans in small batches in parking lots just to generate enough money to get to the next show, some are licensed single-show shirts made by the band and only sold at that venue, and others were more widely available. They all create a nostalgic feeling for both the people that were there and the people that wish they could have been there.” Lockwood also sources shirts. If you are looking for something specific, contact him on Instagram @primarily_dead or through his website, https://www.primarilydead.com/. $76.00 They don’t have to be a star on the court to love this Tennis Brat crew-neck sweater. This social media sensation works for every It-girl (or It-boy) on your shopping list thanks to the brand’s premium fabrics, easy fit, and unmistakable logo. $224.25 $299.00 25% off It’s no secret that the little black bricks in our pockets can be a major attention hog, but paradoxically, there are some situations where integrating tech in more places makes it less obtrusive. Take Meta’s Ray-Ban glasses, which let you record photos, video, and more, all while keeping your phone securely stashed. First released in 2023, Meta’s Ray-Ban AI glasses have outlasted other smart glasses for one simple, undeniable reason — they don’t look ridiculous. Instead, Meta smartly leveraged the recognizable style of the world’s most iconic eyewear brand, landing on a design that’s barely more conspicuous than regular Wayfarers. If you want an all-encompassing gift — from gaming gear to experiential presents — these finds are perfect for a variety of ages and interests. $59.99 If there’s just one game you need to play from 2025, it’s Sandfall Interactive’s Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. The French RPG draws inspiration from Japanese titans of the genre like Final Fantasy, with a dynamic combat system that blends turn-based strategy and rhythmic parrying. And while the action is engaging, it’s the heartbreaking narrative and world-building that’s made the year’s most talked-about game a sensation. Set in a fantasy realm where a divine entity known as the Paintress eradicates everyone over a certain age year after year, players take on the roles of the latest band of would-be saviors on a suicide mission to bring humanity back from the brink. With award-worthy voice work from actors like Charlie Cox, Jennifer Hale, and Andy Serkis, the story presented in-game is a genuine tearjerker, and should be experienced by the widest possible audience, even if RPGs aren’t normally your bag. $498.88 A new generation of Nintendo hardware is always an event, but there’s some special alchemy that’s put Switch 2 on another level. The hybrid handheld/home console has quickly become the fastest selling console of all time, largely in part because of its, frankly, insane lineup of new games and the ability to play legacy Switch titles.The console’s library includes all-new releases like Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, Kirby Air Riders, and Metroid Prime 4 — many of which are among the best games of the year — on top of upgraded versions of classics like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. With great ports of high-end games like Cyberpunk 2077 and indies like Hades II, Switch 2 is one of the most diverse platforms available, with something for every kind of player. $399.99 A good pair of gaming headphones is essential these days, as cinematic experiences and high-stakes online competition demand the best possible soundscape. And while it’s one thing to hear well, Razer Kraken V4 Pro cans provide a visceral physical response to in-game action with HD haptics. What does that mean? It’s essentially the tactile feedback (a.k.a. vibrations) that are now standard in all game controllers but applied to the headset.On PC, Kraken V4 Pro headphones can be paired with other Razer devices via Synapse to create a unique user profile — with certain titles like Borderlands 4 having been custom-tuned to provide haptic feedback and THX spatial audio tailored to the game. But using the OLED control hub, it can connect to basically anything (Switch, PS5, even mobile devices) via BlueTooth, USB, or auxiliary cable. It’s like having a rumbling IMAX theater wrapped around your head. $25.00+ Some people prefer to gift experiences rather than tangible items, and we’re 100 percent on board. A StubHub gift card lets them choose an event near them — whether it’s a concert, comedy show, or dance performance. There’s something for every type of fan. $6.00+ MasterClass is one of the internet’s favorite ways to learn a new skill, with courses on everything from music to acting to cooking. The best part? Every course is taught by an expert in the field, and many are also A-list celebrities. Gift it this holiday season for as low as $6. $65.00 Longtime cannabis activist Jane West got her start making accessories way back in 2016, right around the time weed was legalized in her home state of Colorado. She’d been working to promote women within the male-dominated industry, and her product line was similarly focused. We’ve been fans for the past decade, partaking in her ever-growing line of pipes, one-hitters, bongs, and bubblers, sometimes disguised as makeup compacts for discreet use. But her newest endeavor, the Twenties Collection, is by far our favorite. Inspired by Art Deco designs, these cut-glass objects are as beautiful as they are functional, and this hand pipe has become our favorite smoking object in our extensive arsenal. $90.00 There’s an unspoken competition about who looks best on the slopes, and these Grateful Dead and Knockaround snow goggles will help your favorite snowboarder or skier claim the title. Grab them at Dick’s Sporting Goods for under $100. $199.25 Building Lego’s 1,074-piece Fender Stratocaster set feels almost as gratifying as performing a solo on the guitar used by legends from Jimi Hendrix to Kurt Cobain. Everything here feels true to life, albeit miniaturized, including the Lego brick-based guitar’s pickup switch, tuning pegs, textile strap, stand, and picks (you have a choice of four colors). The best part? The fact that the set comes with an opportunity to view the final piece’s interior details, like its motherboard, not to mention that you can create the guitar in either black or red. Ideal for both rock & roll aficionados and the Lego-obsessed, this is a holiday gift that will keep on giving. After all, your recipient can rebuild it an endless amount of times (and our editors recommend doing just that). $9.99 We may be biased, but a Rolling Stone subscription is about as good as it gets.

Title: Sam Altman's Dirty DRAM Deal

Home Videos Podcasts Articles GPU Chart Merchandise Support Us! More... Written by Tom of Moore’s Law Is Dead Special Assistance by KarbinCry & kari-no-sugata Based on this Video: https://youtu.be/BORRBce5TGw At the beginning of November, I ordered a 32GB DDR5 kit for pairing with a Minisforum BD790i X3D motherboard, and three weeks later those very same sticks of DDR5 are now listed for a staggering $330– a 156% increase in price from less than a month ago! At this rate, it seems likely that by Christmas, that DDR5 kit alone could be worth more than the entire Zen 4 X3D platform I planned to pair it with! How could this happen, and more specifically – how could this happen THIS quickly? Well, buckle up! I am about to tell you the story of Sam Altman’s Dirty DRAM Deal, or: How the AI bubble, panic, and unpreparedness stole Christmas... But before I dive in, let me make it clear that my RAM kit’s 156% jump in price isn’t a fluke or some extreme example of what's going on right now. Nope, and in fact, I'd like to provide two more examples of how how impossible it is becoming to get ahold of RAM - these were provided by a couple of our sources within the industry: One source that works at a US Retailer, stated that a RAM Manufacturer called them in order to inquire if they might buy RAM from them to stock up for their other customers. This would be like Corsair asking a Best Buy if they had any RAM around. Another source that works at a Prebuilt PC company, was recently given an estimate for when they would receive RAM orders if they placed them now…and they were told December…of 2026! So what happened? Well, it all comes down to three perfectly synergistic events: OpenAI executed two unprecedented RAM deals that took everyone by surprise. The secrecy and size of the deals triggered full-scale panic buying from everyone else. The market had almost zero safety stock left due to tariffs, worry about decreasing RAM prices over the summer, and stalled equipment transfers. Below, we’re going to walk through each of these factors — and then I’m going to warn you about which hardware categories will be hit the hardest, which products are already being cancelled, and what you should buy right now before the shelves turn into a repeat of 2021–2022...because this is doomed to turn into much more than just RAM scarcity... On October 1st OpenAI signed two simultaneous deals with Samsung and SK Hynix for 40% of the worlds DRAM supply. Now, did OpenAI’s competition suspect some big RAM deals could be signed in late 2025? Yes. Ok, but did they think it would be deals this huge and with multiple companies? NO! In fact, if you go back and read reporting on Sam Altman’s now infamous trip to South Korea on October 1st, even just mere hours before the massive deals with Samsung and SK Hynix were simultaneously signed – most reporting simply mentioned vague reports about Sam talking to Samsung, SK Hynix, TSMC, and Foxconn. But the reporting at the time was soft, almost dismissive — “exploring ties,” “seeking cooperation,” “probing for partnerships.” Nobody hinted that OpenAI was about to swallow up to 40% of global DRAM output – even on morning before it happened! Nobody saw this coming - this is clear in the lack of reporting about the deals before they were announced, and every MLID Source who works in DRAM manufacturing and distribution insist this took everyone in the industry by surprise. To be clear - the shock wasn’t that OpenAI made a big deal, no, it was that they made two massive deals this big, at the same time, with Samsung and SK Hynix simultaneously! In fact, according to our sources - both companies had no idea how big each other's deal was, nor how close to simultaneous they were. And this secrecy mattered. It mattered a lot. Had Samsung known SK Hynix was about to commit a similar chunk of supply — or vice-versa — the pricing and terms would have likely been different. It’s entirely conceivable they wouldn’t have both agreed to supply such a substantial part of global supply if they had known more...but at the end of the day - OpenAI did succeed in keeping the circles tight, locking down the NDAs, and leveraging the fact that these companies assumed the other wasn’t giving up this much wafer volume simultaneously…in order to make a surgical strike on the global RAM supply chain…and it's worked so far... Imagine you're running a hyper scaler, or maybe you’re a major OEM, or perhaps pretend that you are simply one of OpenAI’s chief competitors: On October 1st of 2025, you would have woken up to the news that OpenAI had just cornered the memory market more aggressively than any company in the last decade, and you hadn't heard even a murmur that this was coming beforehand! Well, you would probably make some follow-up calls to colleagues in the industry, and then also quickly hear rumors that it wasn't just you - also the two largest suppliers didn’t even see each other’s simultaneous cooperation with OpenAI coming either! You wouldn't go: “Well, that’s an interesting coincidence”, no, you would say: “WHAT ELSE IS GOING ON THAT WE DON’T KNOW ABOUT?” Again – it’s not the size of the deals that's solely the issue here, no, it’s also the unexpectedness and brazenness of them. On October 1st silicon valley executives and procurement managers panicked over concerns like these: What other deals don’t we know about? Is this just the first of many? None of our DRAM suppliers warned us ahead of time! We have to assume they also won't in the future, and that it’s possible all of global DRAM could be bought up without us getting a single warning! We know OpenAI’s competitors are already panic-buying! If we don’t move now, we might be locked out of the market until 2028! OpenAI’s competitors, OEMs, and cloud providers scrambled to secure whatever inventory remained out of self-defense, and self-defense in a world that was entirely defenseless due to the accelerant I’ll now explain in Part III... Normally, the DRAM market has buffers: warehouses of emergency stock, excess wafer starts, older DRAM manufacturing machinery being sold off to budget brands while the big brands upgrade their production lines…but not in 2025, in 2025 those would-be buffers were depleted for three separate reasons: Tariff Chaos. Companies had deliberately reduced how much DRAM they ordered for their safety stock over the summer of 2025 because tariffs were changing almost weekly. Every RAM purchase risked being made at the wrong moment – and so fewer purchases were made. Prices had been falling all summer. Because of the hesitancy to purchase as much safety stock as usual, RAM prices were also genuinely falling over time. And, obviously when memory is getting cheaper month over month, the last thing you’d feel is pressured to buy a commodity that could be cheaper the next month…so everyone waited. Secondary RAM Manufacturing Had Stalled. Budget brands normally buy older DRAM fabrication equipment from mega-producers like Samsung when Samsung upgrades their DRAM lines to the latest and greatest equipment. This allows the DRAM market to expand more than it would otherwise because it makes any upgrading of the fanciest production lines to still be additive change to the market. However, Korean memory firms have been terrified that reselling old equipment to China-adjacent OEMs might trigger U.S. retaliation…and so those machines have been sitting idle in warehouses since early spring. Yep, there was no cushion. OpenAI hit the market at the exact moment it was least prepared. And now time for the biggest twist of all, a twist that’s actually public information, and therefore should be getting discussed by far more people in this writer's opinion: OpenAI isn’t even bothering to buy finished memory modules! No, their deals are unprecedentedly only for raw wafers — uncut, unfinished, and not even allocated to a specific DRAM standard yet. It’s not even clear if they have decided yet on how or when they will finish them into RAM sticks or HBM! Right now it seems like these wafers will just be stockpiled in warehouses – like a kid who hides the toybox because they’re afraid nobody wants to play with them, and thus selfishly feels nobody but them should get the toys! And let’s just say it: Here is the uncomfortable truth Sam Altman is always loath to admit in interviews: OpenAI is worried about losing its lead. The last 18 months have seen competitors catching up fast — Anthropic, Meta, xAI, and specifically Google’s Gemini 3 has gotten a ton of praise just in the past week. Everyone’s chasing training capacity. Everyone needs memory. DRAM is the lifeblood of scaling inference and training throughput. Cutting supply to your rivals is not a conspiracy theory. It’s a business tactic as old as business itself. And so, when you consider how secretive OpenAI was about their deals with Samsung and SK Hynix, but additionally how unready they were to immediately utilize their warehouses of DRAM wafers – it sure seems like a primary goal of these deals was to deprive the market, and not just an attempt to protect OpenAI's own supply… Alright, now that we are done explaining the how, let’s get to the “now what?” – because even if the RAM shortage miraculously improves immediately behind the scenes – even if the AI Bubble instantly popped or 10 companies started tooling up for more DRAM capacity this second (and many are, to be fair), at a minimum the next six to nine months are already screwed. See above: DRAM manufactures are quoting 13-Month lead times for DDR5! This is not a temporary blip. This could be a once-in-a-generation shock. So what gets hit first? What gets hit hardest? Well, below is an E through S-Tier ranking of which products are "the most screwed": S-Tier (Already Screwed – Too Late to Buy) - RAM itself, obviously. RAM prices have “exploded”. The detonation is in the past. A-Tier (Almost Screwed – Don’t Wait to Buy!!!) SSDs. These tends to follow DRAM pricing with a lag. Small Prebuilt PC Companies. That lack large buffers of inventory. RADEON GPUs. AMD doesn’t bundle RAM in their BOM kits to AIBs the way Nvidia does. In fact, the RX 9070 GRE 16GB this channel leaked months ago is almost certainly cancelled according to our sources. XBOX. Microsoft didn’t plan. Prices may rise and/or supply may dwindle in 2026. B-Tier (Eventually Screwed – Don’t wait much longer to buy!) Nvidia GPUs. Nvidia maintains large memory inventories for its board partners, giving them a buffer. But high-capacity GPUs (like a hypothetical 24GB 5080 SUPER) are on ice for now because those stores were never sufficiently built up. In fact, Nvidia is quietly telling partners that their SUPER refresh “might” launch Q3 2026 – although most partners think it’s just a placeholder for when Nvidia expects new capacity to come online, and thus SUPER may never launch. C-Tier (Think about buying soon) Laptops and phones. These companies negotiate immense long-term contracts, so they’re not hit immediately. But once their stockpiles run dry, watch out! D-Tier (Consider buying soon, but there’s no rush) PlayStation. Sony planned better than almost anyone else. They bought aggressively during the summer price trough, which is why they can afford a Black Friday discount while everyone else is raising prices. E-Tier (Prices might actually drop) Anything without RAM. Specifically CPUs that do not come with coolers could see price drops over time since there could be a drop in demand for CPUs if nobody has the RAM to feed them in systems. ???-Tier —Steam Machine. Valve keeps things quiet, but the big unknown is whether they pre-bought RAM months ago before announcing their much-hyped Steam Machine. If they did already stockpile an ample supply of DDR5 - then Steam Machine should launch fine, but supply could dry up temporarily at some point while they wait for prices to drop. However, if they didn’t plan ahead - expect a high launch price and very little resupply…it might even need to be cancelled or there might need to be a variant offered without RAM included (BYO RAM Edition!). And that’s it! This last bit was the most important part of the article in this writer's opinion – an attempt at helping you avoid getting burned. Well, actually, there is one other important reason for this article’s existence I'll tack onto the end – a hope that other people start digging into what’s going on at OpenAI. I mean seriously – do we even have a single reliable audit of their financials to back up them outrageously spending this much money…for this? Heck, I’ve even heard from numerous sources that OpenAI is “buying up the manufacturing equipment as well” – and without mountains of concrete proof, and/or more input from additional sources on what that really means…I don’t feel I can touch that hot potato without getting burned…but I hope someone else will… Sources: https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/dram/openais-stargate-project-to-consume-up-to-40-percent-of-global-dram-output-inks-deal-with-samsung-and-sk-hynix-to-the-tune-of-up-to-900-000-wafers-per-month https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-and-openai-announce-strategic-partnership-to-accelerate-advancements-in-global-ai-infrastructure https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/ddr5/ai-led-dram-supply-crunch-reportedly-has-morgan-stanley-downgrading-major-oems-skyrocketing-memory-prices-could-erode-server-and-pc-margins https://wccftech.com/dram-prices-have-risen-by-a-whopping-172-this-year-alone/ https://x.com/KobeissiLetter/status/1991255966235419112 https://pcpartpicker.com/product/WTMMnQ/corsair-vengeance-rgb-64-gb-2-x-32-gb-ddr5-6000-cl30-memory-cmh64gx5m2b6000c30?history_days=730 https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-is-knocking-100-off-ps5-consoles-for-black-friday-2025 https://www.reuters.com/technology/samsung-sk-hynix-halt-old-equipment-sales-over-fears-us-backlash-ft-reports-2024-03-12/ https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/samsung-and-sk-hynix-the-worlds-biggest-makers-of-dram-and-flash-memory-chips-have-potentially-lost-the-right-to-buy-us-equipment-for-use-in-their-china-based-factories/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/09/12/news-samsung-reportedly-expands-1c-dram-capacity-for-hbm4-targeting-60k-wafers-monthly-in-2025/ https://www.trendforce.com/news/2025/10/01/news-openai-ceo-reportedly-meets-foxconn-tsmc-heads-to-korea-to-explore-samsung-sk-hynix-ties/?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://www.economist.com/business/2025/11/19/cracks-are-appearing-in-openais-dominant-facade?utm_source=chatgpt.com https://tech4gamers.com/ram-prices-increased/ https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/25/business/trump-tariffs-american-importers.html https://www.economist.com/the-world-ahead/2025/11/12/companies-will-struggle-to-stay-on-top-of-tariff-chaos https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apple-aims-source-all-us-iphones-india-pivot-away-china-ft-reports-2025-04-25/ https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/03/india-us-tariffs-china-trump-foreign-policy.html https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-financial-results-for-third-quarter-fiscal-2024 https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/nvidia-q3-updates-ai-bubble-fears-spotlight-2025-11-19/ https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2025/10/01/seoul-altman-ai-deal-samsung-sk-chips-data-centers/9291759343811/#google_vignette https://www.micron.com/products/memory?srsltid=AfmBOopdnGb80CSI2TU-hbQ6Ei33c2PJ-3ESQuxMk1FZrPrJjUwk8DQI https://www.pcgamesn.com/amd/radeon-rx-9070-gre-16gb-rumor ©2019 by Moore's Law Is Dead.

Title: Layoff Rumors And Metaverse Cuts Push Meta Shares Higher—Details

Time Published: 2025-12-05T23:00:53Z

Meta Platforms Inc. shares climbed after reports that the company is weighing deep reductions to the budget behind its metaverse projects. Investors pushed the stock higher as traders reacted to the possibility that one of the company’s most costly bets could be scaled back. Based on reports from Bloomberg and Reuters, Meta is considering cuts of up to 30% to the unit that builds its virtual reality and metaverse products, a move tied to planning for the company’s 2026 budget. The change would mainly affect Reality Labs, the division that makes Quest headsets and Horizon virtual spaces. Reality Labs has posted heavy losses since 2020. Reports put the total at more than $60 billion and, by some counts, closer to $70 billion in cumulative losses over recent years. Those sums have kept pressure on management to rethink where the company puts its money. The market response was swift. Meta’s share price jumped roughly 4%, and some outlets calculated that the move added about $69 billion to the company’s market value as traders reacted positively to a pullback from costly metaverse spending. That reaction signals investors prefer money steered toward projects with clearer near-term returns. Reports have warned that the cuts could bring staff reductions inside Reality Labs, with layoffs possibly starting as early as January 2026. Company leaders reportedly discussed budget scenarios during recent planning meetings. Any job cuts would mark a sharp change after years of heavy investment in virtual reality and related software. At the same time, Meta has been moving money into artificial intelligence and related hardware. The company finalized a multibillion-dollar deal this year to take a large stake in Scale AI — a pact reported at roughly $14 billion for a near-half ownership — and then hired talent from that startup to help run a new AI effort. That tradeoff shows where Meta’s priorities now lie. For people who own or use Meta’s VR gear, this does not mean every project will end. But several initiatives could see slower progress and smaller teams. For rivals and suppliers in the AR/VR space, the cut may reshape who wins short-term device and platform business. Analysts say the move narrows one major uncertainty for Meta while opening another: how well the company can compete in AI after so many dollars flowed into virtual worlds.

Title: Salesforce CEO Mulls Changing Name to AI-Flavored ‘Agentforce’
URL: https://gizmodo.com/salesforce-ceo-mulls-changing-name-to-ai-flavored-agentforce-2000696360
Time Published: 2025-12-05T22:25:34Z
Full Content:
Reading time 2 minutes Despite the fact that Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff talks about AI nonstop, regularly chimes in on the AI news of the day, and endlessly pushes his company’s AI platform, he seems worried that people just aren’t associating Salesforce with AI. Luckily, he has a solution in mind, according to a report from Business Insider: changing the company’s entire name to Agentforce to evoke the AI agents that he’d like the company to be known for. While the suggestion of changing the company’s name was apparently raised in jest, Benioff took it seriously and told the publication that a new corporate name might be in the works. “That would not shock me,” he reportedly said, with an apparent preference for the name Agentforceâcurrently the name used by a number of the company’s AI-related services, including Agentforce Sales, Agentforce Service, and Agentforce 365 Platform. On one hand, Salesforce Agentforce Sales is pretty redundant, so there’s some logic in simplifying the naming convention. On the other hand, it’s hard not to get a whiff of the cryptocurrency goldrush era, where companies just started throwing the word “blockchain” into everything. Remember when Long Island Iced Tea Corporation changed its name to Long Blockchain Corporation, a name that doesn’t even make sense, and saw its stock immediately skyrocket by over 400%? It feels like we’re not that far off from a situation similar to that. Salesforce, of course, would not be the first tech company to go through a rebrand. Google famously became Alphabet, Jack Dorsey’s Square changed to Block, Elon Musk renamed Twitter to X, and Michael Saylor changed Microstrategy’s moniker to Strategy as it became a bitcoin holding company. Notably, at least two of those are changes most people simply don’t acknowledge. But perhaps the most appropriate parallel for this particular change is Facebook rebranding to Meta in the midst of an effort to pivot the company into a new era where it would become the platform of the metaverse, an immersive virtual reality world where just about anything you could imagine is possible, including having legs. The dream of that particular reality is largely dead now, with Meta reportedlyÂ that it’ll likely have layoffs within its Reality Labs division and will shift away from the virtual world to build more AI products. And yet, the name sticks. That might be a fate Benioff should consider: if you go so far all-in on a single bet that you surrender your name to it, you might just be stuck with a reminder of that decision even if it fails.

Title: CoinEx Research November 2025 Report: Painvember's Brutal Reality Check

Time Published: 2025-12-05T15:01:00Z
Full Content:
December 05, 2025 10:01 ET | Source: CoinEx CoinEx HONG KONG, Dec. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CoinEx Research’s November 2025 Report: Painvember is a brutal reality check after Uptober’s euphoric highs. Profit-taking by long-term holders, sustained ETF outflows, and cascading liquidations drove the downturn, all against a risk-off macro backdrop. While the Fed’s late-month dovish pivot and progress on the Ukraine–Russia peace framework briefly improved liquidity expectations, sentiment deteriorated again due to China reaffirming its crypto ban, S&P Global downgrading USDT, and rising Japanese yields threatening a yen carry-trade unwind. Beyond Bitcoin, AI and prediction-market sectors saw heightened volatility but also meaningful innovation and on-chain activity, while stablecoin flows printed their weakest reading in nearly a year, a key inflection point that may determine whether crypto enters a short-term correction or a new multi-month bear cycle. From Euphoria to Exhaustion: The Toughest Month of 2025 Following a fresh new high in early October, where Bitcoin peaked around $126,000, the momentum of "Uptober" dissipated rapidly, giving way to intense selling pressure throughout November. The asset plunged to a low of $80,500 before closing the month at $90,300, marking a 28% drawdown from its all-time high. This correction was fueled by profit-taking from OG whales, significant outflows from Bitcoin ETFs, and a wave of cascading liquidations, all amplified by a broader risk-off sentiment in the macroeconomic environment. On the macro side, the Federal Reserve shifted toward a more dovish stance late in the month, with market-implied odds of a 25-basis-point rate cut on December 10 climbing to 85%. This development, alongside progress in Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations, offered a glimmer of optimism for improved liquidity conditions in crypto markets. However, sentiment soured toward month-end amid several headwinds: China reaffirmed its stringent crypto ban, S&P Global downgraded Tether's USDT to its lowest "Weak" stability rating, rekindling concerns over stablecoin vulnerabilities, and rising Japanese government bond yields signaled a potential acceleration in the yen carry-trade unwind, pulling liquidity out of risk assets like Bitcoin. In our view, as crypto becomes increasingly institutionalized, macroeconomic factors will play an outsized role in dictating price action. For Bitcoin to avert a deeper bear phase, it must defend the critical $80,000–$82,000 support zone amid ongoing volatility. Key Charts to Watch BTC has remained weak this month, dipping to around $80k before rebounding. However, the overall rebound lacks strength and is highly likely to retest the $80k zone. A break below could lead to a decline toward the next key support at $73k. $ZEC failed to sustain its prior strength and retraced into a demand zone. As a move driven by fundamentals & spot demand, $ZEC’s current cycle may not yet be over—closely monitor price action at the support level. The AI Infrastructure Throne is Shaking In November, the AI sector presented a complex landscape of strong fundamentals yet escalating competition. The chip behemoth NVIDIA delivered better-than-expected earnings, but its stock price experienced significant volatility due to news that Meta plans to shift towards Google TPU chips. This sparked market concern that the monopolistic structure of AI infrastructure might be loosening. On the model front, Google formally released its flagship model, Gemini 3 Pro, boasting a 1M token context window and powerful multimodal capabilities, solidifying its position in the model arms race. Notably, China's Moonshot AI Lab also launched its kimi-k2-thinking model this month. This model, which utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, achieves high-performance inference at extremely low training costs. This marks an intensification of the global open-source AI model competition, providing the decentralized AI community with a new low-cost, high-efficiency model option. AI Bubble FUD Spills Over The volatility in the stock prices and valuations of AI giants directly impacted the cryptocurrency market through the risk sentiment transmission chain. As high-beta core assets of the US tech sector, the short-term correction in AI concept stocks triggered a broader sell-off in "Risk-On Assets." This stock-crypto market linkage was prominent in November: the decline of market leaders like NVIDIA heightened fears of an AI bubble, subsequently leading to selling pressure on the crypto market near critical price points. Crypto AI Projects also Cooking The cryptocurrency AI track remained highly active and innovative in November. Infrastructure leader Bittensor (TAO) continued to expand its subnet ecosystem and attracted institutional capital through an ETP listing in the European market, with market focus shifting to its first halving mechanism in December. In terms of compute power, Render (RNDR) officially launched its Compute Subnet, transitioning into a pure AI inference computing network. The application and agent layers saw real-world stress testing: nof1.ai's Alpha Arena Season 1.5 commenced, deploying $320,000 in real capital, pitting multiple AI models, including Gemini 3 Pro and kimi-k2-thinking, against each other in real-time cryptocurrency and US stock token trading on the Hyperliquid DEX, directly placing the AI models' investment judgment capabilities in a competitive arena. Prediction Markets Enter Normalized High-Liquidity Era The prediction market’s weekly volume exceeded $3.6 billion in November, significantly surpassing the 2024 election peak. In our view, the market has successfully transitioned from an "event-driven" model to a phase of "normalized high liquidity." Polymarket maintains its stable retail user base, while Kalshi, leveraging compliance and institutional capital, has caught up to and, in periods, overtaken Polymarket in transaction volume. The Monad-based Opinion protocol surged in Q4, rapidly capturing a significant market share and challenging the established duopoly. Polymarket Builders Ecosystem: High Concentration & Strategic Value Extreme Volume Concentration: The Builders program has created a highly concentrated structure, with Betmoar dominating the ecosystem by capturing an astonishing 68.49% of all third-party front-end transaction volume. This highlights an "extreme head effect" driven by superior UX or specific incentives. Tier 2 Differentiation: The second tier, led by Standtrade (9.8%) and Polytraderpro (7.77%), proves that specialized interfaces (e.g., Pro tools for traders) still hold significant volume and room for differentiated competition. Strategic Long Tail: The remaining volume (~14%) is held by long-tail projects (like Polycule and Matchr.xyz). Though small, these independent front-ends are critical to Polymarket's overall censorship resistance and global market penetration. Stablecoin Flows Just Printed the Most Bearish Bar in a Year Stablecoin inflows have slowed significantly, with the next period's data being extremely critical. This month, stablecoins continued to see inflows, but the volume has slowed markedly, reaching the lowest level ($1.9B) in nearly a year. The next period's data is highly critical and could lead to two possible scenarios: Economic Data & Events to Watch in December 2025 About CoinEx Established in 2017, CoinEx is an award-winning cryptocurrency exchange designed with users in mind.

Title: Report: Meta planning massive cuts to Reality Labs metaverse division

Time Published: 2025-12-05T13:01:58Z

Company expected to redirect investment to augmented reality glasses Tech giant Meta is reportedly looking to make cuts in its Reality Labs metaverse division, the home of the Quest VR headest and the Horizon Worlds platform. That's according to Bloomberg, which reports that execs at the company are eying up budget reductions of as much as 30% during 2026. Layoffs might be take place as early as January. The company is planning cuts across the board, but more extensively to the metaverse division because it has not seen significant competition in the space, according to sources speaking to Bloomberg. Investors and analysts have been demanding the company reduce its heavily lossmaking investments in the sector, which run at billions of dollars per quarter. The firm is reportedly not looking to abandon its metaverse plans, but is moving the money it is saving with these cuts into its augmented reality glasses, currently produced in partnership with Ray-Ban, according to additional reporting by the New York Times. “Within our overall Reality Labs portfolio, we are shifting some of our investment from Metaverse towards AI glasses and wearables, given the momentum there. We aren’t planning any broader changes than that,” a Meta spokesperson told the FT. Following the Bloomberg report, the company's stock shot up 5.5% when the markets opened on Thursday morning, suggesting investor approval for the changes. Meta's share price ended the day 3.4% higher. In February 2025, Meta disclosed that despite its Meta Quest hardware yielding $1.08 billion in revenue, the Reality Labs division recorded a $4.97 billion loss. This part of the company has been in the red for much of its existence and lost over $70 billion since the company pivoted to focus on the metaverse. For the three months ending September 30, 2025, Meta reported a $4.4 billion operational loss – largely in line with the previous year's figures – while for the nine months ending September 30th, this loss comes to $13.2 billion, a 3% increase year-on-year. Meta CFO Susan Li told investors that the company expected lower Reality Labs revenue for its Q4, which ends on December 30, 2025. Facebook rebranded as Meta Platforms back in 2021, such was Zuckerburg and co.'s conviction that the metaverse was the future of digital communication. Despite Meta's more recent focus on AI, the company announced last month that it was cutting 600 jobs from its Superintelligence Labs division. The cuts would be the latest in a series of significant job losses at the company. In January of this year, Meta cut 5% of its workforce, estimated to be around 3,600 staff, while in 2023, it laid off 10,000 workers and retired 5,000 open roles.

Oracle debt is spiraling toward 2008-era danger, with five-year CDS jumping to 125 bps and possibly hitting 200 bps in 2026 as AI spending soars. Oracle’s debt has surged to $104 billion in FY2025 and may hit $290 billion by FY2028 as free cash flow turns negative for the first time since 1999. Ratings outlook is now negative. Other hyperscalers remain stronger with large cash reserves. AI capex is rising fast to $600 billion by 2027, intensifying credit risks.

Title: Are retail investors trying to tell us something about Apple?

Every time Joe publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. As an avid Apple Music user, I felt left out on Spotify Wrapped Day earlier this week. Most of my Spotify-using friends and coworkers gleefully swapped musical tastes all day long as I sat on the outside. "But Apple has an intuitive interface and superior audio quality," I mumbled into my coffee, to no one in particular. As it turns out, retail investors have been similarly treating Apple like an afterthought. During the shortened Thanksgiving week, they piled into every Magnificent 7 stock but Apple, pulling $96 million out, according to JPMorgan data. (For context, Nvidia led inflows with $650 million.) What's more, JPMorgan found that day traders have been consistent sellers of Apple throughout the year. This matches data from Schwab showing that its clients were net sellers of Apple during the third quarter. The reason is relatively straightforward to anyone who's followed the AI race this year: Apple is behind — or at least that's the perception investors have. While fellow contestants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Meta loudly pile tens of billions of dollars into AI and ink huge deals with one another, Apple has been its typically quiet self. The secrecy and painstaking caution that helped the company create and mass-manufacture some of the world's most ubiquitous consumer products is now viewed as a drawback. Apple's competitors are growing more aggressive, and it's struggling to match that energy. Reflective of cooling retail interest is middling stock performance for Apple, especially by its high standards. It's up 12% year to date, trailing the S&P 500 by almost five percentage points. This is a company that's exceeded a 30% annual return in five of the last six years! And it's not just retail investors getting cold feet about Apple. Berkshire Hathaway has trimmed its holding in the company by two-thirds from its peak position (although the stock remains Berkshire's top holding by value). Viking Global went as far as to offload its entire stake in the fourth quarter of last year. As for how it's going at Apple right now, it's hard to ignore the exit of the company's AI chief. Sure, there's a talent war raging in the industry, but Apple has more cash on hand than most small nations. If it wanted to pay up to keep key people, it could. It also doesn't help that criticism is coming from high places. A co-creator of the tech behind Siri recently said it was a misstep to make the AI agent voice-only. Still, I'd stop short of breaking out the violins for Apple. It remains an undeniable juggernaut. But it does have newly resurgent Alphabet nipping at its heels, and Microsoft isn't far behind. It could soon lose its spot as the second-most-valuable company. Ultimately, there's a difference between being a mega-profitable behemoth and also having your stock price trounce peers and go straight up forever. Apple eventually might have to settle for the former. Jump to

Title: Reddit's CEO says the platform is ditching a key part that 'sucks'

Every time Aditi publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Reddit is getting rid of one of its oldest fixtures. The platform's CEO, Steve Huffman, said in a post that Reddit would be removing its r/popular feed from the homepage for new users to promote a more personalized and relevant user experience. The popular feed, located on the left sidebar of the website, displays the most liked recent posts across the platform. "In theory, it's what's most popular on Reddit, but it's actually what is liked by the most active users on Reddit—which is not the same thing," he said. "Having it as a default feed gives the false impression of a singular Reddit culture, one that is neither representative of Reddit nor appealing to new users (or anyone at all, IMO)." He summed up his disdain for the feature by saying, "r/popular sucks, and we're moving away from it, and towards better, more relevant and personalized feeds." Huffman, who has been the platform's CEO since 2015, said Reddit would stop showing the popular feed in the sidebar unless users read it regularly. He said his favorite part of Reddit was that every community on the platform had its own unique culture, rules, and sense of humor. "And if your perspective isn't represented, you can create the community you want to see," he said. "The freedom to build your own corner of the internet is what makes Reddit, Reddit." The platform gets 116 million visitors daily, he said. Reddit's stock price has risen about 44% in the past year. In the post, he announced a few other changes, like limiting the number of high-traffic communities a single person can moderate, and changing the way it shows community sizes. "These changes are all part of the same goal: making Reddit more conducive to how people actually use it today," he said. This is not Reddit's first effort to nudge its users into smaller community groups, as it recalibrates its platform alongside competitors like Quora, and beyond that, the likes of Meta. In October, Reddit removed its public chat feature and urged users to chat on private group chats as a way to "connect with communities in smaller, focused spaces." Jump to
