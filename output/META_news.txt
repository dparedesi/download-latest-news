Medical intervention is not always necessary, but it’s important to educate ourselves on what to expect so that we can make informed decisions throughout the transition. Due to the recent ’re-awakening’ of menopause in social media, there are many conflicting and confusing views on menopause and how to manage symptoms. This Menopause Wiki provides a balanced introduction so that you can arm yourself with knowledge, and feel empowered to take charge of your own journey. Doctors recommend checking with your mother as an indicator of what to expect, but this may not be an accurate gauge; your experience might be more in line with sisters instead. Similarities shared during upbringing and exposure to the same lifestyle/environment are better predictors of how you might experience symptoms, but the age at which your mother reached menopause may be more similar to yours. Either way, asking the women in your family could help to plan ahead. Some women breeze through the menopause transition with few or no symptoms, while others experience debilitating symptoms for a decade or longer; most fall somewhere in-between. Therapies that work for some women may not work at all for you. The transition is often described as “reverse puberty” and this seems most apt. Our mothers/aunts/grandmas rarely discussed their menopause, likely because older generations felt it was largely taboo to discuss ‘delicate’ women’s issues. Others simply didn’t associate many of the common symptoms to hormonal changes, or their brain fog made them forget entirely! This knowledge gap has lead to a new generation of women who know little-to-nothing about this major life change. Almost everyone relates menopause to two things: (1) hot flashes and (2) periods ending, freedom from all the mess and pregnancy worry, when in fact one of the most common symptoms of menopause (and rarely heard of) is “atrophic vaginitis”, the thinning, drying and shrinking of the vagina…horrifying right?! For many coming into perimenopause (the time before menopause), we first notice subtle changes in our cycles, in our bodies and moods, but have no idea what is going on; we aren’t ready! This is why it is so important we talk about menopause, not only for those of us experiencing it, but also for the next generation of women who are worried and confused about what’s happening to their bodies and are too afraid to seek help. Collectively we can move beyond the realizations that we’re not crazy, or worse, dying, and seek help without barriers. Most medical professionals are woefully inadequate in recognizing menopause, and even less equipped in offering advice or treatment options. In fact, only a small fraction of doctors receive any formal training in menopause medicine, and even then it’s only a brief chapter in medical school; some gynecologists even struggle to identify menopause. Due to this lack of training and knowledge, less than 15% of women receive effective treatment for their symptoms. Doctors are quick to prescribe antidepressants and pain medication for what sounds like depression/anxiety and ’normal aging’ aches and pains, but rarely make the connection to hormones. Doctors can be very dismissive when presented with symptoms so it is important to know what you want and be persistent. Despite the extra effort (and learning curve), it is up to us to arm ourselves with knowledge â read research, form a network (talk to your friends and relatives), and know that when you enter perimenopause, you are not crazy and you are certainly not alone! Perimenopause occurs between the ages of 40-50 (can be earlier) and is the time leading up to menopause. The average length of this stage is anywhere between 4 and 10 years (longer for some). Hormones (estrogen, progesterone and testosterone) wildly fluctuate and physical changes occur, including the length of time between periods. The perimenopause transition occurs over a number of years in two phases (1) the early phase and (2) the late phase. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. As well as irregular periods, this is also a time when women might feel ‘off’ or experience subtle changes like general aches, pains, and mood fluctuations. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. Since everyone is different, there is no definitive timeline of when symptoms occur, or when periods stop. In fact, perimenopause is often discovered in hindsight and over time. Pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause. As hormones continue to decrease women can experience one or more of the symptoms listed below. Perimenopause ends one year after the final menstrual period. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker events” and soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. Is this perimenopause? can help you narrow it down. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when one full year (12 months) has passed without a period (not using hormonal contraception). According to meta-analyses of global data (2024), the mean age of reaching menopause (aka post-menopause) is 48.8 years (Europe is 51), but typically it can be between the ages of 45 and 55. Map outlining the age of menopause by country for 2025. Early (non-surgical) menopause, before the age of 45, is often influenced by other factors, such as social class, mother’s smoking, and those who smoked in childhood and early adulthood and early menopause carries other risk factors. In menopause, ovaries have stopped producing estrogen, or only produce a very small amount. Around this time testosterone slows, resulting in decreased sex drive. Menopause is diagnosed retrospectively, when a woman has had no periods for one year or more, typically it is acknowledged on the one day…the day after 12 months without a period. Once menopausal, there is no magic “yay” moment where all other symptoms stop too and life goes back to normal. In fact, many women continue to experience all the same symptoms as before (just without periods), and these symptoms can carry on for years or even decades beyond that last period. Even if symptoms resolve around this time, we still may feel different physically and mentally. Note: If spotting occurs when nearing that 12 month mark, the clock resets back to one month and the count starts all over again - which does happen and is very frustrating. Also if any bleeding occurs after 12 months of not having a period, you must see your doctor to have tests done. Any bleeding beyond the 12 months is not normal and should be investigated. Occurs at any age when a woman’s ovaries are removed or badly damaged due to a medical treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation. When hormone-producing ovaries are removed, women are thrown into immediate menopause, which is a shock to the body and can be very debilitating and may have permanent, significant repercussions on health if not treated. This is especially true if ovary removal occurs before the age of 45 (which is classified as early menopause) as it carries higher risks for osteoporosis, heart disease, and dementia. When a woman has a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and/or cervix), she sometimes has her ovaries removed as well, and sometimes not. In cases where one or both ovaries are retained, the woman will most likely continue to have ovarian function and not be menopausal, though in some cases, the shock of the surgery might hasten menopausal changes. In women who have had a hysterectomy, they cannot rely on vaginal bleeding patterns to assess menopausal status, so testing FSH levels may be helpful. There is no definitive blood test to diagnose menopause, but repeated hormonal tests over a period of time may provide some insight. Occurs usually between the ages of 45-60 when more than one year has passed without a period. This is also the same day as reaching ‘menopause’ (above). Despite no longer having periods, we can continue to experience varying degrees of symptoms beyond that last period. Even in post-menopause, our ovaries still produce very small amounts of estrogen but not enough for pregnancy to occur. While hormonal swings settle down and some symptoms may improve, post-menopausal women are now faced with increased risk for diseases, particularly heart disease, osteoporosis (bone loss) and dementia to name a few. The average age of becoming menopausal (aka post-menopausal) is 48-51 years old, and because of increased life expectancy, women can expect to spend approximately 30-50% of their lives in a post-menopausal state. It is estimated that this year (2025) more than one billion women globally will be in perimenopause or post-menopause. Note: any post-menopausal bleeding/spotting is not normal and should be evaluated by your doctor. Oftentimes it can be just one last spike in hormones, or due to vaginal atrophy/tearing. Doctors should suggest a pap, pelvic ultrasound, and perhaps uterine biopsy to rule out other potential issues. Peri/menopause is diagnosed by SYMPTOMS, or rather the process of eliminating those symptoms as being due to something else. (It is not diagnosed through follicle-stimulating hormone blood or saliva testing). The following symptoms are directly attributed to fluctuating and declining hormones, particularly estrogen. Symptoms come and go at any time between perimenopause and well into post-menopause, affecting women for years long after periods have stopped. Symptoms may improve and disappear entirely, while new ones crop up and/or become worse. Unfortunately there is no limit of how long symptoms will last, it is different for everyone. For some, symptoms continue for decades, for others they simply stop, and for many others, symptoms can be mild, temporary, and very manageable without any intervention. Menopause symptoms can mimic other ailments/diseases, and this is why it’s very important to track symptoms using an app (like a period tracker) to see trends and cyclical activities over a period of time. This information can then be shared with doctors to help rule out anything else that might be going on. Due to hormonal swings, existing conditions can also be further aggravated/worsened, such as increased IBS/GERD flare-ups, increased susceptibility to osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid arthritis, (inflammatory diseases) increased skin irritations, and generally the overall weakening of our immune systems, opening the door to other medical issues. The Impact of Estrogens and Their Receptors on Immunity and Inflammation during Infection The first step with any new or unusual symptom is to visit a doctor. Check our Menopause Provider Directory which contains searchable links to find a menopause practitioner near you. There are a wide array of options to both alleviate symptoms and to also provide long-term health benefits as we age. Symptoms include, but are not limited to: It is important to note that symptoms could also be associated to normal aging, and/or previous/existing or new medical conditions, and/or other medications/herbals remedies, and/or nutrient deficiencies. Therefore, before assuming your symptoms are hormone-related, it is crucial to rule out any new and peristent symptom as being due to something else. Note: While hormone therapy can help with many symptoms listed above (particularly hot flashes/night sweats, vaginal atrophy, irritability, low sex drive, etc), it is not meant to eliminate all things-all the time. Menopause hormone therapy (MHT) can help to improve quality of life overall, but we also need to take charge of our health by incorporating several methods, such as making lifestyle changes (be the healthiest you can be) and using other medications or interventions. Atrophic vaginitis (vaginal atrophy) is the drying and thinning of vulva and vagina due to declining estrogen, and is one of the most common symptoms of perimenopause/menopause, experienced by approximately 60-70% of post-menopausal women. Yet we only expect hot flashes, not the burning, shrinking, drying of our vaginal tissues. The genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) is one of the most alarming and discouraging events to experience during peri/menopause, greatly affecting our self-esteem and quality of life. According to The Women’s EMPOWER Survey, of the 1,858 women, 81% were not aware of this condition, and 72% never discussed their symptoms with a health care professional because they thought it was just “normal aging” and “something to live with”. Even more shocking, those that disclosed their symptoms to doctors found that the clinician did not initiate the discussion, and most clinicians only offered lube (gels/creams) as treatment, and not vaginal estrogen. A separate, but similar issue is clitoral atrophy (urogenital atrophy) is when the clitoris loses sensitivity and shrinks/disappears. Both GSM and clitoral atrophy are commonly due to the reduction in estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. The good news is that both are highly treatable and reversible. The sooner treatment is started, the better the long-term outcome. Other concerns involve urology issues. Specifically the urethra tissue is coated in androgen receptors and when these receptors stop receiving sex hormones (from estrogen), they begin to collapse on themselves, preventing normal emptying of the urethra, therefore increasing risk for bacterial infections (yeast, UTIs). As well a changes to the vagina area, sexual and/or urinary issues, there are other common urologic conditions which make diagnosis difficult, and research is seriously lacking (big surprise!). However, the American Urological Association recently released their 2025 Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) Guidelines, which provides information to clinicians to help diagnose, counsel and treat patients. Specifically they advise that “clinicians should offer the option of a low-dose vaginal estrogen to patients with GSM to improve vulvovaginal discomfort/irritation, dryness, and/or dyspareunia”. (print this document and bring it with you to your medical appointments) It is important for everyone entering perimenopause (typically 40+, or earlier) to consider using localized vaginal estrogen as part of their regular routines to ensure vaginal/urinary health. Without ongoing and consistent treatment, GSM (atrophy) will not resolve on its own and can present more serious issues later on. This is not just about the ability to have comfortable intercourse, but also about our vulvovaginal/urinary health, self-esteem and ultimately, quality of life. Symptoms of vaginal atrophy: Symptoms of clitoral atrophy: These issues can have a significant impact on sexual function (reduced libido, orgasm). However, the good news is that these issues can be treated, reversed and prevented with vaginal estrogen or with other approved treatments. It is important to note that interstitial cystitis (IC) shares some symptoms of vaginal atrophy (along with other conditions) which makes it extremely difficult to diagnose. IC is a chronic bladder condition involving pelvic pain and urinary changes. Estrogen loss affects bladder, urethra, and vulva tissues, making them more fragile and susceptible to irritation and infection which may contribute to interstitial cystitis. Starting treatment earlier for vaginal atrophy (GSM), may help prevent risk of IC. According to the American Urological Association, their 2025 Guidelines indicate that: Estrogen binds to receptors in the vagina, vulva, urethra, bladder, and pelvic floor, shifts the vaginal cytology toward superficial cells, away from parabasal cells, and reduces the vaginal pH. Vaginal moisturizers increase the fluid content in the endothelium and reduce the vaginal pH. Personal lubricants can be water, silicone, or oil-based and are primarily used to provide short-term lubrication during sexual activity; lubricants are often used as a placebo or control treatment in clinical trials. Newer hormonal approaches include vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), vaginal oxytocin, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), and testosterone. DHEA is a precursor to both androgens and estrogens that is transformed into estradiol and testosterone within vaginal cells. Oxytocin is a pituitary hormone primarily implicated in uterine labor contractions and lactation, but vaginal oxytocin gel has also been shown to reduce vaginal pH and increase the proportion of superficial cells in small studies. These treatments are outlined in more detail below. Vaginal low-dose localized estrogen is the “gold standard” treatment for GSM/vaginal atrophy, it is well-tolerated by most and quite safe for many, no matter what age. Localized estrogen comes in vaginal tablets (such as Vagifem, Imvexxy, etc), vaginal cream (such as Estrace, Premarin, etc), or vaginal ring (Estring) are prescription medications that are inserted or applied directly into the vagina. Generally the tablets and cream are used every day for two weeks, and then twice weekly after that for the reversal and prevention of atrophy. The vaginal ring stays in your vagina for three months and then is removed/replaced every 3 months. There are no known increased risks in using these methods as they are low dose estrogen localized to the vagina only. (Because the estrogen is such a low dose, it is not necessary to take progesterone.) A retrospective review of 5600 women, found that vaginal estrogen decreased urinary track infection by more than 50%. Localized estriol is a weak estrogen and the one that supports pregnancy, however it binds well to vaginal tissues, so it is shown to be effective (like estradiol) when using for GSM. (Estriol is not used in FDA-approved systemic hormone therapy.) Localized vaginal estrogen is very safe and should be prescribed for anyone over the age of 40 (or even earlier) as a preventative treatment to ensure urinary/bladder and vaginal health as we age. Some prefer vaginal tablets which can be inserted high into the vaginal canal, and dissolve slowly over time, while others prefer vaginal creams, which can be applied in the vaginal opening, over the clitoris, urethra, inner labia, etc. Creams tend to be messier for this reason and can more easily transfer to clothing/underwear. However, both methods (tablets or creams) are effective and it comes down to personal preference. Vaginal estrogen and breast cancer. The 2025 American Urological Association guideline statements #19-#21 indicates that “while there are no data stratifying the risk for breast cancer in users of local low-dose vaginal estrogen who have an above average or high risk for breast cancer, data suggest that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for recurrence or of breast cancer mortality in women with a personal history of breast cancer.” Also, those “with a personal history of breast cancer are at high risk for developing GSM, sexual dysfunction, and issues with vaginal health. Endocrine therapies, including tamoxifen and AI, are an important component of the treatment on estrogen-dependent breast cancers, which make up 80% of all breast cancers. Because these therapies lower estrogen levels, the symptoms of GSM in breast cancer patients are more magnified.” An analysis of data on 49,237 women with breast cancer from two national registries in Scotland and Wales showed no increase in cancer-specific mortality was seen among women in the cohort who used vaginal estrogen. In a 2024 systematic review and metanalysis, which included eight observational studies of breast cancer survivors with GSM, there was no increased risk for breast cancer recurrence (OR: 0.48; n=24,060) in users of vaginal estrogen, nor was there an increase in breast cancer mortality (OR: 0.60; n=61695), or overall mortality. According to the Breast Cancer Org, vaginal estrogen is safe for women with breast cancer, indicating that research found vaginal estrogen didn’t increase the risk of dying from breast cancer. Studies show that localized estrogen therapy eliminates the symptoms of vaginal atrophy in 80%â90% of cases, while systemic MHT does so in 75% of cases. However, because low dose vaginal estrogen is applied directly to affected tissues, many use both localized and systemic estrogen at the same time for an added boost. The table below outlines FDA-approved treatments and dosages for GSM from the American Urological Association’s Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause - Guideline Statement 8 (Hormonal interventions): Tips for applying vaginal estrogen cream: (provided by pelvic floor therapist, u/FritaBurgerhead) The inserts/medication guides found within vaginal estrogen packaging contain long,detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers associated to estrogen. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study, when estrogen was identified as increasing risks, this warning had to be applied to ALL estrogens in any form. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off using vaginal estrogen. The estrogen warnings, according to Dr. Jen Gunter: This (estrogen warning) does not apply in ANY way to vaginal estrogen. There are no studies that have actually linked any health concerns with vaginal estrogen. Everybody can use it and there’s really just one exception…is if you’ve got a cancer, or have had a cancer that is estrogen receptor dependent, or estrogen dependent, and in that situation, talk to your doctor first.

According to a study of 178 post-menopausal women, 52% experienced female pattern hair loss (FPHL). More recent statistics indicate that by age 60, an estimated 80% of women experience hair loss. Hair loss occurs due to hormone fluctuations, particularly from the loss of estrogen and progesterone. In menopause (and also due to aging) hair becomes thinner resulting is the hair follicle shrinking, causing it to fall out. However, there are also many other factors associated to hair loss, such as genetics, low iron levels, thyroid issues, other nutrient deficiencies, stress, medications, autoimmune issues, and even some birth control. There is not a lot of research on how estrogen affects hair, but one study found that estrogen receptors are present in hair follicles, indicating that perhaps declining estrogen affects hair loss. Hair loss is not associated to colouring your hair or shampooing it too much, but certain hair styles that pull on the roots (ponytails, braids, etc) can damage hair follicles resulting in hair loss. Symptoms of hair loss: …biotin in patient samples can cause falsely high or falsely low results, depending on the type of test, the FDA is particularly concerned about biotin interference causing a falsely low result for troponin, a clinically important biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of heart attacks, which may lead to a missed diagnosis and potentially serious clinical implications Further reading for hair loss: Vasomotor Symptoms (VSM) or hot flashes/flushes affect approximately 80% of women during the menopause transition with the median duration of 8-10 years (meaning half will experience VSM longer than 8-10 years). However, some lucky few never experience them. Hot flashes are essentially the same as night sweats, except night sweats occur at night (go figure). Night sweats are a common first symptom, because estrogen levels are lowest at night. However, those who experience hot flashes during the day may not have any night sweats. Hot flashes are uniquely experienced, so much so that many of us have no idea how to accurately describe or define them. Following is a sampling of how our users describe their hot flashes …. “sort of like a whoosh”, “increased palpitations”, “more headachy”, “uncontrolled sweating from every pore”, “anxious”, “sense of dread in the pit of my stomach”, “sweating only on arms”, “sweating only on feet”, “drenched in sweat”, “lasts only a few minutes”, “lasts for hours”, “cold sweats”, “shivering”, “hot, then cold, then hot”, “swamp crotch”, “internal fire”, “prickly hot” “accompanied with nausea”, “like having a bad sunburn”, “radiating heat”, “sweating in places never before”, “like an electrical jolt”, “like a panic attack”, “like a sudden rash”, “suddenly start/stop”, “occur the same time every night” “everytime I drink alcohol I get a hot flash”, “hot all the time”, “hot only at certain times of the day”, “dripping sweat, but then cold chills”, “sweaty mess!”, “swampy, steamy and sour” …. As an added bonus, our reaction to the hot flash contributes to even more heart palpitations/racing and stress! Hot flashes may also be triggered by alcohol/caffeine/sugar use, smoking, obesity and other stressors. Research indicates that hot flashes are related to decreased estrogen levels which causes our body’s thermostat (hypothalamus) to become more sensitive to small changes in body temperature. When our brain thinks we are too warm, a hot flash occurs to cool us down. As outlined by Dr. Jen Gunter (author of The Menopause Manifesto) in her Vajenda article: With a hot flash, you aren’t feeling hot because your body temperature is rising, what is happening is that you are receiving an incorrect chemical signal that it is! Basically, the call is coming from inside the house. Meaning, your brain has assembled a message of excess heat because it received a signal from the KNDy neurons, and now as far as your brain is concerned (which is all that matters), you are hot and so you feel hot. … …Skin is hot with hot flash because the brain, mistakenly thinking you are hot, starts to deploy the mechanisms to cool down. This involves dilating blood vessels and shunting blood to the skin so you can dump body heat from blood. This is also why many people sweat during a hot flush. Because core temperature was never elevated, body temperature can actually drop after a hot flash because the body has deployed mechanisms to cool off. This is why some people feel cold and shiver after a hot flash. Hot flashes/night sweats can continue for many years (7-9 years according to Dr. Jen Gunter) but some continue to experience hot flashes long into post-meno and into their 70’s or 80s. According to Harvard Health, studies indicate that 30% of women still had hot flashes 10 to 19 years after menopause, and 20% had hot flashes more than 20 years after menopause. The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), which included 1449 women, found that frequent hot flashes lasted more than 7 years for more than half of the women. Hot flashes/night sweats also contribute to chronic sleep deprivation which affects our long-term health so it’s important to seek treatment to improve sleep quality. Recent research indicates that frequent and persistent hot flashes/night sweats can increase risks for cardiovascular disease and dementia: For those that cannot do MHT or choose not to, the following are non-hormonal pharmaceutical treatments: The following non-pharmaceutical options may also be effective with varying results: Hot flashes (night sweats) are one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved treatment by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Systemic menopause hormone therapy (aka HRT) (travels throughout the body) consists of estrogen and progesterone (if you have a uterus). MHT is the gold standard for treating hot flashes and, if on the correct dosage, can improve or eliminate hot flashes/night sweats entirely. For some, that change can be almost immediate or it may take a few weeks to notice results. Further reading for hot flash/night sweats: Further studies/articles on herbals, soy/phytoestrogens, and menopause supplements: Here comes reverse puberty! Any unusual change in menstruation should be discussed with your doctor, but if you are in the perimenopausal age range of (40-50), irregular bleeding should not be immediate cause for concern. However, if bleeding is persistent, over a longer period of time, unusually heavy, and/or causing pain then it’s important to see a doctor. (fibroids, cysts, polyps are common contributors) Irregular periods are another common early symptom of perimenopause, and for those who have been extremely regular most of their reproductive life, the disruption can be very alarming. We often associate regularity with optimum health, and when we skip a period or have two in one month, it comes as quite a shock. We assume our periods will get further apart, not closer together! If only we were informed and expected irregular bleeding as part of the normal menopausal transition, it wouldn’t fill us with unnecessary grief, worry or fear. Irregular periods are defined as missed periods, longer/shorter,closer together/further apart, heavier/lighter, flooding, spotting, clotting, and/or dark/different coloured blood. Tracking periods becomes an important tool as it helps to identify patterns and anomalies which is helpful to doctors as well. Everything we know about period predictability goes out in the window in perimenopause, but it should not be cause for alarm. Note: Periods can become quite heavy in perimenopause, these are often called “super-soaker” events, where soaking through two pads an hour for two hours requires medical investigation. According to Dr. Jen Gunter, Heavy Periods are Really Common in Perimenopause, but it’s important to be aware of ‘super-soaker’ events where any of the following are considered “heavy”: A study analyzed the bleeding patterns of 1,320 women during the menopause transition found that 77.7% had periods lasting 10+ days and 35% had heavy bleeding for 3+ days. The early phase of perimenopause often involves changes in cycles, where they are lengthened by seven or more days. Progesterone is usually the first hormone to drop, causing these irregular periods (heavier, lighter) and skipped periods. The late phase of perimenopause is characterized by more skipped periods (>60 days between periods). According to Dr. Jen Gunter, “when a women starts skipping two menstrual periods in a row, there is a 95% chance her final menstrual period will be within the next four years”, but this is only a rough guideline. So, what can be done about irregular bleeding? Further reading about irregular periods: A 2024 comprehensive study (comprised of 482,067 middle-aged women) found that joint and muscular pain were the most common symptoms of menopause, experienced by 65%. However, aches and pains also increase with age, so it can be difficult to determine what is associated to declining estrogen and what is “normal aging”. Estrogen plays a significant role in our muscles, joints, bones and connective tissues. According to the Effect of Estrogen on Musculoskeletal Performance and Injury Risk “estrogen receptors are present in all musculoskeletal tissues, including muscle, bone, and tendon”, and estrogen also plays a role in pain modulation. When our estrogen fluctuates and ultimately declines, we experience new and unusual pain which can lead to chronic issues in post-menopause. Pain during peri/menopause occurs randomly and can come and go making diagnosis difficult. It’s best to track symptoms to determine if they coincide with your own cycles, and/or are affected by stress/anxiety, lack of sleep, exercise, etc. It is important to rule out symptoms as being due to something else, like osteoarthritis, RA, autoimmune disease, etc, therefore diagnosis may involve x-rays, blood tests for mineral/vitamin deficiences, etc. Further reading on joint and muscular pain: A silent symptom of menopause Menopause significantly accelerates bone loss due to declining estrogen; we can lose as much as 20% of bone within the first five years of becoming menopausal. According to the 2022 Endocrine Society, “one in two postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a fracture during their lifetime”. Osteopenia is commonly a precurser to osteoporosis; it is a loss of bone mineral density (BMD) which weakens bones. Whereas, osteoporosis is more severe as bones become brittle and easily break. However, not everyone who has osteopenia will develop osteoporosis. Risk factors include: Symptoms are subtle, we may not feel or notice anything: Diagnosis involves measuring bone density through a duel-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. The scan is quick and painless and uses a low dose radiation. Doctors do not recommend this test until the age of 65, which may be too late. Since bone loss rapidly occurs once we become menopausal, testing should be performed shortly after becoming post-menopausal - no matter what age. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends that scans be performed as early as age 50. The test reveals a “T Score” as follows: Calculate your Fracture Risk for probability of fracture over the next ten years. The first step in prevention is making healthy lifestyle changes, including: Bone loss is one of the four symptoms which hormone therapy is an approved prevention by the FDA (see the Menopause Society’s 2022 Position Statement on Hormone Therapy). Hormone therapy is the most effective for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, reducing risk of hip fractures by 30-50%. A study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT (due to the WHI 2002 study), there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Even low dosage transdermal estradiol can improve bone mineral density in post-menopause. This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 417 post-menopausal women found that even an ultra-low dosage of transdermal estrogen (0.014 mg) can increase lumbar spine mineral density. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. For those who cannot do MHT (or choose not to), there are other non-hormonal options available; speak to your doctor. Pharmaceutical treatment options include bisphosphonates and denosumab and SERMS. We can also reduce risk and prevent further loss by doing weight bearing and resistance exercises, which forces us to work against gravity. These include walking, hiking, jogging, climbing stairs, playing tennis, dancing, jumping, using hand-weights, resistance bands, machines, and our own body weight. Researchers from Australia were the first to demonstrate that post-menopausal women can not only stop bone density loss, but a can actually reverse it by lifting heavy weight. Prior to this, studies showed that lifting weights did not work to stop or reverse osteoporosis. These researchers later discovered it was because the women test subjects weren’t lifting heavy enough. Researchers worried that if post-menopausal women with severe osteoporosis lifted weights that are too heavy, they would fracture their bones. However, since that time, their Lifting Intervention for Training Muscle and Osteoporosis Rehabilitation (LIFTMOR) trial determined that twice-weekly, 30-minute high-intensity resistance and impact training (HiRIT) is effective at enhancing bone (particularly in the spine, pelvis and thigh bones), while improving stature and fall prevention. Another consideration is that between the ages of 50 and 70, we lose about 30% of our muscle strength, putting us at risk for falls. We can help minimize this risk by building more muscle mass, but also practising balance every day which helps strengthen our core and prevent falls. Balancing can be done anytime throughout the day; it’s a simple as standing one leg. (for more links to specific exercises, see our Fitness Wiki) Further reading for osteoporosis: Approximately 70% of women experience mood swings, but this term seriously underestimates the impact estrogen has on our brains. As with most of our bodies, estrogen receptors are found in our brains, particularly in the areas that regulate mood and congition. Drs. Mosconi and Brinton recently discovered “the density of estrogen receptors in women’s brains increases significantly over the menopause transition” and that “this increase was associated with memory lapses, mood swings, and lower scores on some cognitive tests in post-menopausal women”. (Menopause Brain is Real) Therefore ‘mood swings’ encompasses many things, including anxiety, depression, anger, sadness, intolerance to situations/people, irritability, loss of self-esteem/confidence, social withdrawal, loss of apathy, loss of concentration, memory lapses (brain fog), etc. The menopause transition also brings about fears and anxiety around aging, “becoming invisible”, losing our relevance, feeling like an outlier, losing direction, and the physical bodily changes to our skin, muscle, hair, weight, etc. We are aging and there’s a certain amount of sadness associated to that. Although many studies about hormone therapy’s impact on moods/cognition are inconclusive and/or suggest further investigation, there is some evidence that hormone therapy can help calm some disruption and help us feel more like ourselves, where we feel well enough to take other steps (seek treatment, exercise, etc.) to manage our moods and cognition. Further reading for mood swings/brain fog: What happened to our ability to fall asleep, and STAY asleep? Data from the National Institutes of Health indicates that sleep disturbances varies from 16% to 42% before menopause, from 39% to 47% during menopause, and a whopping 35% to 60% after menopause. According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention, insufficient sleep is linked to the development of a number of chronic diseases and conditions including, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and depression. Sleep deprivation also affects our reflexes, reduces our coping capacity, critical thinking, and significantly affects moods and memory. Sleep deficiency impacts every aspect of our health and well-being so it is important to address this issue sooner than later. There are a variety of tools and sleep aids available, whether it be prescription medication, OTC supplements and/or incorporating sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques found online, podcasts, etc…the following are some common recommendations. Scientific research for OTC (over-the-counter, non-prescription) options is limited and contradictory. Labels may not accurately reflect the ingredients, and most are only recommended for short-term use. Please consult your doctor/pharmacist before starting any new supplement as they can interfere with existing medications, affect blood labs, or have other negative short-or-long term affects. Hormone replacement therapy (MHT/HRT). Consists of estrogen (estradiol) and a progesterone. Estradiol can help lessen/eliminate night sweats, which may be contributing to sleep-loss, and progesterone (non-synthetic Prometrium), has a calming, sleepy property that helps with sleep when taken before bed. Off-label and/or sleep prescription medication, including antidepressants. Further reading: Why… oh why?! Decreasing hormones does not cause weight gain, but hormonal changes can alter weight distribution, where weight settles around the middle and becomes annoying belly fat. Even those that never had excess weight around the middle before are alarmed at the sudden change. Menopause does not slow down our metabolism but aging does. A Science journal found that metabolism doesn’t fall during menopause, but remains roughly stable between the ages of 20 and 60, but then declines approximately 1% per year after that. Between the ages of 30-40 we start to lose muscle mass/tone (sarcopenia), which accelerates as we enter menopause, losing as much a 8% of muscle each decade. Muscle helps to burn more calories (even at rest) and the less muscle we have, the more fat we gain. According to the Mayo Clinic, by engaging in regular strength exercise we can gain muscle back at any age. According to the January 2024 review on the Importance of Nutrition in Menopause and Perimenopause: The prevalence of obesity increases with age. The incidence of abdominal obesity in women increases with age, and a rapid increase is observed in middle-aged women. Weight gain is a symptom of menopause, experienced by 60â70% of middle-aged women. On average, women gain about 6.8 kg per year during their midlife period (ages 50â60), regardless of their initial body size, race, or ethnicity According to 2022 WHO data, 55% of women are overweight or obese. Health consequences include: There are many other variables as to why we gain weight, such as we may become less physically active as we age, but continue to consume the same amounts as before; our exercise recovery takes longer; we experience increases in overall inflammation; lack of sleep affects cortisol levels, blood sugar regulation (among other things), stress, fear, and anxiety also triggers a cortisol response, which directly affects belly fat. Belly fat has serious consequences for health, especially because visceral fat (deeper fat surrounding our organs) increases our risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Visceral fat is considered abdominal obesity when waist circumference is greater than 88cm (35"). According to the American Heart Association waist size predicts heart attacks better than BMI, especially in women. Knowing your waist circumference is helpful to assess risk for heart disease, diabetes and stroke. The best way to do this is to measure your waist. According to the Mayo Clinic, to correctly measure your waist circumference: (you can find visual charts online) The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute indicates that for those in the ‘overweight’ or ‘obesity’ BMI range, a waist circumference of >88 cm (35") have a higher disease risk. Each 1cm (0.4") over 88cm (35") increases cardiac disease by 2%. The National Institutes of Health states that “women who carry excess fat around their waists were at greater risk of dying early from cancer or heart disease than were women with smaller waistlines, even if they were of normal weight”. Knowing weight circumstance also helps to determine a condition called Metabolic Syndrome, and is diagnosed when at least 3 of 5 conditions below are present: It is important to know these levels, so talk to your doctor about specific testing The good news, is that we have the ability to significantly lower these risks. A reduction of 5cm (2") is enough to lower the risk of heart disease by 15%! We can take steps to lose weight, exercise, and take medications to treat any abnormal conditions. Regular exercise may not specifically target visceral fat but studies indicate that high-intensity exercise training (HIET) can reduce total abdominal fat and regular exercise can help keep visceral fat from returning. We cannot specifically target weight loss in one area, but to effectively lower waist circumference, we must consume fewer calories overall and our bodies will decide how and where to lose. Losing weight in menopause is possible, but requires planning and tracking. Focus on healthy, sustainable eating habits over time. Some find success adopting intermittent fasting, where you only eat between a certain period of time (ie: between 11:00 am and 7:00 pm) and the rest of the time only consume water. Others find success following a keto plan or variations of that. The Mediterranean diet for heart health is more plant-based, and incorporates heart-healthy fats and whole foods. There is no special trick to losing weight in menopause. It is simply finding a healthy eating plan and routine that works for you. Avoid anything too restrictive, monitor calories, incorporate heart-healthy foods, drink enough water, get regular sleep –consistency and long-term sustainability are key. The good news is that weight loss is NOT contingent on exercise; while exercise is important for overall health (keeps our bones and muscles strong) it does not effectively contribute to weight loss. So if losing weight and incorporating exercise into your daily routine are things you’d like to change, consider focusing on a healthy-eating routine first; changing lifestyle habits all at once is a lot to take on, which ultimately leads to failure. Once your are comfortable in your dietary routine, then consider incorporating an exercise plan. Ultimately, numbers on the scale don’t matter, extra weight here and there isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A large study from the Ohio State University found that “people who are at normal weight at age 31 and gradually move to overweight status in middle or later adulthood have the lowest mortality risk, even compared to those who maintain normal weight throughout adulthood.” Focus on OVERALL health, not just what numbers say on a scale. The menopause transition is a time to take stock, reassess, and determine how we want to spend the remainder of our lives. Taking charge of our health is empowering and the following are things we can incorporate right now! Quitting smoking, eating healthier, maintaining a healthy weight, de-stressing, sleeping better, etc… are all things we all know and hear so often as the answer to everything, but it is especially important for us during menopause. Symptoms may persist no matter what we try but by making some simple changes, we can help minimize the effects of many symptoms and be healthier overall. Menopause, and living without estrogen, is for the rest of our lives, but by incorporating some of the recommendations below, we can improve our health and quality of life. Quit smoking is one of the most important things you can do. Not only does cigarette smoking increases risk for earlier menopause, it also intensifies symptoms. Specifically, smoking increases risks for frequent and severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes). Eat healthier. Cut back on sugars, caffeine, processed food, and introduce more plant-based whole foods, more fibre, more protein, more water. According to the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, dietary data from over 50,000 postmenopausal women found that the risk of developing insomnia was greater in women with a higher Glycemic Index diet and for those who had added sugars. Limit Alcohol. Alcohol makes menopausal symptoms worse and increases risk for heart disease, stroke, and osteoporosis. Alcohol is also one of the biggest risk factors for breast cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Maintain weight. Pay attention to waist circumference and not so much the numbers on the scale. (see the section on menopausal weight gain above) Exercise more. Particularly strength training can improve menopausal symptoms, as well as improve bone density, BP, and hot flashes as noted in this 2023 study The Efficacy of Strength Exercises for Reducing the Symptoms of Menopause. Exercise doesn’t always have to be for a long duration, or too rigorous (it takes much longer for our muscles to recover in menopause). It is important to build/maintain muscle which helps prevent bone loss, and practice balance to prevent falls. Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutritional scientist suggests the best exercises for women going through the different stages of menopause are, “lift heavy shit - carefully. Do high intensity interval training and plyometrics (jump training). Up your protein. Do less volume and more intensity. Recover longer.” A recent 2024 study on the impact of physical activity on menopausal symptoms found that yoga particularly helped with vasomoter (hot flashes), sleep, joint pain, and urogenital symptoms. Challenge your brain by learning new things (a language, new instrument). Do things like using your non-dominant hand to do everyday tasks (like brushing teeth), do math in your head, learn a new skill. Take vitamins as necessary, when we know we are deficient (often found in medical testing) and/or we are not consuming enough through foods. Overall it is best to get as many nutrients through diet, rather than supplements. Manage mental health by incorporating a variety of techniques, such as acupuncture/acupressure, massage therapy, physio therapy, practising de-stressing techniques (mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing,), picking up hobbies, listening to music, dancing, walking, yoga etc. Essentially find something that you enjoy doing. Try to get consistent full night’s sleep. Whether that means changing to cotton/bamboo sheets, bringing in fans, opening windows, taking prescription medication, CBD or other sleep aids. Lack of sleep contributes to brain fog, body aches/pain, critical thinking, moods, chronic illness…and on and on. Sleep is so incredibly important to our overall health and well-being! Accept emotions, crying jags (for no apparent reason) are normal. Wallow if you have to, stay under the covers, eat a tub of ice-cream and rage against the world, but know it is perfectly okay (and healthy) to give into moments of despair. Don’t beat yourself up when you need to withdraw for awhile. If you are struggling, reach out to others, seek counselling, etc. Monitor, track and document symptoms as this is the best way to see trends in cycles and help make sense of what you are feeling and experiencing. It is also excellent information to share with doctors. Find a good medical practitioner who will listen and is skilled in menopause. This is harder than it should be as most doctors are not trained to recognize symptoms of menopause and understand less about treatment options. (see navigating your medical appointment below for more) Check The Menopause Society (previously the North American Menopause Society) to find a menopausal practitioner near you. Get regular health check-ups for things like heart health, bone scans, blood-work, arthritis, skin issues, eye exams, dental cleaning, mammograms, pelvic exams, etc. Be your own best advocate means that you know your body more than anyone else; your limitations, strengths, and when things feel “off”. Arm yourself with knowledge, read scientific research, take a close look at ingredients of things, collect data and bring it your doctor if necessary. It is empowering to take charge of our own health care journey and instead of waiting for doctors to “do something”, we can use that knowledge to ask questions, demand answers and challenge the status quo. Expect your doctor to know very little (or nothing at all) about menopause and even less about treatment options Doctors are likely less informed than you are and simply do not recognize the signs of peri/menopause. They do a poor job of listening, and are quick to dismiss symptoms as being anything other than stress or anxiety. (What Doctors Don’t Know About Menopause) If under the age of 45, doctors refuse to even acknowledge that it could be perimenopause, they only know that the average age of “reaching” menopause is 51 (which is true), but anything before that (e.g., perimenopause) must all be in your head. Common, lazy and dismissive responses from doctors are: “You are too young to be in menopause” “You are anxious/stressed, here’s a prescription for anti-depressants” “Lose weight, exercise more, do yoga and you will feel better” “It’s normal aging, you’re fine” “Dry vagina? you need to have more sex” “You can’t have hormone therapy until you are menopausal/post-menopausal” “Hormonal blood tests will confirm if you are in peri/menopause” Many doctors rely heavily on the FSH test (hormonal blood/saliva) as their main diagnosing tool. This test does not provide a definitive diagnosis of perimenopause. Because estrogen and progesterone wildly fluctuate during peri/menopause, the test cannot capture anything more than what hormones were doing on that day, which has no bearing on anything. Therefore, a hormonal test taken at one point in time only indicates what your hormones were doing on the one day the test was taken, and are not indicative of what hormones are doing the other 29 days of the month. Unfortunately, many doctors demand this test, claiming that it’s necessary to know levels before they can provide treatment, or to “prove” that everything is “normal”. Doctors just don’t know any better. But for many menopausal clinics and functional medicine practitioners, hormonal testing is insisted upon, because it’s a money-making scam, meant to keep you coming back for more testing while they ‘attempt’ to ‘balance’ hormones. No reputable doctor or menopause society recommends hormonal testing as a diagnosing tool for peri/menopause. Two common outcomes of hormonal testing are: Normal or Post-menopausal hormonal levels are not a true indication of anything. Menopause clinics almost always insist on hormonal testing. They then offer products to ‘balance’ those hormones, tweaking dosages/supplements in an attempt to get hormone levels to fall within certain ranges. Balanced hormones do not equate to optimum health, or have any correlation to peri/menopausal symptoms. The only time FSH testing is beneficial, are for those who believe they are post-menopausal but no longer have periods as a guide (those who had induced/surgical menopause). Then a series of regular/consistent FSH testing may be effective at confirming menopause. Also for younger women (in their 20s or under the age of 44) who haven’t had a period in months/years, then FSH tests at ‘menopausal’ levels, could indicate premature ovarian failure/primary ovarian insufficiency (POF/POI). The British Menopause Society’s stance on hormonal testing: Blood tests are rarely required to diagnose perimenopause or menopause in women aged over 45 and should not be taken. While measurement of FSH has often been used in the past to diagnose perimenopause or menopause, the level fluctuates significantly and bears no correlation with severity or duration of symptoms or to requirement for treatment. Reducing inappropriate use of testing FSH levels will produce savings in terms of cost of test, time for further consultation to discuss the results and will reduce delay in commencing agreed management. Dr. Jen Gunter, author of The Menopause Manifesto states: A screening test can’t apply to menopause because menopause is a normal biological process. A diagnostic test isn’t needed because, medically, we determine menopause has occurred based on one year of no menstruation for someone age 45 or older. (Hormone Testing and Menopause). … Just as you didn’t need blood tests to check on your journey through puberty, you don’t need blood work to track your progress towards menopause. In fact, there is no test that can accurately predict where you are in the menopause transition. And one isn’t needed, because we don’t offer therapy based on hormone levels, we offer therapy based on symptoms and risks for conditions, such as osteoporosis. It is essential for your doctor to review family and personal medical history, including other blood work to determine overall health and risk factors. Provide your doctor with a synopsis of your basic lifestyle, such as smoking/drinking habits, personal history of weight issues, cancers, depression, etc. A review of family history should include: Alzheimer’s disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, cancers, liver disease, thyroid disease, heart disease, blood clot disorder, to name a few. Symptoms are what determines a peri/menopause diagnosis, or rather the elimination of those symptoms as being due to something else. Provide detailed information about your symptoms, how they affect your quality of life (are they debilitating, annoying, causing family disruption, relationship issues, causing pain?). Do not let your doctor dismiss your concerns with claims of “normal aging” and/or “a normal” FSH result alone! Many of the symptoms listed above, are found in other illness/diseases, therefore it is important to follow-up with testing to rule out any other potential causes and to get a baseline of your current health. Examination could include a physical exam, weight/height measurements, etc. Blood tests could include liver/kidney function, anemia, fasting blood sugar, triglycerides, lipid (cholesterol), thyroid. Other testing includes mammogram, bone mineral density test, pap screening, pelvic ultrasound, etc. If doctors do not offer further testing for specific symptoms, then request them. Other potential tests to request from your medical professional: Common blood work: What do they recommend to treat x, y, z symptoms? What can you expect from the drug/medication? What are the risks vs. benefits of each? What does it treat specifically? How long until it begins working? Are there concerns about long-term use? What are their thoughts on hormone therapy? If you know you want to try MHT, then it’s important to be direct and ask for it. Doctors will not willingly offer MHT, or they will make every effort to discourage you from pursuing it with claims of “it causes cancer”, “you’re too young”, “you must be post-menopausal first”, etc. (You don’t have to be post-meno before starting MHT, in fact research indicates it’s more beneficial if started during perimenopause.) Be prepared to stand your ground, provide your reasons and directly ask for it. Example: “My symptoms are significantly impacting my quality of life, I’ve read the scientific research, am aware of my personal/familial risks, and believe I am a good candidate for MHT. I would like to trial it for 6 months, after which time we can review.” Other phrases to try: Bring this to your doctor: The Menopause Society’s 2022 hormone therapy position statement (PDF) Doctors hear, “I’m anxiousness, not sleeping, have pain, mood swings/depression”, and immediately jump to prescribing antidepressants and other sleep/pain medications. While these medications may be very effective at treating the specific symptom they are not addressing the underlying issue, which is declining estrogen. While some medications have off-label benefits, such as helping with hot flashes, they also have other side effects and risks which may exacerbate existing menopausal symptoms, cause issues that are also symptoms of menopause, or become addictive/difficult to wean off. Again it’s important to understand what you are taking, why you are taking it, and for how long. Many doctors are fearful of prescribing menopause hormone therapies as viable treatment options, citing outdated sources of increased risks for various cancers, however some OB/GYNs may be better informed regarding the current research on risks/benefits of menopause hormone therapy. (see why doctors are failing women) If you are generally unhappy with a doctor’s assessment and suggested treatment, it is best to find a new doctor who will listen and act. Alternatively, arm yourself with knowledge and go back to your doctor with research, and be prepared to argue your case (see above suggestions on effective phrases, as well as the Menopause Society’s hormone therapy position statement). Oftentimes it feels like it’s impossible to find someone who will listen, who understands menopause and can offer effective treatment options, so it may mean visiting a few doctors before finding the right fit for you. Our Menopause Provider Directory provides a list of menopause practitioners, and some links allow you to search near you. Also it’s important for those who see gynecologists (instead of General Practitioners GPs), to ensure other health factors are considered. While gynos tend to focus on reproductive issues, it is absolutely necessary to have a full body work-up that focuses on other areas as well, especially heart and bone health. The most important thing to realize is that you do not have to suffer. Women tend to put ourselves last or believe we can get through difficult situations on our own, while we silently suffer with aches, pains, sleep deprivation, hot flashes, dryness, mood swings, etc. We need to recognize that we aren’t meant to ‘suffer through’ menopause. Getting three hours of sleep a night is nothing to be proud of, and lack of sleep alone is enough to seriously impact many symptoms as well as our ability to simply function day-to-day. Symptoms can be mild, annoying, debilitating and everything in between, dependent on monthly cycles and/or declining estrogen. There are many options that work, but the trick is to find something that works for you. There are generally two camps on traversing menopause: For most of us starting the menopause transition, we first look to holistic options and supplements to help minimize symptoms. Why involve drugs and invite potential complications from side effects and increased risks? Without prescribed hormones, “going natural” often refers to the use of herbs, vitamins, supplements, over-the-counter hormonal treatments, traditional medicine (acupuncture, etc) diet, exercise, and incorporating comfort items (cooling clothing/sheets, fans, etc). Some women employ a combination of vitamins/supplements, along with prescribed medications such as anti-depressants, sleep aids, etc. While many women find the right balance to deal with some symptoms, there is not enough evidence to prove that any over-the-counter product works. Supplements are not regulated, and there is no requirement to offer scientific evidence of efficacy. They often make claims of higher success rates due to their own in-house low quality studies and/or rely heavily on anecdotal user reviews. Holistic treatments may contribute to an overall sense of well-being and ‘healthiness’, but they won’t specifically address the underlying issue…which is declining hormones. See the sections above for more tips on incorporating methods to help with some symptoms: Disclaimer: The following are common recommendations. Some vitamin deficiencies can be identified with medical lab tests, but dosage amounts should be discussed with your health care professionals (dietitian, etc) for any potential conflicts with diet and/or existing medications. It is important to learn about the side effects and risks of any over-the-counter herbal/supplement/vitamin. Recommended dosages may be at unsafe levels or not meant for long-term use. This list is just a starting point to consider, please do your own research, discuss with your doctor/pharmacist and decide what is right for you. Generally it is best to get vitamins through food consumption as much as possible for effective absorption, but sometimes it is difficult to get enough through foods. Seek out a reputable (and legal) source to discuss your needs The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health provides more information of some herbs listed above. The Menopause Society indicates that now (in 2025), more than 1 billion women worldwide will be post-menopausal. Marketing agencies recognize this abundance of buying power and we are seeing more over-the-counter options (Amberen, Estroven, Remifemin, Menosmart) and online support clinics targeted at treating menopause. These OTC ’treatments’ are marketed at inflated prices and contain a variety of ingredients listed above. Each claim to help with menopause symptoms, however there is limited research to establish their efficacy. It may be better (and cheaper) to buy singular vitamins/supplements, rather than buy a product with a bunch of ingredients/fillers specifically marketed for menopause. Menopause and women’s “wellness” is big business, with the global menopause market size to be worth about US$ 32.7 billion by 2030. Celebrities are talking about it, and menopause is rapidly fuelling women-focused startups, ‘femtech’ companies, tele-medicine, and a myriad of products for anti-aging, hormones, weight loss, cooling devices, etc. More and more online services are jumping into the menopause industry, providing customized hormonal testing and individualized attention for a price. Services are advertised by “trained medical professionals” and “knowledgeable staff”, but this may not always be the case, therefore it is important to thoroughly research these ‘clinics’ before giving them your details and your money. Online services can offer both supplements and menopausal hormone therapy, but we need to pay attention to what type of ‘bioidentical’ hormones are on offer. Many clinics make their own compounded products (hormones and supplements) and insist on hormonal testing before they offer services, as a way in which to keep you coming back for more testing and for more supplement or hormonal adjustments. (No medical or menopause society recommends compounded hormones or hormone testing.) SERMS produce some of the benefits of estrogen, and should be considered for those cannot do MHT (or choose not to). SERMS provide relief for some symptoms but also prevent osteoporosis. Discuss these options with your doctor if you are not a candidate for MHT. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. Hormone therapy, replaces or simply ’tops-up’ our estradiol enough to treat symptoms. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Most people are good candidates for hormone therapy. Dosages and method of delivery varies, but the ‘right’ dose is where symptoms are managed and you feel an overall sense of well-being. Balancing hormonal levels is not the goal of hormone therapy, the goal is finding “balance” in how you feel. However hormone therapy cannot treat every symptom of peri/menopause, so it’s important to have realistic expectations of what hormone therapy can-and-cannot do. (what to expect when starting, or changing hormone therapy) Menopause hormone therapy (MHT), or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is prescribed by medical practitioners and commonly consists of two hormones: estrogen and progesterone. It is necessary to include progesterone if you have a uterus and take estrogen. If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required however, even without a uterus, progesterone may be a good option to include as it can help with sleep. (Synthetic progesterone does not provide sleep benefits.) Both hormones come in a variety of dosages and applications. Some have both estrogen and progesterone combined into one application, while others are separate in two different methods of delivery. Birth Control Pills (BCP) are suitable during early stages of perimenopause to help with some symptoms and when pregnancy is a concern. The hormones in birth control are different than those found in MHT. BCP are generally higher dose, synthetic hormones, meant to ‘override’ your own hormones, and have less customization in terms of dosages and/or method of delivery. Most birth control pills contain ethinyl estradiol (a more potent estrogen) which is not used in hormone therapy. Ethinyl estradiol is synthetic that provides a steady dosage of hormones throughout the day (while suppressing your own ovarian function). Oral BCP (and oral HRT) increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure and stroke. Some symptoms of menopause may not improve while taking birth control pills. Users of BCP can generally continue on this regime until roughly the age 50-55 (speak to to your doctor) and then switch to MHT to assist in the transition. For those in perimenopause, BCP can help regulate/eliminate periods, and lower risk of pregnancy, and can help with some symptoms of perimenopause. In comparision to BCP, hormone therapy are low dosages of hormones (also have many choices of dosages and methods of delivery). The most common, well-tolerated, and âsaferâ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered âbioidenticalâ hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as âbioidenticalâ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day (does not suppress our ovarian function, but simply “tops up” our existing hormones). Transdermal does not increase risks for blood clots, high blood pressure or stroke. For those in perimenopause, HRT generally does not regulate/eliminate periods (unless using a high dosage of progesterone or an IUD), does not prevent pregnancy (unless using an IUD), but helps with many symptoms of peri/menopause. In sum… both BCP and HRT contain different hormones, and our bodies may use them differently, so one might work better than the other, but it just depends on the individual (is pregnancy a concern?) and stage of perimenopause. Testosterone (androgens) therapy (pills, patches, implant, gels, injections) is an entirely optional treatment for specific menopause symptoms. Younger women in surgical menopause may need more testosterone than those within ’normal’ menopause age ranges. Many women use testosterone to help with low libido, hair loss, and building muscle, but excess testosterone can contribute to some negative side-effects such as, voice deepening, facial whiskers, and acne. Testosterone is not FDA-approved for use in women, therefore it’s difficult to determine suitable dosages. (more about testosterone, symptoms, treatment, etc below) MHT professionals agree (also confirmed by research), there is a universal ‘window of opportunity’ of when to start hormone therapy in order to receive the most benefits without many risks. More recent research supports starting MHT during perimenopause (rather than waiting until post-menopause) as early intervention provides better outcomes. This window is: Being under the age of 60 - OR - less than 10 years of becoming menopausal. Studies indicate that women over the age of 60, that have gone more than 10 years without estrogen (ten years since their last period) are actually at a higher risk of stroke, heart attack, and dementia if starting estrogen for the first time. However this does not necessarily mean that anyone over 60 cannot use MHT, but much depends on overall health, medical history, and personal risk factors. This means that women who fall outside the window of opportunity must discuss MHT options with their family doctor and weigh their own risks vs. benefits, particularly as it pertains to cardiovascular disease. If hormone therapy is provided to those outside this window, there are indications that the hormone therapy benefits may not provide the same benefits as those who are within the window. This is because a significant amount of time (10+ years) has passed without circulating estrogen, therefore the body’s estrogen receptors may not start working again when estrogen is re-introduced, resulting in marginal symptom relief/benefits. (While science up to this point heavily reiterates the dangers of starting hormone therapy outside of this window, there is a recent call for medical professionals/scientists to revisit this 10 year over age 60 limit.) “Thereâs a window of opportunity,â said lead study author Dr. Lisa Mosconi, director of the Alzheimerâs Prevention Program and the Womenâs Brain Initiative at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City. âHormones work best for the brain when taken in midlife in presence of menopausal symptoms to support women through the menopause condition.â If a woman began estrogen-progesterone therapy after the age of 65 or more than 10 years after the start of menopause, dementia risk rose, said Mosconi, a neuroscientist. This ‘window of opportunity’ is not the same thing as continuing with hormone therapy after the age of 60. For instance, if someone starts hormone therapy at age 55, and continues with it well into their 60’s and 70’s, there are newer studies supporting the safety and benefits of staying on hormone therapy for longer periods of time. (there may be other reasons, but these are the most prominent) For anyone considering MHT and has had ANY cancer, it is imperative you consult with your medical professional team (GP, gynecologist, endocrinologist, oncologist, etc) to determine if MHT is safe for you. For most people, hormone therapy (MHT/HRT) consists of systemic estrogen and progesterone (or progestin). If you have a uterus, it’s imperative to take progesterone (or progestin) along with any estrogen, as it protects the uterus. The concern is that unopposed estrogen causes the uterine lining to thicken, and this thickening significantly increases risk of endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer risk increases when the progesterone dosage is not adequate (not the right dosage in relation to the estrogen) or when progesterone is not taken at all while using systemic estrogen. (If you do not have a uterus, then progesterone is not required, however some studies indicate that progesterone is beneficial for those in perimenopause to help with symptoms, and may provide other benefits even without a uterus. However, for post-menopausal women without a uterus, taking progesterone is shown to have little benefit/value, although it might help with sleep.) Estrogen and progesterone/progestin dosages are dependent on the method of delivery; each has their own benefit vs. risk ratio. Also, the some hormone delivery methods may not absorb as well as another, so it might take some trial and error to find the right dosage for you. Below are some common types of hormones and dosages. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safer’ estrogen is transdermal estradiol, found in patches, gels and sprays, which are derived from soy/yams. They are considered “bioidentical” hormones designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because it is a marketing term and not a medical one. Even though transdermal estrogen is pharmaceutically manipulated, it is almost identical to our own hormones. Transdermal methods provide a more steady, consistent dosage of hormones throughout the day. In terms of safety, transdermal estrogen is absorbed through the skin where it directly enters the bloodstream. Transdermal does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore dosages tend to be lower, DVT risk (blood clot) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol) but may not have an effect on HDL. Patch brand names include: Alora, Climara, Estradot, Menostar, Vivelle-Dot, etc. These contain estradiol, the main hormone for sympoms of menopause. Dosages vary from the lowest at 0.025mg up to 0.1mg, so it’s often best to start at the lowest dosage and work up to higher dosages as symptoms dictate. Depending on the brand, patches are applied weekly, or twice a week (every 3.5 days). Each brand may contain slightly different chemical properties, so switching from one brand to another may cause some symptoms to temporarily return. (actual patch size and adhesive quality varies depending on the brand) Some patches stick better than others, so the edges might curl and cling to clothing or loosen/fall off when exposed to high heat/sweat. Patch-“dumping” can occur if they get hot/wet, such as when sitting in a hot tub, where the estradiol dumps/releases all at once. For hot tubs, it’s best to remove the patch entirely, carefully place it back in the package it came in, and re-apply after. Covering the patch with something like tegaderm tape can help keep the patch protected and from falling off. Follow the package inserts of where to place the patch, oftentimes the “fattier” the area the better it is for absorption Note: Lately there’s been a lot of discussion on r/menopause and r/perimenopause that some patch brands are back-ordered or not available for extended periods. In these instances, many are forced to switch patch brands, or switch to a gel/spray, or go without their estrogen for periods at a time. Gels are applied daily, directly to the skin. They are spread over an area of skin and left to dry. Drying time is commonly a few minutes, and it’s recommended to leave as much time as possible (at least 2 hours) before showering/swimming. Gels are colourless but may have a slight alcohol odor when first applying, but once spread onto skin it dries quickly. Each brand of gel may have different application areas, for instance Estrogel is commonly recommended to use on arms (wrist to shoulder), while Divigel is applied to upper thighs. Note: Follow the package inserts of where to use the gels Sprays are applied daily, directly to the skin (commonly inside of forearm, below elbow) through a cone applicator. It should not be rubbed into skin, but air-dries within a few minutes. Combined transdermal patches contain both an estrogen/estradiol and a progestin (synthetic progesterone) Because the synthetic progesterone (progestin) is combined in one patch with estradiol, there may be different effects than an estradiol-only patch. A recent study suggests that some women (20%) may be “poor absorbers” of transdermal estradiol, and might require higher dosages to manage symptoms. Therefore, it is important for hormone therapy to be tailored for your needs (symptoms and risks factors), rather than assuming one-size fits all. There is only one systemic vaginal estrogen-only ring which stays in the vagina for up to three months, releasing estradiol acetate. Oral estrogens are entirely synthetic hormones, containing conjugated estrogens, esterified estrogens, etc. Oral estrogen carries slightly higher risks and side effects. Tablets seem to have a short half-life, so tend to ‘dump’ hormones at once shortly after taking it, and then quickly winds down, so it may not provide a steady/consistent dosage of estrogen throughout the day. In terms of safety, oral estrogens have the first pass through the GI tract and liver, therefore they may require highers dosages than those found in transdermal methods, and carry slightly higher risks for DVT (blood clots). Oral may increase inflammatory markers, triglycerides, and blood pressure, and can also increase HDL (‘good’ cholesterol) but might decrease LDL cholesterol. Association Between the Route of Administration and Formulation of Estrogen Therapy and Hypertension Risk in Postmenopausal Women where oral estrogen is associated with a higher risk of hypertenstion compared with transdermal and vaginal estrogens. (Note: Premarin/Prempro oral tablets contain conjugated equine estrogens. Premarin was first introduced in the early 1940s and gained popularity throughout the 1980s. In 1992 it was the number one prescribed drug, and because Premarin has been around a long time, it one of the most well-studied and effective menopause therapies. However, Premarin is made from PREgnant MARe urINe, which involves keeping horses in a perpetual state of pregnancy while confining them in small stalls for long periods of time. Given the inhumane treatment of mares, Premarin has since significantly fallen out of favour.) Progesterone (brand name Prometrium) non-synthetic (‘bioidentical) derived from soy/yams, designed to be very similar to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. It is commonly called “micronized progesterone”, which means it has been processed into very small particles, and this makes the hormone easier for the body to absorb and use. Progesterone carries less risk than synthetic progesterone (progestins). There is no known risk of breast cancer with progesterone. (Relationship between menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer) 100mg oral continuous/daily / 200mg cyclical. Micronized progesterone (Prometrium) has a calming, sleepy property and should be taken at night before bed. Vaginal administration of progesterone is off-label use in most countries and may not provide adequate uterine protection, therefore this method should be closely monitored for unwarranted bleeding Rectal use is unknown as well, since much of the science has to do with fertility, not peri/menopause. Also, oral medications may not break down correctly due to the lack of gastric acid, and the coating on the tablets. Using progesterone vaginally (off-label) might help lessen some oral side effects, it’s important to be aware of potential risks. (Note: Prometrium pills contain peanut oil and may cause allergic reaction for those with peanut allergies) Crinone* (progesterone gel) is a vaginal gel containing micronized progesterone in an emulsion system (commonly used for fertility) The active ingredient is either a 4% or 8% concentration. A small 2000 study found that those using vaginal Crinone 4% in cyclical and constant combined regimens controlled bleeding and provided endometrial safety. However, currently there are no large scale studies to substantiate these claims. Progestins (synthetic progesterone) carries a small but increased risk for breast cancer. However progestins provide excellent uterine protection from the effects of estrogen (keeping the uterine lining thin). Hormone Therapy Dosage Guide from the Australasian Menopause Society may be helpful when switching between products and determining approximate dosages of various hormones. It is important to find the right dosage between estrogen and progesterone, not only to manage symptoms, but also to ensure adequate uterine protection. (Inadequate dosages of progesterone may increase risk of endometrial cancer.) The dosages outlined above are standardized and proven to provide adequate uterine protection, dependent on the estrogen dosage and whether or not the progesterone is administered daily or cycled on/off. It may take some trial and error before finding the right dose and method of delivery that works for you, but when it is “right”, it can make a world of difference in how we feel. According to the International Menopause Society’s (IMS) Paper on Menopause and MHT in 2024: Timing of MHT commencement is also a controversial issue in menopause care. MHT has been primarily researched in women who are either post-menopausal (i.e. usually 12 months after the final menstrual period) or, in some studies, in late perimenopause. For those who are menopausal (aka post-menopausal), hormone therapy should be started before the age of 60 and less than 10 years from the last period. (see the window of opportunity for starting hormone therapy). Prescribing MHT in perimenopause can be difficult because the fluctuations in hormone levels can result in episodes of estrogen deficiency rapidly followed by espisdoes of estrogen excess. … MHT remains an option for these women if they are symptomatic, recognizing that MHT is off-label in this phase of life. Considerably more research is needed to determine optimimum MHT regimens for perimenopausal women. Sequential therapies are preferred but even these may cause irregular bleeding. This is likely why BCP are most offered during perimenopause, because “menopause” hormone therapy is considered off-label during the peri stage. BCPs suppress your own hormone production, essentially shutting down the hormonal swings – with the added function of regulating/eliminating periods, while preventing pregnancy. Whereas hormone therapy for menopause are lower dosages to simply “top up” our own hormone production, they do not regulate periods (unless you’re using a high dosage of progesterone/progestin or an IUD), and do not prevent pregnancy (again unless it’s an IUD). It doesn’t mean that hormone therapy can’t (or shouldn’t) be prescribed during perimenopause, it simply points out that this is likely why doctors prefer to go the BCP route for those in peri.for many perimenopausal women, combined oral contraception or levonorgesterel intrauterine devices (IUD) are most often prescribed. Doctors who are willing to prescribe Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) likely follow the adage, “prescribe MHT at the lowest possible dose for the shortest period of time”. Starting MHT at a low dose is generally recommended for those in the average peri/menopausal age range however, if symptoms persist after a trial period, then doctors should be open to dosage increases as necessary. For those in surgical or early menopause at a younger age, it is recommended to start with a higher dose estrogen than for those going through menopause at an ‘average’ age. The shortest period of time recommendation is a bit trickier to identify, in that symptoms can continue much longer than originally anticipated and it becomes difficult to know when to stop MHT, especially if symptoms are managed on the current dosage. Why would we risk stopping our hormones to potentially have symptoms return? Studies indicate that MHT can continue for as long as needed to obtain the best benefits. Essentially as long as we are healthy, monitored by doctors, and re-assessing our risks and benefits at regular intervals, there may be no need to stop hormone therapy at a certain age. According to the International Menopause Society’s 2024 Menopause and MHT paper: There is now universal agreement amongst national and international menopause societies that arbitrary limits should not be placed on the duration of use of MHT. The IMS governing principles state, ‘Whether or not to continue hormone therapy should be decided at the discretion of the well-informed woman and her HCP, dependent upon the specific goals and an objective estimation of ongoing individual benefits and risks’. The Menopause Society’s 2022 position statement on hormone therapy (PDF) indicates that: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years. The Beers criteria from the American Geriatrics Society has warnings against the use of hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years. However, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. Of note, the continued use of hormone therapy in healthy women aged older than 65 years at low risk for breast cancer and CVD is limited by insufficient evidence regarding safety, risks, and benefits. The Menopause Society recently published (April 9, 2024) the study: Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women’s health outcomes by types, routes, and doses which suggests the… “possbility of important health benefits with use of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years”. The inserts/medication guides found within MHT packaging contain detailed and scary warnings about all the dangers of MHT. This is because of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) 2002 study. These insert warnings may eventually change based on updated information, however do not let them scare you off MHT. Starting hormone therapy for the first time can feel scary, it is afterall a medication, and something that has the potential make everything worse or increase risks for other things, especially based on those package warnings. Some may have experienced negative side effects with hormonal birth control and come to the conclusion that they cannot tolerate hormones in any form. For the majority, hormone therapy is actually very well-tolerated, with minimal side effects and has the potential to greatly increase our quality of life. Some things to expect when starting hormone (or changing) therapy: As well as helping with many symptoms, research indicates that MHT has a secondary benefit to our overall health as we age. Also, more recent theories suggest that estrogen might play a much bigger role in how we age (more than just losing ovarian function in menopause). Scientists are finding that estrogen affects just about every organ and system in our bodies, and are now just examining the effects of estrogen and the aging process. Below is a sampling of the more common benefits found in multiple studies,but is it important to do your own research as well. Further reading about hormone therapy benefits: As with any medication or treatment, there are side effects and risks. Testosterone is an entirely optional hormone treatment. It is not FDA-approved for women, therefore long-term safety data, benefits and risks are lacking. However, a 1% testosterone cream was recently licensed for women’s use in Australia and perhaps this will prompt others to follow suit. There is a steady decline of testosterone after our reproductive years, but a small increase during menopause. For those in surgical menopause, the drop may be more extreme (50% lower than women who experience menopause ’naturally’). Unfortunately health care providers have not identified a standard “normal” testosterone test level for women. Even if labs results indicate low levels, this may not mean women automatically experience any of the symptoms below. If symptoms are not evident, then low T levels alone is not reason enough to seek treatment. Testosterone therapy is gaining popularity for the treatment of Female Sexual Arousal Disorder (FASD) or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Indications are that testosterone treatment is very effective for post-menopausal people with FASD/HSDD, but data is lacking for those still in perimenopause. The first line of defence for low libido/decreased sex drive is MHT (estrogen and progesterone). According to the Australasian Menopause Society, “a trial of testosterone therapy may be appropriate for some women whose symptoms do not improve on MHT alone”. Therefore, if there is no improvement after a certain time on MHT, adding a low dose testosterone is recommended. It is important to get regular total testosterone levels checked before and during treatment to help minimize risks noted below. Testosterone may be another possible treatment to improve bone mineral density. The science is contradictory, but one study of 2,198 female participants (ages 40-60) found a positive correlation between testosterone and lumbar bone mineral density. There may be other reasons for low testosterone (other than menopause), so it is important to talk to your doctor about other potential causes. Also, oral estrogen therapy can lower testosterone levels. Due to the lack of scientific research and no dosage guidelines for women, it is difficult to get doctors to prescribe testosterone. Compounded pharmacies offer testosterone creams and pellets (implants) but dosages could be at unsafe levels, and/or different levels each time a dose is administered. Further reading about testosterone therapy: Synthetic hormones: are different to what your body produces, and only mimic our own hormones. These are often found in birth control pills and in oral menopause hormone therapy (tablets that contain conjugated estrogens and progestins). Synthetic forms of hormones tend to have more risks/side effects, but may be more effective and beneficial in some circumstances. Synthetic versions have been widely used for many years and therefore have been exposed to more rigorous scrutiny in research studies. (Synthetic estrogens and progestin were used in the 2002 WHI study.) Bioidentical: is a marketing term, not a medical one. These are hormones claiming to be “identical” to the hormones our bodies naturally produce. They are heavily advertised compounded hormone ‘products’ with bold claims of being completely natural, healthier, safer, and better for us. The advertising is slick and convincing, offering us the illusion of personalized and customizable care. Bioidentical compounded hormones are widely promoted by menopause clinics, naturopaths, holistic medicine, celebrities and even endorsed by doctors, which can be misleading and confusing. The confusion is because there are no clear definitions of what constitutes “bioidentical”, or how safety standards are applied to each formation. The term bioidentical is used a lot when describing hormone therapy, but can mean different things to different people, and largely dependent on the source of the hormones, the manufacturing process, and the method of delivery. Therefore, it is important to make the distinction between heavily marketed/widely advertised compounded hormones, and “bioidentical” pharmaceutical,(FDA-approved) hormones, firmly established in medical science. Below is a breakdown of the main differences between science-based ‘bioidentical’ hormone therapy and marketed (compounded) hormones. Bioidentical “pharmaceutical” hormones: are science-backed, FDA-approved hormones, made from a plant steroid found in soy and wild yams (diosgenin), which are then pharmaceutically manufactured by large-scale laboratories. These hormones are not widely promoted as ‘bioidentical’ because (again), this is a marketing tactic, and not a term used by the medical community. However, even though the estrogen and progesterone are pharmaceutically manipulated, they are in fact almost identical to our own hormones. The most common, well-tolerated, and ‘safest’ “bioidentical” estrogen is transdermal estradiol (found in patches, gels, sprays), vaginal estrogens, and micronized progresterone. Transdermal estrogen does not have the first pass through the liver, therefore DVT (blood clot risk) is lower, they may decrease blood pressure, triglycerides, and LDL (bad cholesterol). These hormones are formulated in carefully controlled environments, undergo strict testing standards, are subject to peer-reviewed scientific data, contain precise, consistent and accurate dosing in relation to preventative measures, such as osteoporosis. So while these hormones are not advertised as such, they are considered “bioidentical” in that the hormones are very similar to our own hormone production. Bioidentical “compounded” (marketed) hormones: are custom-made by a pharmacist in a compounding pharmacy. They are also derived from the same plant sources (above) but also include other combinations of miscellaneous ingredients, including less active estrogens (estrone, estriol) and fillers. Pharmacists (or hormone marketing companies) mix special formulations in-house where they use the same “raw” FDA-approved hormones that big pharma uses, but then they mix these hormones with other agents to make up the troche, pill, pellet or progesterone cream. Since each pharmacist (or marketing company) combines their own formulas, the final mixed product is not FDA-approved. There is no quality control or consistency from one dosage/mixture to the next, and for this reason, compounded medications cannot be standardized, tested or FDA-regulated/approved as being effective or safe. These products are heavily promoted as being ’tailored to your own needs’ by popular online menopause clinics, naturopaths, unaware doctors, and functional medicine/nurse practitioners. There is no scientific data supporting the efficacy of these final products. Particularly compounded topical/transdermal progesterone (cream) is not well absorbed through skin, therefore it does not protect the uterus from the effects of estrogen, which can have serious consequences. Even if symptoms improve with compounded hormones, due to the high probability of inconsistent ‘mixed’ dosing, compounded hormones may be at unsafe and dangerous levels. Each time a prescription is filled, the hormone amounts may be different, at risky levels, contain impurities, or not contain adequate dosages to prevent osteoporosis or endometrial cancer. It is important to note that testing hormone levels does not provide this information. As part of their advertised ‘customization’ of hormones, menopause clinics, functional medical practitioners, naturopaths, etc promote regular and ongoing hormone testing to check hormonal levels in an attempt to guide dosing. There is zero scientific data to support hormone testing to ascertain absorption levels, and there is no menopause society that recommends hormone testing as a way to manage estrogen therapy dosages. While both bioidentical options listed above begin with the same hormones (extraction of the steroid from soy and wild yams), the final product from compounded pharmacies is not bound by any inspection process or testing. Overall, there is no truth to claims that compounded bioidentical hormones are safer, healthier, better metabolized or tolerated. There is no research to support they lower risks for breast cancer or are safer than FDA-approved biodentical hormones. Whereas, FDA-approved biodentical hormones are held to high standards, undergo extensive safety protocols, and are scientifically researched, so we know exactly what we are getting, and in safe dosages appropriate for our needs. Bioidentical “pharmacuetical” hormones are safer than both compounded hormones and synthetic oral estrogens, because we have a lot of scientific data to support this. Compounded testosterone was also found to have significant differences in measured concentrations in finished preparations, not only between different pharmacies but also inconsistent mixtures made within the same pharmacy. While Australia is the only country (right now) who offers approved 1% Androfeme testosterone for women, there may not be any other available option for obtaining testosterone outside of compounded pharmacies. Therefore it is important to be aware of the high probability of inconsistent dosing when using compounded testosterone. The American Medical Association states that “given the unpredictable pharmacokinetics of compounded formulations, the use of cBHT cannot be supported in comparison to well-tested FDA-approved hormone therapy options. The Endocrine Society’s statement on compounded bioidentical hormone therapy: “Bioidentical” hormones, particularly estrogen and progesterone, have been promoted as safer and more effective alternatives to more traditional hormone therapies, often by people outside of the medical community. In fact, little or no scientific and medical evidence exists to support such claims about âbioidentical hormones.â Additionally, many âbioidentical hormoneâ formulations are not subject to FDA oversight and can be inconsistent in dose and purity. As a result of unfounded but highly publicized claims, patients have received incomplete or incorrect information regarding the relative safety and efficacy of compounded bioidentical hormone therapy. … Hormone customization is very difficult to achieve, because blood hormone levels are difficult to regulate accurately due to normal physiologic and pharmacokinetic variations and limitations of readily available assay methods. Nonetheless, proponents of cBHT assert that simple tests of saliva can provide the information necessary to customize hormone doses. These claims are not supported by scientific data confirming assay quality control, standardization, or clinical correlations. The revised global consensus statement on MHT states that: the use of custom-compounded hormone therapy is not recommended because of lack of regulation, rigorous safety and efficacy testing, batch standardization, and purity measures. Dr. Jen Gunter on compounded hormones: It isn’t uncommon to see compounded hormones that are concoctions, a mix of estradiol and estrone and estriol (sold as Bi-est or Tri-est) or with DHEA or testosterone and this is offered as some kind of âbespokeâ mix tailored for your needs. This is a sales tactic. There is zero data that these special mixes do anything, but they are more expensive and give the illusion of customization. … Compounded products are typically paired with lab work that further enhances the illusion of safety. This might be salivary hormone testing (which is useless for menopause in every way as it’s not even accurate, so your provider is literally charging you for a medically worthless test), urine testing, or blood work. I can see how the specialized blood work and the review of the lab work with a provider makes the patient feel heard, and can enhance the placebo effect, but that is all it is. That and wasted money. The Menopause Society on compounded hormones: Custom-compounded hormones are not safer or more effective than approved bioidentical hormones. They are not tested for safety and effectiveness or to prove that the active ingredients are absorbed appropriately or provide predictable levels in blood and tissue. In fact, they may not even contain the prescribed amounts of hormones, and that can be dangerous. For example, when the progesterone level is too low, you are not protected against endometrial (uterine) cancer. When estrogen levels are too high, there can be overstimulation of the endometrium and breast tissue, putting you at risk of endometrial cancer and possibly breast cancer. Further reading on bioidentical compounded hormones: HRT is not without controversy. It is a topic that is debated so often, that we have dedicated an entire section below about its controversy and many commonly held beliefs. The 2004 National Use of Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy report indicates that: In 1975 Hormone therapy prescriptions peaked at 30 million. Prescriptions subsequently declined to approximately 15 million in the early 1980s as evidence emerged showing an increased risk of endometrial cancer with unopposed estrogen use. Prescription growth resumed as progestins were prescribed in combination with estrogen, and prescriptions for hormone therapy reached 36 million in 1992, representing approximately 6 million women.” A hormone therapy history timeline from the Management of perimenopausel and menopausal symptoms The results of the study were immediately released to the media without any customary review or due diligence, resulting in the shocking headline: “HRT Causes Breast Cancer!”. At the time, the NIH director of the study was quoted as saying that the NIH was going for “high impact” with the goal “to shake up the medical establishment and change the thinking about hormones” and in that respect they were successful, as their message doomed hormone therapy for millions of women from 2002 to today. Unfortunately, what was widely reported was exaggerated, misleading or just wrong, but the damage had already been done. Where Are We 10 Years After the Women’s Health Initiative? Hormone therapy has changed since this study. Estrogen dosages tend to be much lower, there are alternative delivery methods, and the timing (when to start hormone therapy) matters. The WHI study’s condemnation of hormone therapy has been long and far-reaching. Most anyone today immediately associates MHT with increased risk for breast cancer, and many doctors still refuse to prescribe it, simply based on findings from a flawed study, 20+ years ago. Hormone therapy does have risks, but more recent research indicates that the risks are not statistically significant as originally reported, and that MHT should be offered as a viable treatment option for symptoms of menopause for women under the age of 60. Estrogen does not cause breast cancer, it may be cancer ‘promoting’, but this is different than cancer ‘initiating’. Breast cancer risk simply increases as we age - with or without hormones. The study found that for the older women there was a 26% increase in the risk of breast cancer compared with those women who were assigned the placebo. This translated to 39 women per 10,000 on MHT, compared with 30 women per 10,000 taking the placebo (9 cases per 10,000 equals less than 1% absolute risk increase). To put this in perspective … the risk of breast cancer for those older women taking MHT, was similar to the risk reported due to obesity and low physical activity. Further, the risk of breast cancer from using MHT was only slightly higher than the risk (found by the same study) of drinking one glass of red wine a night, but less than the risk of drinking two glasses of wine a night. A different 2020 large, observational study found that 3 glasses of milk/day increased breast cancer risk by 80% (even one glass raises risk to 50%) Comparatively, breast cancer risk from hormone therapy is lower than drinking two glasses of red wine a day, or one glass of milk. But yet the ‘hormones cause breast cancer’ fear solidly remains today. The two hormones used in this study were oral conjugated equine estrogens and progestin medroxprogesterone acetate. The synthetic progesterone (progestin) was the hormone linked to the slight increased risk in breast cancer. New research indicates that non-synthetic progesterone does not carry that same risk. Also the risk for venous thromboembolism (stroke) is also reduced when the method of delivery is transdermal estrogen (patches/gels), not oral estrogen. Research indicates that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause. When hormone therapy is started before the age of 60 and within 10 years of entering menopause, there is also an important secondary consideration, and this is the overall long-term benefits to our health. New studies show that MHT is beneficial for the maintenance of bone, heart and brain health (among other things) and that MHT can lower risks for a number of diseases, and help keep our bodies healthy and active well into old age. Breast cancer risk is something we all must all pay attention to regardless, but with advanced early detection screening tools, prognosis is excellent and survivability rates have significantly increased. The more serious issue for menopausal women is heart disease, and we should be more concerned about the higher risks of dying from CVD. The stats for women are scary, according to the World Heart Federation, 1:3 women will die from heart disease, but yet breast cancer still creates far more anxiety. Compared to breast cancer screening, heart disease detection is abysmal. Heart attacks are difficult to diagnose, mostly because health care professionals do not recognize that women’s symptoms are very different than men’s, therefore we are under-diagnosed, do not receive further testing or treatment. Misdiagnosis ultimately contributes to the fact that more women die from heart attacks compared to men. Breast cancer will always be something to watch for, but heart disease is what’s likely to kill us. The good news is that we can significantly lower our risks for heart disease by managing our health (lowering BP and cholesterol levels, increasing exercise, etc) and consider the potential long term benefits of MHT. Interestingly, after women stopped taking estrogen due to the 2002 WHI’s findings, cardiologists noticed a distinct uptick in heart disease deaths in these women, concluding that estrogen is connected to maintaining heart health. Also, another study of 80,955 post menopausal women found that after they discontinued their MHT, there was a 55% increase in the risk of hip fracture. Hip fracture in postmenopausal women after cessation of hormone therapy Further reading on hormone therapy: Current recommendations from leading specialty societies endorse the use of MHT in recently menopausal women with appropriate indications. The evidence supports cardiovascular benefit for MHT initiated early among women with premature or surgical menopause and within 10 years of menopause in women with natural menopause. The benefits of MHT (ie, including lower rates of diabetes, reduced insulin resistance, and protection from bone loss) appear to outweigh risks for the majority of early menopausal women. Perimenopausal women should be provided individualized guidance on MHT and options for treatment, particularly when vasomotor symptoms are present. MHT ameliorates most of the traditional CVD risk factors, with different effects, depending on the type, dose, route of administration and type of progestogen. MHT may reduce the risk of CVD events if prescribed within 10 years since the FMP or in postmenopausal women <60 years old and at low-moderate CVD risk. However, MHT should currently not be prescribed for the sole purpose of CVD prevention. For those seeking menopause advice and treatment from gynecologists, it is important to keep in mind that these physicians may not necessarily be skilled in screening for Type II diabetes (which can significantly increase risk for heart disease), cholesterol levels and overall heart function. If your obgyn is not equipped to manage issues of heart care, then it’s important to follow up with another doctor for regular heart health screenings. Hormone therapy is still not widely promoted today, largely because of the continued systemic fear generated from the WHI study, however that is slowly changing. There is a lot of misinformation out there, and unfortunately many doctors continue to perpetuate that misinformation. While we should trust our medical professionals,(why wouldn’t they know everything about our bodies?) we need to wake up to the fact that doctors know almost nothing about menopause, and even less about treatment options. They hear the same fear-based information we do, and are reluctant to bring up hormone therapy, let alone prescribe it. We need to put ourselves first, look at all the options, and find a good doctor who actually understands the benefits of MHT in relation to our own health and needs. Due to the ongoing concerns surrounding hormone therapy, we still do not have significant, definitive research on all the risks and benefits. There is a need for high quality, long-term randomized clinical trials. Menopause is for the rest of our lives; more than one-third (or half) of our lives will be spent in a menopausal ‘state’. We are living longer and quality of life is important as we age. Menopause, and hormone therapy are definitely featured more prominently in news, social media, and advertisements, which is bringing the discussion back to the forefront, with headlines like, “Menopause Hormone Therapy is Making a Comeback” (Mar 2025) and “Menopause is Finally Going Mainstream”. While it’s great to see the shift and recognition, there is still much more to be done. We need to see more studies being done peri/menpausal women, treatment options, and a better understanding of how our hormones work. One such promising study is looking at piecing together the first female medical genome as it relates to ovarian function, after realizing that for women, “estrogen is the central axis of their metabolism and that is why women age in a different way: they age twice as fast (as men) due to the lack of estrogen”. Another recent article (July 2023) by the Wall Street Journal poses the question, What if We Could Get Rid of Menopause?. These are new and exciting developments, and it’s about time that a normal biological process (experienced by half the population) is finally gaining attention after largely going unnoticed for generations. We support accredited academic research and receive constant requests from various universities to survey our subscribers. These include cognitive effects in menopause; experiences of menopause in the workplace; the relationship between menopause, memory and sleep; LGBTQ+ and menopause; mental health care and menopause; effects of estrogen on liver health in post-menopause; chronic pain; menopause experiences on social, personal and cultural levels, and many more! We are all in this together, all one-billion of us! We are the sandwich generation, either caring for young adults, aging parents, and/or providing emotional and financial care to others. We may struggle to get through each day, whether that means maintaining employment, social activities, finding time (and energy) for exercise, proper nutrition, or simply trying to get out of bed every morning. We are worried about retirement, money, relationships, health, aging, our value to society, the future, and the world around us. For many, it may not feel like we are wholly supported in the menopause transition, especially when our main medical establishment is failing us … but we know the tides are changing. As more of us step onto this crazy menopause ride, we become a force to be reckoned with. We must demand more from our employers, businesses, and most importantly, our health care professionals, and insist attention be paid to our specific needs, so that the next generation doesn’t have to say “what is happening to me” or “why didn’t anyone tell me”? Menopause creates a whole new unexpected emotional toll and that’s why it’s important to reach out to others, ask questions and get help. We simply cannot do it all, but we deserve quality of life, and to feel amazing and happy! Finally … know that periods will stop, symptoms will settle down, and we will feel liberated to embrace this next stage of our lives! It is our time.

Title: Apple’s C-suite undergoes major reshuffle — here’s what it means for CEO Tim Cook
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/07/14/business/what-apples-c-suite-reshuffle-means-for-ceo-tim-cook/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T14:30:22Z
Full Content:
Apple has quietly undergone a major restructuring of its management team that has sparked speculation about the future of the world’s third most valuable company — but CEO Tim Cook isn’t going anywhere. Even as the iPhone maker faces mounting challenges — from AI stumbles to fading product innovation — the 64-year-old chief executive retains firm control of the company founded by Steve Jobs, even as most of his direct reports are nearing retirement age. And with longtime lieutenant Jeff Williams set to retire later this year, Cook’s leadership appears more entrenched than ever, according to Bloomberg News. Williams, Cook’s most trusted deputy, will exit in December. Sabih Khan, Apple’s senior vice president of operations, who is in his late 50s, is slated to assume the COO title. Meanwhile, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri has been succeeded by Kevan Parekh, and longtime product executive Dan Riccio departed at the end of last year. The company is seeing its biggest management shake-up in decades. Nearly half of Cook’s approximately 20 direct reports are in their 60s and nearing retirement, including senior figures like marketing chief Greg Joswiak, App Store head Phil Schiller, environment executive Lisa Jackson and chip executive Johny Srouji. Cook, meanwhile, who turns 65 in November, has shown no signs of stepping down or preparing a successor. The departure of Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer and widely seen as Cook’s natural heir, leaves the company without a clear backup plan, Bloomberg News reported. It also reinforces Cook’s position as the indispensable figure guiding Apple through turbulent times. Williams was uniquely positioned as both COO and unofficial backup CEO. Khan, while assuming the title, lacks the breadth of experience and institutional knowledge to immediately step in as chief executive, according to Bloomberg News. The situation is drawing industrywide comparisons to other long-tenured corporate leaders like Disney’s Bob Iger and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon, who have extended their influence well past traditional retirement age. For Cook, whose tenure as CEO began in 2011, the prospect of remaining at Apple’s helm for another five years is increasingly likely as there is little urgency from Apple’s board to initiate a transition, Bloomberg News reported. The directors — longtime allies including Arthur Levinson, Susan Wagner and Ronald Sugar — have largely deferred to Cook, who has delivered a staggering 1,500% increase in Apple’s stock price since succeeding Steve Jobs. Though shares are down 16% in 2025, Cook remains the board’s trusted operator during a period of technological and cultural flux. Under his watch, Apple expanded into China, launched successful new product lines like the Apple Watch and AirPods and transitioned into a subscription-driven business. These achievements, however, are being challenged by Apple’s growing design stagnation, lagging AI performance and mounting criticism from developers and regulators. While rivals like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI rolled out advanced AI capabilities early, Apple is seen as trailing far behind. Its flagship initiative, “Apple Intelligence,” launched significantly later than competing products and still lacks several features that were promised during its 2024 debut. Still, there is no indication that the board is losing confidence, according to Bloomberg News. Inside Apple, Services head Eddy Cue has reportedly warned that the company risks becoming “the next BlackBerry or Nokia” if it fails to pivot quickly. Those concerns, coupled with the AI backlash, have prompted a reorganization of the org chart and the beginnings of a strategic reset. In order to right the ship, some have floated acquiring a top-tier AI startup and grooming its CEO for the top job. But insiders dismiss that possibility outright. Apple has reportedly explored acquisitions of companies like Perplexity and is considering Mistral, highlighting its increasing urgency in the AI arms race. The recent loss of Ruoming Pang, Apple’s foundation models chief, to Meta in a deal reportedly worth more than $200 million, only underscores the stakes. Despite the leadership uncertainty, Apple has a slate of new products on the way, including updated iPhones, iPads and a refreshed Vision Pro headset. But the changes are largely incremental — spec bumps rather than groundbreaking innovation, according to Bloomberg News. In the absence of revolutionary hardware or AI breakthroughs, the question of Cook’s eventual exit– and what comes after — continues to loom over Cupertino. For now, however, the CEO remains firmly in charge. And with no clear successor in place, the company’s future is still very much Cook’s to shape. The Post has sought comment from Apple.

Title: Meta trial becomes test of board culpability over corporate scandals
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2025/07/14/meta-trial-becomes-test-of-board-culpability-over-corporate-scandals/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:32:36Z
Full Content:
Meta luminaries will publicly testify in a Delaware corporate law court this week over shareholder allegations that board mismanagement was directly responsible for billions in sanctions that the social media group paid over data breaches. Two of Facebook parent company’s best known executives, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and former chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, are listed as witnesses in the eight-day trial, which starts on Wednesday. Long-time director and investor Marc Andreessen, as well as former board members Jeff Zients, a former top adviser to former US president Joe Biden, are also set to appear. Other director defendants include the investor Peter Thiel, Kenneth Chenault, the former American Express chief executive and Reed Hastings, the Netflix co-founder. The lawsuit, brought by three tiny minority Meta shareholders, is the first time a complaint over a board’s culpability for a corporate scandal has reached a trial in Delaware, where most such lawsuits are quickly dismissed. In a handful of instances, companies have settled litigation over board oversight charges, most notably the directors of Boeing who agreed to pay $237.5 million (€203 million) over shareholder charges that the highest levels at the aviation titan failed to prevent the 737 Max scandal. In the lawsuit, the shareholders accuse Meta’s directors of knowingly overseeing lax privacy practices, in violation of a 2012 consent decree struck with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) designed to protect users’ personal information – claims that the defendants reject. The FTC later launched an investigation into Facebook’s parent triggered in particular by the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which user data was leaked to a political research group through a third-party app. The suing shareholders have asked for damages stemming from the $5 billion settlement struck with the FTC in 2019 following the investigation. According to the plaintiffs, the board “protected” Zuckerberg by approving the price tag without any internal investigation, in return for the FTC agreeing to drop his name as an individual defendant in the case. Plaintiffs also allege that the founder “unlawfully sold billions of dollars of Meta stock because of the material non-public information (“MNPI”) he had regarding the company’s illicit, undisclosed data sharing practices”. [ Meta wins AI copyright case in blow to authorsOpens in new window ] Meta declined to comment on the case. In court filings, the defendants argue that the social media company’s directors did not knowingly violate the 2012 consent order, and that the board’s decision-making was prudent and not conflicted. Meta faces continued regulatory and legal scrutiny over issues including privacy and antitrust. Critics have argued that its aggressive hunt for growth and profits as a younger company led to online harms, with the company accused of amplifying hate speech and misinformation to juice engagement, or having poor data management practices. More recently, it has poured billions of dollars into trying to become a leader in artificial intelligence. “The allegations are significant in terms of who knew what and when during their largest scandal that they’ve had as a company,” said Jason Kint, a Big Tech critic who leads the Digital Content Next trade group of online publishers. “What’s at stake is the trust of the company – not just for the users but for the shareholders.” Shareholder lawsuits alleging poor board oversight have become known as “Caremark” claims, named for the healthcare company whose shareholders alleged corporate law liability over criminal fraud charges in the 1990s at the healthcare company. [ Meta introduces advertising to WhatsApp in push for new revenuesOpens in new window ] Scholars and judges have long been sceptical that wrongdoing stemming from business operations far removed from the boardroom could be pinned on the offending company’s directors. Directors can also offer a defence that pushing the boundaries of the law is consistent with maximising shareholder value. In the case of Meta, its market capitalisation has soared to nearly $2tn. “Increasingly there is a view that other regulators are not robustly doing their job and only corporate law and securities law can bail out victims,” said Ann Lipton, a law professor at the University of Colorado. Meta notes in its court briefs that Delaware judges have previously remarked that a Caremark claim “is possibly the most difficult theory upon which a plaintiff might hope to win a judgment” and that Meta’s “evidence will show that Facebook implemented a robust system of privacy controls” after the 2012 FTC consent decree. [ European Union risks becoming the ‘museum of the world’, says Meta privacy chiefOpens in new window ] The company has, however, already faced setbacks. The core Caremark claim from the plaintiffs has already survived Meta’s motion to dismiss. Separately, the court earlier this year granted sanctions against Sandberg, who left her executive role in 2022 and the Meta board in 2024, for deleting email messages from her Gmail account after being put on notice about the lawsuit. Last week, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz said it would move its incorporation from Delaware to Nevada, citing “recent actions by the [Delaware] Court of Chancery, which have injected an unprecedented level of subjectivity into judicial decisions, undermining the court’s reputation for unbiased expertise”. The Financial Times has previously reported that Meta has pondered moving its incorporation out of Delaware, the state that has traditionally dominated incorporations by both public and private companies. Technology companies have been spooked by the 2024 decision by Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick to rescind a $55 billion pay deal that Tesla had previously struck with its chief executive, Elon Musk. That case will soon be heard on appeal by the Delaware Supreme Court. Chancellor McCormick is the judge who will now oversee the Facebook trial. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X prices may have leaked — and if true, it's not as bad as I thought
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/the-xbox-ally-and-xbox-ally-x-prices-may-have-leaked
Time Published: 2025-07-14T11:00:48Z
Full Content:
Microsoft and ASUS are gearing up to launch the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld later this year, and the biggest questions remain fixed on price. Do we have our first answer? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few weeks ago, we exclusively leaked the Xbox Ally, codenamed Kennan, in development with ASUS ROG. The Xbox Ally range is powered by Z2 APUs, including the first handheld that will sport the Z2 Extreme on the high-end. These devices will have a heavily customized Windows 11 experience, complete with the first iterations of boot-to-full-screen-app capabilities. The new Xbox app will handle multi-tasking and other system features with an interface more intuitive for controller use, while also likely being the most powerful gaming handheld in existence. Given that last fact, people are expecting the Xbox Ally to also have a powerful price tag. There have already been some rumors about its price range flying around, from anywhere between $800 to over $1000 dollars. A new report from 3DJuegos (via IG) may have given us the first glance, leaked by ASUS itself. And honestly, it's not as bad as I was expecting. Although these prices may still just be place holders or some weird quirk of Google's new AI-"enhanced" search algorithms, Google Search store meta data scraped from ASUS' website, seemingly, suggests that the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X will closely match their predecessor's retail price, at least in Europe. For comparison, the previous Z1 Extreme ASUS ROG Ally X is currently also €899 in Europe at RRP, although it's currently on sale for $100 off on Amazon Germany. ASUS and other hardware retailers rarely do 1:1 price conversions on devices like this. At the current exchange rate, an €899 euro ASUS ROG Ally X would come in at $1050 US if that were the case. Instead, the ASUS ROG Ally X typically sports a $799 RRP in the United States, although some US retailers like Best Buy have it at $899 right now, likely due to stock limitations. Indeed, purchasing power, VAT, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and other factors go towards deciding the finalized price. Flat currency conversions are not how prices are decided, so take analyses making such claims with a huge pinch of salt. Given the constant evolution of the tariff situations emanating from the United States, you can bet that ASUS and Microsoft could wait until the last minute to finalize the price point. There is an event on the horizon that Microsoft typically prioritizes its PC announcements at, though, in the form of Gamescom in Germany, so it wouldn't be outside the realm of possibility for a formal announcement there. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Z1 Extreme regular ASUS ROG Ally is on sale for $649 in the United States, which is where these "leaked" prices potentially get a bit more interesting. The regular ASUS ROG Ally (Z1 Extreme) is available to buy at around €699 in Europe and $649-ish in the United States, which would put the base model Xbox Ally around €100 cheaper than its higher-end predecessor. This could be a reflection of the power disparity. The lower-end ASUS ROG Ally is listed as $499 on ASUS' website, for reference. The Z2 "A" chip in the base model Xbox Ally is thought to not be as powerful as the Z1 Extreme in the previous ASUS ROG Ally on paper. It's specifically designed to be more cost-effective and potentially more battery efficient. The Xbox Ally X Z2 Extreme will be the crown jewel of gaming handhelds, though, and the price point will reflect that. Model Configuration Price (USD) ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1 / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $499 ASUS ROG Ally (2023) Z1E / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $649 ASUS ROG Ally X (2024) Z1E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $799 Xbox Ally (2025) Z2A / 16 GB RAM / 512 GB SSD $599 (Estimated) Xbox Ally X (2025) Z2E / 24 GB RAM / 1 TB SSD $899 (Estimated) There has been speculation as to whether or not Microsoft would subsidize these devices, since it will be front-loading its Xbox PC store on them. I'd say that, increasingly, the era of subsidized "console" hardware is going to be a thing of the past, as players increasingly flock to PC and third-party software sales continue to be a smaller part of Microsoft's overall business. The Xbox Ally range are going to be Windows 11 gaming PCs in essence, meaning that you could buy one and never spend a penny on Microsoft's gaming ecosystem. It wouldn't make sense for Microsoft to subsidize it from their perspective. Either way, this could be our first real glimpse at the ASUS Xbox Ally price points. I would expect the United States price points to match the sticker price, rather than do a simple currency conversion. As such, I wouldn't be surprised if the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X come in at around $599 and $899 respectively, if these EU leaked prices are indeed accurate. It would closely match our previous predictions on the Xbox Ally price. But we won't know for sure until ASUS and Microsoft reveal it at their end. Better get saving, either way.

Title: 5 Challenges Facing New WPP CEO Cindy Rose
URL: https://www.adweek.com/agencies/5-challenges-facing-new-wpp-ceo-cindy-rose/
Time Published: 2025-07-14T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
Incoming WPP CEO Cindy Rose has a big job ahead when she steps into the role in September. As the Microsoft exec takes the reins from Mark Read, who’s departing after seven years at the helm, she inherits a business in decline that’s struggling to keep pace with an industry in flux. In addition to addressing WPP’s structural and financial problems—it issued a shock profit warning and downgraded its 2025 growth forecast last week—Rose must stave off continued client losses and turn around morale at its agencies. Industry leaders agree that Rose has the AI and technology expertise needed to bring WPP into the future. But what’s most crucial is that she develops a clear vision for a business that’s lacked one for some time. “Hopefully the WPP board are clear about what its new strategy is, as the current one has not delivered,” said Ajaz Ahmed, founder of Studio.One and former CEO of WPP agency AKQA. As the leader of a public company, Rose will have to contend with shareholders impatient for WPP’s stock to bounce back from historic lows. This will be difficult in a sector that is “facing real pressure,” said Ahmed. “Interest rates are still high. Budgets are tight. Platforms like Meta, TikTok, and Google offer increasingly sophisticated ad tools that bypass agencies,” he said. “Consulting firms and independent agencies are winning share with a more attractive value proposition.” In that pressure cooker, Rose’s strategic decisions will, in large part, be dictated by the board’s end game: Does it want to create a real strategy for WPP’s future, or would it be better off selling the company for parts? “There’s the financial engineering side—what will produce the most value for shareholders independent of the right strategy?” said Brian Wieser, principal at Madison and Wall. “Because the stock is so, so very low, it could very well be that the board would rather see some immediate benefits.” Martin Sorrell, CEO of S4 Capital and former CEO of WPP for three decades, said it comes down to whether the business “would be better off being dismembered into its still standing constituent parts or consolidated elsewhere.” “Companies that were once part of WPP, such as Kantar, VCCP, FGS, and Globant have thrived as independent companies,” Ahmed pointed out. “The question is, could WPP realize the value in some of its assets before it’s too late, or does it want to merge and consolidate its agencies further internally?” If the board does want to pursue a future for WPP in this current state, Rose needs a clear strategy and point of view for the business—something observers agree has been lacking. “The big concern for shareholders and employees isn’t just the structure; it’s the absence of a clear, credible plan,” Ahmed said. “For a while now, it’s felt like WPP has been making it up as it goes along.” For Wieser, that challenge gets to the heart of an existential industry issue: “how do you organize a modern agency group, and what should the agency services industry look like?” While Read merged agencies under WPP to streamline its unwieldy operations, he hasn’t gone as far as his peers in operating the company as a single brand. Instead, he’s touted the importance of agency brands as levers for attracting clients and talent, Wieser said. But that approach has drawbacks for WPP, including adding “layers of non-billable overhead both at the central level and within the agencies,” as well as “tremendous duplication of services,” Ahmed said. “Ogilvy has become a holding company within a holding company, which isn’t exactly simplification.” Wieser agreed that agency mergers weren’t a real strategy. “That was desperation,” he said. “There’s a recognition these will be loss-making entities on their own, so let’s do the bare minimum.” Coming in as an industry outsider, Rose will have to quickly develop a point of view on the role of agency brands and identify the right structure to take WPP into the future. “Being both a holding company and a client-facing brand at the same time as managing dozens of agency brands with their individual cultures, leadership teams, and operations is confusing, and this model hasn’t worked for WPP,” Ahmed said. Under Read, WPP invested millions of dollars into WPP Open, its internal AI platform. It will be Rose’s job to make that bet pay off—and set WPP up for an AI-powered future. “The significant investment into WPP Open hasn’t yielded the growth that was hyped a couple of years ago,” Ahmed said. According to Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester, WPP chose a tech executive with an AI background for exactly that reason: “The selection of Rose is designed, in part, to further commercialize WPP Open,” he said. Ahmed agreed that Rose’s experience at Microsoft, which “hasn’t exactly been shy about reinventing themselves over the years,” will be useful in pushing WPP to adapt to automation. But whether that’s enough to transform the legacy holding company’s business model remains to be seen. “WPP is a services company, not a software company,” Pattisall agreed. “Modernizing WPP itself, as it reconciles with automation and change, will be no small task.” “I’m not convinced that agencies can build a SaaS-type business in competition with software companies like Adobe,” Sorrell added. Rose is taking over a business where morale is low and client relationships are tenuous. WPP has lost several major clients this year, including Mars and Coca-Cola. Meanwhile, ongoing layoffs and a botched return-to-work mandate have led to discontent and anxiety among staff. Sorrell pointed to what he views as a misguided simplification strategy under Read, which collapsed brands like J. Walter Thompson, Young & Rubicam, and Wunderman, as the reason WPP has lost “not only many talented leaders, but clients as a result too.” Nick Emery, CEO of agency Jellyfish and a former WPP Media exec, believes Rose’s biggest challenge will be to “fight for, protect, and champion the many brilliant people who’ve given their all to the company—and to craft a strategy that makes them happier, drives growth for clients, and fully embraces the role of AI to fulfill the promise of technology.” Rose’s attention here must be “24/7, laser-focused on the USA,” according to Sorrell, which is “undoubtedly the center of the client world and where WPP people are probably most demoralized.” “You have to hope—if you’re hoping for good things for WPP—that she’s an excellent manager,” Wieser added. “That’s probably the single most important issue.” Rose’s industry outsider status could be a challenge or benefit, depending who you ask. Ahmed described her as “a safe pair of hands” as “an internal candidate with an external vantage point.” Sorrell said she fits WPP board chairman Philip Jansen’s criteria as a technology and AI-forward executive. But Wieser pointed out that in addition to this being her first CEO gig, her only ad industry experience has been through the vantage point of sitting on WPP’s board. “You really haven’t actually lived and breathed the industry,” he said of Rose. “It’s plausible that your views on the industry might be incomplete.” However, he added, “it can also mean fresh eyes, which is not a bad thing at all,” pointing to Michael Roth’s successful tenure at IPG. What’s crucial is that Rose surrounds herself with executives that have “clarity of vision.” “It’s going to come down to good management,” he said.

Title: Nvidia dethrones Apple as king of market milestones

Nvidia is the world’s first $4 trillion company, leaving Apple – long the king of market milestones – in its wake. Apple was the first to hit $1 trillion, $2 trillion and $3 trillion. But while its market capitalisation ($3.15 trillion) has idled since first closing above that landmark in mid-2023, Nvidia’s has quadrupled, fuelled by insatiable demand for its AI chips. Even that understates Nvidia’s rise: the stock is up more than 1,000 per cent since early 2023. [ Nvidia outpaces Microsoft and Apple on path to $4 trillion valuationOpens in new window ] That sounds bubbly, but staggering revenue growth suggests otherwise. Revenues rose 69 per cent last quarter to $44 billion, with another record forecast for this one. Its top customers – Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet – are to spend $350 billion on capital expenditure this year, much of it on Nvidia hardware. Valuation remains punchy, but not absurd. Nvidia’s price-sales ratio is nearly four times that of Apple’s, but the difference between their forward price-earnings ratios is slight. Nvidia bulls will note its growth rate is exponentially higher than Apple’s and its PEG ratio (which adjusts for earnings growth) is actually far lower. Apple is stable and cash-rich, but slow growth means it’s far from cheap. Nvidia appears riskier, but it keeps growing into its multiple. For now at least, investors are willing to pay up for speed over stability.

Title: Strap In, Vision Pro Owners
URL: https://spiral.spyglass.org/p/strap-in-vision-pro-owners
Time Published: 2025-07-13T18:05:15Z
Full Content:
Apple is apparently gearing up to launch an updated Vision Pro later this year, per Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The big upgrade? Not the new chip, which will only be mildly useful without much content that can actually push the device, but instead a new head strap. I'm not kidding. They better be selling this thing separately for current Vision Pro owners and not forcing people to buy a new $3,500 paperweight or there will be riots in the streets. Well, amongst the few dozen Vision Pro owners in any given area. I kid, but I don't. Clearly such an update would simply be a message to the market that Apple isn't abandoning their plans in the face of slow sales and developer adoption. They're not ready to unveil a real upgrade yet – that will come in 2027 – but the spec bump and head strap is throwing the proverbial bone out there. Obviously – obviously – the first Vision Pro should have been released as a dev kit as I wrote 15 months ago. I know it would not have been very Apple-like to do that, but Apple needs to start doing some un-Apple-like things, IMO. They could have leaned on the messaging that this future piece of technology wasn't quite ready for prime time, but developers could get a glimpse of the future today if they're willing to pony up. And if a consumer really wants to try it, well, sign up for a developer account and have at it. That would have flipped the narrative entirely here. And honestly, I'm not sure the messaging would have been that much different from the way Steve Jobs used to call Apple TV a "hobby". All this new strap will do is further showcase how badly Apple messed up the ergonomics here. The fact that the Vision Pro shipped with two straps in the box already said all you needed to know. Now we'll apparently have a third option – after Apple implicitly endorsed other third-party options as well. The entire package is entirely too inconvenient for most people to even consider using on a regular basis. This better be one hell of a strap. This article is sort of framed oddly, suggesting that Amazon is "weighing another multibillion-dollar investment in Anthropic" when actually, we know from a 10-Q filing that they're due to invest "an additional $2.7 billion by Q4 2025". So I'm not sure what they're "weighing" here as this money was already committed in the form of convertible notes in different tranches. I suppose it's possible that they could have already invested the $2.7B between that filing (in May, for the quarter ended March) and now, but it's highly unlikely. So perhaps they're thinking about investing more on top of that commitment? Or maybe lines were just crossed and this reporting on that (already known) commitment. Regardless, one tidbit here is that the tech giants are capped "to keep them well below owning more than a third of Anthropic". Google currently owns 14% and my backtracking math has Amazon currently at 22.4% (before any new investment), so both have some room to grow if they want to put more money in (and undoubtedly insane valuations which will make growing their ownership stakes much from here difficult). One more wildcard: what if Apple were to invest? They pulled back from the OpenAI deal last year, but if they're really considering Claude as a Siri replacement/supplement... [FT 🔒] I was back on Alex Kantrowitz's Big Technology Podcast to talk about all of this and more. And notably, we talk through the Apple/Claude potential partnership for Siri and yes, if it could portend an Apple investment into Anthropic... the startup is undoubtedly too expensive for Apple to buy at this point – nor would Amazon (or Google) want/allow that, but Anthropic needs money. Apple has money. Sidenote: I'll be back on Big Technology Podcast on a monthly cadence going forward. You can find it on Spotify here or Apple Podcasts here. [YouTube] Look, Dune Messiah would have been a cooler name but it also perhaps signals Denis Villeneuve's intent not to stick to that particular book and to go beyond it. At the same time, he talks about how he doesn't view this as a trilogy because he considers the first two to really be one film – so it's weird to call this one "Part Three", unless you consider this to also be a part of one (now really) long film? At least no one is going to be confused like they may have been with another Anya Taylor-Joy movie, Furiosa ("A Mad Max Saga"). Also, note the fact that it won't be shot entirely with IMAX cameras (like Christopher Nolan's The Odyssey will for the first time in a feature film) but clearly a lot of it will be. By the time he's filming his Bond, might he be ready to go all-in on IMAX? (Probably not – but again, certainly a good chunk of it!) [Variety] Mark Gurman and Riley Griffin were able to pull a few more details about the package it took to lure Ruoming Pang from Apple to Meta. "More than $200M" over a few years, largely in stock tied to performance of Meta's own stock (and probably some other metrics). But yes, there are likely large "signing bonuses" involved in these deals depending on how much equity the talent would be walking away from. In Pang's case, that's obviously just Apple RSUs and not startup equity, but you can see how such cash payouts can rise quickly. It all sounds in the range of a 'Godfather' offer. "Apple didn’t try to match the offer..." Yeah I mean the only question is if their counter would have been off by two or three orders of magnitude. [Bloomberg 🔒] When the author wrote about the two companies racing one another to hit the milestone, I doubt he thought that NVIDIA would cross it in less than a week. Such is the state of AI exuberance. And while Microsoft has clearly ridden the wave as well – to the tune of their highest P/E ratio in 20 years – their risks and rewards are clearly less binary than they are with NVIDIA. They also have more levers to pull, which is what we may be seeing now with the layoffs even in a time of seeming strength as their revenue-per-employee is far below that of say, Google. Poor Apple, just literally not in this conversation right now. They very nearly hit $4T themselves last December, but now are nearly a full $1T behind their old friend/foe NVIDIA and a good $600B behind their old foe/foe Microsoft. The first company to hit $1T and $2T and $3T will likely be the 3rd to hit $4T – if they do at all (come on, they will, but it's rough out there right now!). All that said, if the AI market falters, NVIDIA and Microsoft are falling, fast. While Apple will likely be sitting pretty thanks to their inaction and ineptitude in AI. [WSJ 🔒] Right after Dia, Perplexity's Comet is here – with OpenAI inbound... To me, the biggest news about Linda Yaccarino stepping down as CEO of Xitter is that Xitter still had a CEO. I honestly thought that when they merged with xAI that whole charade sort of went away. Kudos on lasting two years, I guess. That is about double what anyone guessed. [Axios] Apparently and remarkably, this is unrelated to the latest Xitter xhitshow as she was telling people about her departure earlier in the week. [NYT] Might she land at Paramount post-Skydance merger when her old boss Jeff Shell takes over the President role?... [THR] OpenAI's first "open" model (weights, not source) could be here as soon as next week. And yes, it may add even more pressure to the Microsoft relationship – will it be on every cloud soon? [Verge] As expected, Mistral is in talks to raise up to $1B, likely from MGX and others. Another deal that will make it harder for Apple to make a deal if they wanted to this path (if they even could)... [Bloomberg 🔒] While there's no word on Mistral's valuation, SpaceX seems poised to hit $400B, which would put them close to ByteDance (pre-TikTok sale) in terms of highest private valuation. Well ahead of OpenAI. For now. [FT 🔒] It's not just Meta that is poaching from OpenAI, OpenAI is also poaching from Meta – but really, mainly Elon companies with talent from Tesla and xAI. I'm sure OpenAI was devastated to have this news leak via internal Slack messages. [Wired] We're getting a live-action Hot Wheels movie, thus moving us one step closer to the prophecy of the Kool-Aid Man busting through a brick wall on the silver screen. [Variety] In other computing headwear news, Meta has formalized their investment in EssilorLuxottica – $3.5B into the publicly-traded firm for a stake just under 3%, which they hope to bring up to 5%. Most importantly, this seemingly formalizes the fact that Google/Samsung/Apple/Snap/etc won't be working with their brands on any competing products... [Bloomberg 🔒] 'Max' is now officially 'HBO Max' again with app icons being updated around the world. No need to download a new app this time (which was another amazing moment of stupidity in all this). And now the countdown is officially on until they're 'HBO' again. [Verge] "I would expect Grok to discover new technologies that are actually useful no later than next year, and maybe end of this year. It might discover new physics next year… Let that sink in." – Elon Musk, talking a big game (obviously as usual) with the release of Grok 4. Can xAI back up these claims better than Meta was able to back up Mark Zuckerberg's big claims about Llama 4? Or will Elon be next to step in with $500M pay packages and 'Godfather' offers? (The early results seem promising for Grok 4 – but they also did for Llama 4! You can try it out yourself for the low-low price of $300/month.) In July 2015, 10 years ago, NVIDIA's market cap was $10B. Yesterday, it hit $4T. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Algolia Tops Google In Product Search — Windsurf May Not Help Much

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Gartner rates privately-held Algolia ahead of Google in the $56 billion market for search and product discovery. With Alphabet stock down this year, investors should be worried. GERMANY - 2024/09/21: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone with the website of ai search ... More engine company Algolia Inc. is seen in front of business logo. (Photo Illustration by Timon Schneider/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The market for digital commerce search reached $56.5 billion in 2024 and is forecast to grow at a 12.6% compound annual rate to $185.7 billion in 2033, reports Data Horizon Research. Algolia’s customer base has grown at a 21% average annual rate to 18,000, according to my July 10 interview with Algolia CEO Bernadette Nixon. Google — shares of which have lost 5% of their value in 2025 — is confident in the strength of its product discovery search service, according to a Google company release. Gartner rates privately-held San Francisco-based Algolia ahead of Google. Google’s spent $2.4 billion to license Windsurf AI coding technology, reported CNBC. That unlikely to be enough for Google to surpass Algolia — or faster-growing AI rivals such as ChatGPT and Perplexity. Google shares have lost value in 2025. That’s because the search giant — which developed the core Transformer model for predicting the next word based on its context underlying generative AI, according to my book, Brain Rush — is struggling to catch up with ChatGPT and others when it comes to commercializing its idea. Is the drop in Google stock a buying opportunity? The answer depends on whether Google can keep its search business relevant. “The market will need to see fundamental evidence that Google search is indeed going to be more durable than currently appreciated,” Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak wrote in a report featured by Investor’s Business Daily. If rivals such as ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Meta AI better deploy generative AI to cash in on advertising and improved e-commerce and travel verticals, Google’s stock could keep dropping, noted Nowak. For Google bulls, I have bad news: Algolia — which says it is deploying agentic AI for brands — is ahead of Google in those two search and product discovery verticals. In 2018, I was surprised to learn Google had abandoned the business of helping consumers search through a company's online product catalog, according to my October 2018 Forbes post. Google was good at bringing users to a website but once there, customers relied on the websites’ own search functions to find products. Some companies "build their own engines; others use open-source software, such as Elasticsearch,” the Economist reported. At the time, Algolia — founded in Paris in 2012 — was rapidly taking a piece of that pie by supplying a service that "hunts the client’s website and swiftly offers consumers relevant results," added the Economist. Since then, Google has entered this market and this year was deemed a leader in Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for vision and ability to execute. However, within that elite group of leaders, Algolia is the top dog. Read on for why this market is significant and why I do not think Google is doing enough to overtake Algolia and larger rivals in monetizing AI. I requested comment from Google and will update this post if I receive a reply. While analysts use many ways to describe the digital commerce search industry, they agree the industry is growing fast and will become far larger in the next decade. The industry’s goal is to understand consumers’ needs and recommend products that best satisfy those needs. AI is the most significant growth propellent for this business in year — it enhances consumer experiences, increase sales, and boosts engagement, according to SuperAGI. AI-driven recommendation engines can increase customer loyalty, average order size and the lifetime value of a customer. For example, 71% of consumers are more likely to return to a website offering personalized experiences. Moreover, such systems suggest complementary products — thereby increasing average order value by 10% to 15%, reported SuperAGI. Algolia appears to be riding this growth wave. The company provides an AI-native search and discovery platform to enable brands such as PetSmart, Best Buy, Chewy, Twitch, Stripe, and Under Armour to deliver fast, relevant, and personalized search experiences, according to an Algolia release. Algolia’s search-as-a-service solution uses AI recommendations, NeuralSearch, and real-time personalization to boosts user engagement and increase conversion rates, the release added. Algolia has added many customers in the last five years. “When I joined Algolia we had less than 7,000 customers, now we have 18,000,” Nixon — who joined the company in 2020 — told me. “We process two billion transactions per year and have millions of developers on our platform.” Algolia’s growth can be attributed to its ability to satisfy e-commerce search customers’ need for reliable performance at scale. “We provide five nine’s reliability which means only 26 seconds of downtime per month,” she said. “Reliability is really important and it is difficult to do when operating at scale.” Algolia has repeatedly introduced meaningful innovations. “We disrupted the market three times and we are about to do it a fourth,” Nixon explained. Instead of relying on preexisting search software such as Lucene, Algolia’s search was built from scratch to work on mobile. Next, the company introduced search as a service and charged customers based on the number of searches — with the price per search declining with the number of searches. Finally, in 2023, Algolia introduced hybrid search — “combining keyword and natural language search incorporating large language models,” she told me. Algolia is most excited about agentic AI — which will enable consumers to take action towards a goal. The company uses Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol — which allows AI agents to access Algolia's search, analytics, recommendations, and index configuration APIs. “AI agents must be able to work across walled gardens to traverse a company’s back-end seamlessly to retrieve data,” she said. “To that end, we have partnered with Salesforce Commerce Cloud and Adobe Experience Manager.” Algolia’s customers are benefiting from how much consumers’ use of ChatGPT to search for products is adding to web traffic. “Adobe Analytics has found generative AI is giving retailers and banks 1,200% traffic increases while travel sites are seeing 1,700% increases,” she told me. “When people come to a retailer’s site they bounce 23% less frequently and look at 12% more pages per visit.” Algolia also provides personalized digital shopping guides — say, for Mother’s Day and Valentine’s Day — targeted towards various lifestyles. “In beta test, we have 73 shopping guides already,” she concluded. Google's offerings — notably Google Ads and Vertex AI Search for Commerce — can boost retailer revenues in three ways: In July 2025, Gartner ranked Google and Algolia as Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery leaders based on their completeness of vision and ability to execute. Algolia is the leader among leaders — prevailing over Google. Algolia is proud of Gartner’s recognition. “This is the second year we have been a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Search and Product Discovery,” Nixon told me. “We are up and to the right in the leader box which makes us the best in the industry for completeness of vision and ability to execute. How? We want to make search easy for the masses. We wanted to be scalable in the enterprise. We solve the search puzzle for the masses.” Google was happy to be an MQ leader. “We believe this recognition affirms Google’s evolving commitment to delivering high ROI-generating product discovery, through the use of AI in relevance, ranking, and personalization,” noted Google Cloud AI Director, Product Management Sachin Padwal in a July 8 company release. Algolia is ahead of Google in applying agentic AI for search and product discovery. While Google has not yet launched such a service, on July 11 the search giant acquired executive talent and intellectual property from Windsurf — a leader in agentic AI, noted CNBC. Algolia’s MCP Server — launched in June 2025 — enables LLMs and autonomous agents to work together to help consumers buy what they need more quickly. For example, Algolia’s agentic AI service can help consumers book a Mediterranean cruise. By retrieving relevant consumer information from platforms such as Adobe and Salesforce. For example, Algolia agentic AI service can recommend and book a cruise based on each guest’s chosen destinations, travel history, and other preferences — in milliseconds, according to a company release. “This isn’t about showing off what agents could do,” Nixon said. “It’s about showing what they can do right now with a powerful user experience, if they have the right layer of intelligence underneath. That’s where Algolia fits.” Meanwhile, Google is currently experimenting with agentic AI for travel. Google’s “AI Mode” will be able to “plan full itineraries, remember context, and keep users within the AI interface — even for booking,” noted Hospitality.today. “Google’s Project Mariner” will enable “AI to take actions online -- like booking a hotel or tracking flight prices.” Google stock is 12% undervalued based on the average price target of 37 Wall Street analysts, according to TipRank. If Algolia’s lead over Google in search and product discovery is any indication, those analysts could be too optimistic.

Title: An Unsuspecting Contender - Rocky Mountain's Instinct Powerplay SL Long-Term Review
URL: https://www.vitalmtb.com/product/guide/e-bikes/rocky-mountain/instinct-powerplay-sl-67636
Time Published: 2025-07-12T14:05:13Z
Full Content:
Rocky Mountain probably isn't a brand many riders would expect to develop its own cutting-edge e-bike technology. But back in 2009, they did just that, launching Propulsion Powercycle under the same roof as their Quebec HQ. When they introduced their first model, the Altitude Powerplay, in 2017, the proprietary 108Nm Dyname 3.0 motor quietly took the top spot as the most powerful Class 1 E-bike motor. A title that was only recently relinquished to DJI's latest Avinox system. Seven years later, Rocky Mountain has once again pushed the limits of e-bikes with the 2025 Instinct Powerplay SL—their first delve into the lightweight e-bike category. The Powerplay SL offers 65Nm of torque and 550W of power, combined with a 480Wh battery, in a sub-45 lb package. Progressive suspension, adjustable geometry, and size-specific chainstays position the Instinct Powerplay SL as a capable all-rounder. Six months of testing later, let's get into how Rocky's first lightweight e-model performed and where it stands amongst the deep field of SL bikes. When Rocky Mountain unveiled the Dyname 4.0 motor on the Powerplay Lineup in 2021, there were no major performance gains over the then-four-year-old Dyname 3.0 system. Instead, Rocky focused on refining the system, packing it into a smaller space, reducing noise, and significantly cutting weight by over 15%, all while still delivering class-leading torque and power. This led some riders to wonder what it would look like if Rocky were ever to direct that effort at the SL e-bike category. Three years later, we have the answer. Rocky Mountain built on the lessons learned from the full-sized Dyname motors and synthesized them into the Dyname S4 Lite, a 65Nm, 550W motor that weighs only 5 lbs, available exclusively on the 145mm travel Instinct Powerplay SL. Coming in at only 43 lbs, the Instinct Powerplay SL fits comfortably into the SL e category, which seems to capture everything between 38 and 45 lbs, and does so with more battery and significantly more power than most other options. Size-specific chainstays and shock tunes, a reach-adjust headset, and adjustable geometry suggest that Rocky Mountain isn't just interested in mimicking the weight of a normal bike, but the ride experience as well. Like the rest of the Powerplay lineup, the Instinct SL uses a mid-pivot, four-bar suspension layout and a counter-rotating upper rocker link. Though Rocky has not published much about their kinematics, one can expect a good amount of leverage progression, somewhat neutral antirise, high antisquat, and a small amount of rearward wheel path. An integrated, removable battery surrounded by internal guide tubes for all cables and wires rounds out the basic features. The Instinct Powerplay SL is available in three full-carbon builds, ranging from $7,999 to $11,999, in addition to three aluminum builds priced from $5,499 to $7,999. We tested the Carbon 90 build, which came loaded with FOX Factory suspension, a full Race Face Era kit, handling wheels, bars, and cranks, SRAM Code Ultimate Stealth brakes, and an X0 Eagle Transmission drivetrain. Unlike most e-bikes, the Instinct Powerplay SL uses a BB92 pressfit bottom bracket and traditional cranks. Carbon and aluminum models share the same Dyname S4 Lite motor, integrated display, and geometry adjustments. The Dyname S4 Lite has five modes: Walk, Eco, Trail, Trail+, and Ludicrous. The motor can store three different power presets: Factory, Tune A, and Tune B. Tune A and B are adjustable with options to increase or decrease the assist for each mode, represented as a percentage. There is also a boost setting to configure how sensitive the motor is to rider inputs, which has five modes ranging from -2 (least sensitive, 'heavy workout') to +2 (most sensitive, 'low effort'). All motor configuration takes place on the display and with the mode selector switch. Personally, not having to download or open an app whenever I want to adjust the assist or see the odometer is a huge plus. You can even cycle through all three motor tunes and customize them without stopping. The Instinct SL features adjustable reach via included offset headset cups and adjustable head angle, bottom bracket height, and seat angle via the RIDE-4 chips in the upper shock link. Unlike its analog counterpart, the Instinct Powerplay SL does not feature an adjustable chainstay length. I did not make use of the +/-5mm adjustable reach, but as someone who grew up with chronic small bike syndrome, I appreciated having the option. RIDE-4 is a simplified version of Rocky's near-extinct RIDE-9 adjustment. It offers four geometry settings, taking the head angle from 63.5° to 64.2° and raising the bottom bracket about a centimeter. Four settings to change the head angle by 0.7 ° is excessive, but again, I appreciated having the option. I spent most of my time with the bike in position 3, the second highest/steepest. Allegedly, a mullet link will be available in the future and will be compatible with the SM-XL frames. Assembling the bike was straightforward and pain-free. Home mechanics that opt to have the bike delivered can expect to install the handlebar, front brake, front wheel, and battery, as well as run the cable, and cut the housing for the dropper post. The housing is already run through the frame, and the SRAM Transmission drivetrain is already paired and adjusted. All cables are internally routed with individual guide tubes that end at the base of the battery for easy access. Battery fitment is thoughtful, as it glides past the motor and is secured with two bolts. Aside from swapping out the 20mm rise Race Face Era Carbon handlebar for a more appropriate 40mm version, and eventually the EXO+ MaxxTerra Minion DHF for a DoubleDown MaxxGrip High Roller, the bike was left stock for the duration of the test. Motor Performance The Instinct SL was my first experience with Dyname's motor. Having spent extensive time on TQ's HPR50 and around Specialized's SL 1.2, the S4 Lite motor produced a noise level comparable to that of the HPR50. It does a good job of disappearing into the background with practically no whining or whirring. However, the S4 Lite has a persistent, unpleasant grinding that stems from the motor's integrated upper pulleys. Dyname's motors utilize two pulley wheels that sit above the chainring. One pulley serves as a traditional high-pivot idler, neutralizing chain forces from the suspension. The other monitors the tension between the chainring and pulley, telling the motor how much power to deliver. Both are protected by a small plastic cover that serves to keep out the elements and keep the chain secure on the idler. The pulleys are rough enough that the first ride around the neighborhood actually left a tingling sensation in my feet from the vibrations being transmitted through the pedals. They did wear in fairly quickly, to the point that I stopped noticing it after the first few rides. But the noise never went away and was audible to those around me when cruising on smooth pavement. When pedaling, the S4 Lite responds proportionately to rider input, all the way down to zero input. Unlike TQ's less powerful HPR50, where there seems to be a floor of minimum assistance, the S4 Lite has no such floor—give the motor very little and very little assistance you shall receive in return. This form of power delivery does come with a consequence: resting your foot on the pedal while stopped kills power to the motor and triggers an alert that the motor will eventually need to be recalibrated. Simply unweighting the pedal is enough to get the power back, and recalibration is a one button procedure handled through the onboard display, but that didn’t make it any less annoying. The S4 Lite also had an interesting flaw where the pulley noise and vibration would become increasingly worse as assist or RPM decreased. Pedaling at a low RPM with minimum assistance turned the grinding into an unpleasant clunking that was quite distracting. That quirk, alongside the fact that pedaling mountain bikes with your own legs is hard, discouraged me from dropping the assist below Trail+ (the third-highest assist level). The Instinct SL does have a relatively generous 480Wh battery, dwarfing the 360Wh and 320Wh batteries found on Trek's Fuel EXe and Specialized's SL models and just edging out the 430Wh battery found on Fazua's Ride 60 system. I never experienced any range anxiety. The 480Wh battery even allowed me to complete a 5,000 ft day without ever using Eco mode. The available Overtime 2.0 Range Extender can take the Instinct SL up to a massive 794Wh, which should cover the needs of 99.9% of riders. The Power offered by the motor is exceptional. With a peak power of 550W, the S4 Lite is within spitting distance of many current full-size e-bikes, including Shimano's EP801, which maxes out at 600W. I could join full-size e-bikes on trail climbs and keep up fairly well, though I would expect to get dropped on a sustained fire road climb. Climbing Performance Like most E-bikes ought to be, climbing the Instinct SL is nearly effortless. Its overall low weight, bolstered by EXO+ tires and the carbon Race Face Era wheels, made for a bike that gets up to speed quickly and has no problem maneuvering technical climbs. The 658mm top tube of the XL Instinct was plenty roomy for my 6'2" stature, though I would have happily traded a centimeter or two to bring the seat tube angle up to 79° from 77° as the front of the bike had a tendency to wander on steeper climbs. The rear shock did sink deeper into its travel than I would prefer on technical or rough climbs, leaving me vulnerable to pedal strikes. This occurred with 25% sag. The Float X shock does feature a climb switch, but I found it too firm to be all that useful on anything but roads. Closing the low-speed compression helped, but it made the shock spike on square-edge hits when descending. Ultimately, I ran the shock oversprung to help mitigate pedal strikes and dealt with the consequences otherwise. Descending As soon as I dropped into my first downhill aboard the Instinct SL, it was apparent just how long and balanced the geometry felt. Even when diving into steep corners, I found it easy to keep my weight over the front wheel while maintaining a neutral and upright body position. I had no trouble maneuvering the XL Instinct's 1306mm wheelbase around tight corners, either. The centered riding position made it effortless to unweight the rear wheel without getting the sensation of being in front of the front axle. I attribute this, in part, to the 450mm chainstays found on the L and XL. While 450mm is not huge, that number should start to approach 460mm at sag, thanks to the Instinct's mid-pivot design, contributing to a neutral body position. I would like to see larger jumps between sizes, a la Forbidden, but nonetheless, it beats the hell out of the 430mm chainstays found on most other XL SL e-bikes. The second thing I noticed was the unbalanced compression damping between the fork and shock. Even with Rocky Mountain's size-specific shock tunes, the fork had a noticeably more damped feel than the shock. On longer sections, I would feel my weight progressively shift backward after repeated compressions, requiring a conscious 'reset' to get back in the middle of the bike. I think this could be resolved with a firmer high-speed compression tune on the shock to better match the race feel of the Grip X2 36. I could probably get a more balanced feel by backing off the HSC on the fork, and putting in some volume spacers to maintain the bottom out resistance, but I think I'd be holding the bike back in terms of its descent capabilities. The only time I felt the bike took focus to ride was when resisting front wheel deflections. I found the Grip X2 Fox 36 to not track great over baby head rocks or angled square edge hits. I was able to mitigate this somewhat by replacing the EXO+ casing front tire with a heavier and softer DoubleDown, improving the material damping at the front of the bike.Still, the firm damping of the X2 that encouraged me to take the roughest of straight lines also demanded focus to not get caught out. At $12,000, one would expect the Instinct SL's parts spec not to leave one wanting, and that's mostly the case. The Race Face carbon wheels and cranks performed admirably without issue, the FOX Factory suspension was reliable, and I smashed the X0 Eagle derailleur so hard that I actually heard it move out of the way by like six gears, then reset back in place unaffected. Some riders may prefer heavier casing tires than the EXO+ featured across all build kits. I found them to be plenty durable for my needs, brushing off rock strikes and knife edges that would have ended an EXO casing tire's career. I'm less jazzed about the MaxxTerra compound used for both tires. It's passable for a rear tire but bordering on hazardous as a front tire. I would like to see a firmer tune on the rear shock as well as a rolling change to the new and improved FOX 36 to address the deflection issues I was having. The only component that degraded was the FOX Transfer post, which started getting sticky after just a few rides, struggling to reach full extension. Finally, I had no issues with the SRAM Codes that came on this bike, but in a world where Mavens exist, I'd like to see Mavens specced in the future. $12,000 is a lot of money to spend on a bike, yet somehow the C90 build that was tested is somewhere between average and above average value for the money. An equivalent build of Trek's Fuel EXe will set you back an additional $1,200. The $9,699 Carbon 70 build trades the Factory Grip X2 Suspension for Performance Elite Grip X, retains wireless shifting in the form of GX Transmission, downgrades to Code Silver brakes, and still comes in at a respectable 43.5 lbs. Of all of Rocky Mountain's offerings, the C70 is the one I would choose as a customer. At this price point, the equivalent Fuel EXe 9.8 T-Type comes spec'd with RockShox Select+ suspension and Code R brakes, which I feel is a real performance sacrifice. For me, the heart of the Powerplay SL is the low weight and high power, and while the C50 build does retain that at only 44 lbs, the RockShox Select Suspension, XT brakes, and Novatec wheels diminish the value of the low weight and power. Rocky Mountain does offer a range of aluminum builds, but I have a hard time rationalizing the build kits for anyone looking for solid downhill performance out of the box. The Alloy 70 BC Edition comes in at $8,000 fitted with Select+ suspension, Code Bronze brakes, GX Eagle Transmission, and a weight penalty to the tune of 48.5 lbs. For $200 less, a customer could roll away with a top of the line Commencal Meta Power SX 400 with Factory Grip X2 suspension, SRAM Code brakes, and a much less finicky Bosch SX motor, for practically the same weight. I spent several months on the Instinct SL and never had to tighten so much as a bolt or spoke. An included extra downtube guard should provide any necessary protection on shuttle days, and the motor showed no signs of degenerative wear, including the pulley wheels, despite creaking that suggested otherwise. The reach-adjust headset cup did produce some noise after a few rides. I was initially concerned when I pulled on the headset cup, and it came out by hand, but then I noticed the cup had an O-ring around it, meaning it was likely functioning as intended. I greased up the seal and the frame/cup interface and the noise went away. For a certain subset of riders, the pressfit BB92 bottom bracket will be a turn-off, but I have never had an issue with one. Given Rocky Mountain's financial situation, I would have concerns about being able to find service parts or fulfill a warranty if they were to shut their doors, however, the Instinct Powerplay SL gave no indication that the warranty would be needed. It's also worth mentioning that Dyname has recently updated their website, stating they are no longer exclusive to Rocky Mountain, and are looking for new partners, hinting at some continued motor support should Rocky Mountain close down. Despite the Dyname motor's rough-around-the-edges feeling, I had a blast riding the Instinct Powerplay SL. Progressive geometry, a ton of power, light overall weight, and solid range had me reaching for the bike as much as I could. Perhaps not quite a quiver killer, the Instinct SL held it down under a wide range of trails. It would not be my first choice if I were planning on spending a lot of time at bike parks, however, I'm confident it's up to the task. While I would struggle to encourage anyone to spend $12,000 on any bike, let alone one with the motor issues I encountered, the lower-priced builds can offer more value at a similar weight with specs that should cover most riders' needs, especially those less fussy about suspension performance. If you are searching for a lightweight eMTB that will let you nearly keep up with your friends on full-power bikes without compromising on geometry or riding experience, I would suggest being open to the Instinct Powerplay SL.

Title: Nvidia’s $4 Trillion Valuation Tells A Beautiful Retirement Story
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2025/07/12/nvidias-4-trillion-valuation-tells-a-beautiful-retirement-story/

ByJohn Tamny ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - MARCH 18: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a keynote address during the ... More Nvidia GTC Artificial Intelligence Conference at SAP Center on March 18, 2024 in San Jose, California. The developer conference is expected to highlight new chip, software, and AI processor technology. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Nvidia’s valuation reached the $4 trillion mark this week, while co-founder Jensen Huang’s shares are now worth something like $143 billion. Present and future retirees should rejoice the rapidly increasing wealth inequality that Nvidia and Huang represent. That’s because inequality is the greatest gift to retirement of all. To see why, contemplate the “Magnificent Seven” stocks known to be the biggest drivers of the bull market of the present. Doing so requires a brief look backwards. If you purchased Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla and Nvidia early, you’re presently not worried about having enough money for retirement. Huang was of course at Nvidia in the beginning, and his enormous wealth exists as evidence of what can happen when early investors or employees stay the proverbial course amid immense share-price volatility. Twice in Nvidia’s public life its shares have dropped 90 percent on their way to gains greater than 300,000% to the present. That has been the norm among corporations that make up the Magnificent 7. Lots of ups and downs that the typical retail investor saving for retirement can’t endure. Which is the point. Thanks to index funds and ETFs that track the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100, or for that matter global stock market indices, retirement savers don’t have to be early to transformative business concepts. Much more importantly, they don’t have to pick the shares that will eventually soar. Instead, they merely need to be invested. From there the stock market will not only do their worrying for them, their investment in broad indices ensures that they’ll have growing exposure to the very few corporations that unexpectedly emerge as the bluest of blue chips. That’s why present and future retirees should cheer rising inequality. Exactly because index funds and ETFs are frequently market-cap weighted, ownership of stock indexes evolves to reflect the most highly valued stocks most prominently. That’s where wealth inequality comes in. It’s an effect of entrepreneurs discovering a future of commerce that most never imagined. Since entrepreneurs are much earlier to world-changing and improving ideas than the markets themselves, they capture the majority of market gains from their discovery of what was only obvious after the fact. Still, would-be retirees once again don’t need to be early. They just need to be positioned for exposure to the high-flyers of today and tomorrow through broad market exposure. If so, as in if and when the next commercial visionary happens on a new idea that investors gradually fall in love with, the typical retirement investor stands to prosper substantially thanks to the genius of compounding. The good news is that the potential to compound one’s wealth grows by the day as the world shrinks by the day through commercial advances that reach greater and greater numbers of people. This is wealth inequality, and it’s transforming the quality of retirement for the much better.

Title: Google Search is under attack. Why ChatGPT won’t overthrow it yet.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. While ChatGPT’s meteoric rise in popularity has positioned it to rival to traditional search engines, analysts say the chatbot hasn’t knocked Google out of the top spot just yet. Citi Research analysts led by Ronald Josey reiterated a Buy rating and $203 target price on shares of Alphabet, Google’s parent, on Friday. The stock was down slightly at $177.18 in morning trading. Citi polled 2,400 Google Search users in the U.S. and found that the search engine “remains core to most users’ Internet usage." The same conclusion held true across all age groups, Citi said. Still, the bank cited a rise in “alternative search experiences" among young users, naming ChatGPT and Meta Platforms’ Facebook and Instagram as examples. ChatGPT has become the “go-to" destination for younger users, with Google usage rising with age, Citi said. While 85% of respondents selected Google as their “core search engine," with 72% saying Google was their first site to search online, differences emerged among age groups. Among users aged 41 to 55, 88% of respondents named Google as their core search engine, but that number dipped to 83% for respondents aged 14 to 24. With that being said, the use of AI agents appears to be “more research-driven than commercial," as opposed to Google Search, where shopping was ranked as the top use case among respondents, Citi said. And the bank believes there’s more to love about Google’s growth story, as responses indicated that the use of other features such as Shopping and Travel continued to accelerate. Overall, the results suggest that Google Search is standing its ground for now, which is good news for Alphabet. Revenue attributed to Google Search and other services accounted for more than half of the total in the latest quarter. Google is set to report second-quarter results on July 23. Based on Citi’s preliminary analysis, “we believe the broader online advertising environment, including search and YouTube, is healthy," the analysts wrote. Other firms have sounded the alarm about AI and its effects on Google Search. However, Citi believes the search engine’s advertising market improved throughout the quarter. Earnings will put that theory to the test. Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks. It'll just take a moment.

Title: Opinion: Talking Point This Week: Trade Tensions, Tariff Jitters Dictate Newsflow
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/trade-tensions-donald-tariff-jitters-q1-earnings-talking-point-this-week
Time Published: 2025-07-11T18:31:43Z
Full Content:
This week was marked by trade tensions and tariff newsflow, with barbs being exchanged between the US and Brazil. Dollar was steady, but Bitcoin surged to levels not seen before. There were other news, including results flow in India as well as corporate developments. In corporate news, Delta Air Lines soared on strong quarterly results and a raised outlook, while WK Kellogg's shares jumped on reports of a $3 billion acquisition by Ferrero Group. Meanwhile, the EU is urgently seeking a trade deal with the US to avert further tariffs, and the UAE was formally removed from the EU's high-risk list for money laundering. Here are the key talking points this week: Trade Tensions The Biggest Event Global trade tensions just got a whole lot worse! The US is leading the charge with a slew of new tariff announcements that are sparking outrage worldwide. Canada's getting slammed with a 35% tariff on a bunch of imports, effective Aug. 1, because the US claims they're not doing enough to stop fentanyl trafficking. And that's not all - over 20 other countries are in the crosshairs, with tariffs ranging from 15% to 20%. Brazil's getting hit with a whopping 50% tariff, and copper imports are facing a 50% tariff. The US is also threatening a 200% tariff on pharma imports if companies don't move production to the US. This is all about "reciprocal tariffs," but it feels like a full-on trade war. Affected countries are already vowing to fight back and protect their workers, naturally so. Expert Opinion S Naren's insight that "every stock is discovered" reflects India's maturing stock market, where intense competition among brilliant stock pickers has left few undervalued opportunities, pushing investors toward contrarian picks in hated sectors like oil and gas, supported by a 2023 study from the National Bureau of Economic Research showing market efficiency increases with analyst density. The shift from value to momentum investing in a late-cycle economy aligns with historical patterns; a 2021 Journal of Finance study found momentum strategies outperform value strategies by 6% annually in late economic cycles, a trend potentially amplified by India's current earnings revisions and strong domestic flows. Conversation with Sajjid Chinoy and Chetan Ahya suggest that Asia will have to brace for a slowdown, and that may make it difficult for higher growth countries like India to deliver growth too. The lone ranger was JP Morgan's Rajiv Batra, whose note suggests that this quarter will serve as a transition from underwhelming earnings to a decent recovery, driven by the low base from the previous year and a resurgence in economic momentum. Batra expects the Nifty to trade at a level between 26,500-30,000 in the next 6-9 months. When It Rains, It Pours The week had a lopsided newsflow, with the second half standing true to the adage that 'when it rains, it pours'. TCS beat earnings expectations with a better than expected delivery in net profit, but a sluggish revenue growth and a wobble around demand. CEO K Krithivasan is optimistic about new services and deal wins, despite global economic uncertainty. And this weighed in on the stock price, with the IT index coming off for three days on a trot. Meanwhile, Hindustan Unilever is shaking things up with Priya Nair set to become the first female CEO and MD in the company's 92-year history. And Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is celebrating a massive $2 billion deal with AbbVie for its cancer treatment, with a cool $700 million upfront payment. The stock has gained 25% this month, with a 15% move coming in post the announcement. Assumptions Of Dollar Dominance Forever, Are Shaky The past 25 years has seen the UK, France and US issue far too much debt, which Asian countries stacked up in their foreign exchange reserves out of fear for a new Asian crisis. The next question is whether this imbalance can endure. And, if not, how will it be resolved. The answer to the first question is increasingly obvious: Asian countries are becoming ever less fond of US treasuries, gilts and OATs. So what happens next? History shows that such imbalances usually spur an important shift in the value of exchange rates. The country that has issued too many bonds sees its currency fall, while the one that has saved too much sees its currency re-rate. Imagine what will happen to the dollar ahead! Lastly, a (not so) personal question. Fed up with your paycheck? How does $200 million-plus sound? As per a Bloomberg article, that’s what Meta is apparently paying Ruoming Pang, who used to run Apple’s AI models team. More importantly, it is in line with the compensation of other members of Meta’s new “superintelligence” group. Why is this happening? Well, we know AI is all pervasive. But there are minds like Eric Schmidt who believe that the AI revolution is 'underhyped'. If this is an indication that you are assuming that it is overhyped, maybe you should rethink your estimates or assumptions. Have a great weekend. Until Next Time... Niraj Shah

Title: Preorder NOW to get Meta's Limited Edition Oakley smart glasses before everyone else

These 24K gold-accented glasses arrive July 22 but could easily sell out before then; the rest of the Meta Oakley collection arrive later this summer. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has launched preorders for its Meta Oakley HSTN Warm Gray Prizm 24K Polarized smart glasses, the first version of these glasses available. And given how quickly they're likely to sell out, you'll want to grab them while you still can! This is Meta's second Limited Edition launch in recent days, after the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition that sold out quickly on many retail sites. So far, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are only available on Meta, and there's no saying how much stock is available or if resellers will snag them all. You can wait until "later this summer" for the other HSTN frames — Desert with Ruby lenses, Black with Polar Black, Shiny Brown with Polar Deep-Water, Black with Transitions Amethyst, or Clear with Transitions Grey — and spend only $399, but without the gold accents. The Meta Oakley HSTN glasses offer portable Meta AI insights, a built-in 12MP ultrawide camera with 3024 X 4032 resolution photos, open-ear speakers, IPX4 water resistance, and eight hours of battery life — double what the Ray-Ban Meta glasses offer. This limited-edition version comes with gold accents and isn't likely to stay in stock for long! These striking Meta AI glasses measure 147 mm hinge-to-hinge or 158mm temple length, with no alternate sizes, so check your current glasses to see if they'll fit you well. Meta also doesn't seem to be selling a prescription version of the Limited Edition glasses, unfortunately. They confirmed to us that the $399 glasses pairs will be "Rx-ready" with -6.00 to +4.00 lens power, so you may want to skip this Limited Edition if you want to add some clarity to your AI glasses. If you compare the Meta Oakley HSTNs vs. the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, these Oakley glasses have faster charging, higher video resolution at 3K vs. 1080p, and double the battery life at eight hours. That last point is what makes these Meta Oakley glasses so compelling: They're much less likely to die on you during an all-day outing, especially if you use battery-burning features like Meta AI. We'd hoped that Amazon Prime Day would bring prices down on Ray-Ban Meta glasses, but they've remained stubbornly full price, up to $379. So the price gap between these and the Ray-Bans isn't that great, considering the golden flourishes that Oakley and Meta added. Overall, these Meta Oakley HSTN Limited Edition glasses are striking with their gold finishes and light frames, but some people will prefer to wait for models that aren't quite as flashy, or grab one of the cheaper Ray-Ban models for $299. Alternatively, you can wait for the third-gen Ray-Ban glasses that leaked yesterday, which are rumored to feature a battery boost.

Title: U.S. stocks move lower and pull S&P 500 back from its record

Alex Veiga, Associated Press Alex Veiga, Associated Press Leave your feedback U.S. stocks are down in morning trading Friday, pulling the market back from all-time highs, as the Trump administration escalates its tariff threats against Canada. The S&P 500 was down 0.4% a day after setting a record high. The benchmark index is on pace to post its first weekly loss in three weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 279 points, or 0.6%, as of 11:06 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% lower a day after climbing to an all-time high. Both indexes are also headed for weekly losses. Bond yields rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.40%, from 4.34% late Thursday. Trump said in a letter Thursday that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening the rift between the longtime North American allies. The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March. The move is the latest bid by the White House to use threats of higher tariffs on goods imported into the U.S. in hopes of securing new trade agreements with countries around the globe, even historically close trading partners like Canada. The administration had initially set Wednesday as a deadline for countries to make deals with the U.S. or face heavy increases in tariffs. But with just two trade deals announced since April, one with the United Kingdom and one with Vietnam, the window for negotiations has been now been extended to Aug. 1. Trump also floated this week that he would impose tariffs of as much as 200% on pharmaceutical drugs and placed a 50% tariff on copper imports, matching the rates charged on steel and aluminum. The initial rollout of Trump’s tariff policies in the spring roiled financial markets. But Wall Street has been relatively stable in recent weeks, with stocks steadily rising to record levels, suggesting the market has mostly adjusted to the unpredictability of Trump’s rapidly shifting tariffs. Trade policy aside, the market is now set to shift at least some of its focus on companies due to report quarterly earnings over the next few weeks. On Friday, Levi Strauss jumped 10.9% after the jeans maker easily beat Wall Street’s sales and profit targets and raised its full-year forecast, despite expecting higher costs from tariffs. PriceSmart climbed 6.6% a day after the warehouse club operator delivered solid third-quarter results and said it’s looking into expanding into Chile. Earnings season shifts into high gear next week with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Citigroup among the big banks due to report their results on Tuesday. Wall Street analysts predict that companies in the S&P 500 will deliver 5% growth in second-quarter earnings, according to FactSet. That would mark the lowest rate since the fourth quarter of 2023. Shares in financial sector, health care and communication services companies were the biggest weights on the market Friday. Visa fell 1.5%, Gilead Sciences dropped 3.2% and Meta was 1.8% lower. Some big tech stocks rose. Chimpaker Nvidia was up 1.8%. Several airline stocks were down a day after encouraging quarterly results from Delta Air Lines set off a rally in the sector. Delta dropped 2.4%, United fell 3.9% and American was 4.1% lower. Elsewhere in the market, shares of T-Mobile slipped 0.6% after the Justice Department announced Thursday that it would not prevent the company from closing on its proposed $4.4 billion acquisition of U.S. Cellular. That deal, announced more than a year ago, had come under antitrust scrutiny from the Justice Department under President Joe Biden’s administration. U.S. Cellular shares rose 2.7%. Shares in aviation company Red Cat Holdings jumped 17.8% after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued orders aimed at ramping up production and deployment of drones. European stock indexes were broadly lower following a mostly lower finish in Asian markets. Meanwhile, bitcoin climbed to another all-time high Friday, briefly eclipsing $118,000 before easing back to around $117,800, according to Coindesk. Bitcoin’s price jump came amid bullish momentum across risk assets and coincides with Nvidia’s surge to a $4 trillion valuation. It also comes days before the U.S. Congress’ Crypto Week on July 14, where lawmakers will debate a series of bills that could define the regulatory framework for the industry.

Stocks opened mixed amid the tariff deadline set by U.S. President Donald Trump as his administration awaits for countries willing to negotiate.

Title: I'm Done with Social Media
URL: https://www.carolinecrampton.com/im-done-with-social-media/
Time Published: 2025-07-11T15:00:36Z
Full Content:
I started last year with one clear goal: 2024 was going to be the year that I finally did social media. Regular posting, a content calendar, a strategy, a plan for growth — all of that. And yet I ended the year pretty certain that I never wanted to open those apps again, let alone post my photos and words to them. How? My main motivation for wanting to conquer my long-held ambivalence about posting was because I had a book coming out in April 2024. I was very anxious about this, in part because A Body Made of Glass was not an obviously easy sell. There are a few reasons for that: it blends several genres in a hard-to-categorise way, it tackles a subject in which I am not a well-known or previously published expert, and it is highly personal. It had also, in quite a modest way, done well according to the nebulous pre-publication benchmarks that authors obsess over. It had attracted a "Big Five" publisher in the US, something I had not had before, received a BBC radio serialisation deal in the UK, and had received some decent early reviews from industry publications in both places. I felt I should be leaving no stone unturned to support the book's success, since I had been gifted opportunities that many other writers would love to have. Chances, too, that I may never have again. There are very few things that an author can practically do to make a book a success, especially after said book is written, edited and printed. Being a celebrity or personality with a pre-existing audience that adores you definitely helps, but isn't something you can suddenly decide to become four months before your publication date. Catching a particular trend or moment that causes publishers to invest heavily in promotion and booksellers to place large early orders is great too, but once the book is done that's up to them, not you. Giving off that nebulous aura of "I'm about to become a huge literary success" that seems to cling to some people and not others would be good as well, but is also pretty hard to engineer deliberately if that's not your personality or presentation (and it isn't mine). In that tense, quiet period after the book has been finalised but before anyone can buy or read it, augmenting your personal brand via the regular use of social media feels like the only concrete action you can take. Or at least it did to me, so I threw myself into it. I attended some training sessions on "social media for authors". I asked professional acquaintances with expertise for tips. I learned that Instagram and TikTok were the best platforms to target for bookish followers and that the algorithms of these platforms were, these days, only interested in vertical videos. I compiled lists of videos I could make and started filming mostly-daily updates about my experience as an author with a book coming out soon. I scoured the accounts of other authors who were more successful than me on social media for insights. I posted about every tiny bit of publicity my book got or small win I achieved. I asked people to pre-order in as many ways as I could think of. I delved into the analytics, searching for ways to optimise and improve. I spent a lot of time scrolling, and scrolling, and scrolling, hunting for the "one weird trick" that would help me make a success of this. I quickly began to feel quite uncomfortable. I'm not a natural on camera and I don't have that talent for talking effortlessly and engagingly to a lens when alone in a room that successful social media personalities need. I was forcing it all the time, making myself record multiple takes and doing things again and again until they looked "natural" (a highly unnatural behaviour). My video editing skills are basic, so turning out regular videos took me a long time. Worst of all, though, was the way in which this enterprise began to alter my mindset about the normal stuff of life. I never used to think very hard about what I wore for a casual day of writing at home, or worry about how clean the bathroom mirror was, or obsess over what narrative or story might emerge from my general jumble of accumulated tasks. It shocked me how quickly I started viewing my own life as something to film and share, rather than something to just... live. I've seen this effect described as "the devil had taken my eyes" and I feel that is accurate. Something had taken over my gaze and it wasn't something good. A new and sinister lens had appeared between me and the world. One evening, as I made my husband walk our dog past the same scenic view multiple times so that I could get the best shot of it for a video, I experienced a sudden wave of revulsion for myself and what I was doing. From then on, I began to despise the way this supposedly necessary aspect of modern authorship was intruding on parts of me that I had never meant to be available for public consumption. Worst of all, perhaps, it didn't even seem to be doing anything. The TikTok and Instagram algorithms were utterly disinterested in what I was posting. Some of my existing followers saw my videos and interacted with them, but the promise that this kind of regular video posting would expose my work to lots of new potential readers was never fulfilled. Instagram's analytics showed that although I had a couple of thousand followers, only a few hundred of them were even seeing what I was posting. On Twitter, where I had nearly ten thousand followers that had mostly been accumulated during my previous work as a political journalist, the figures were even worse. Most of my TikToks barely made it to views in three figures. Clearly, I was doing it wrong. But how? I couldn't find any answers, although there's a seemingly inexhaustible supply of information out there on this topic. Everyone in this space seemed to publicly agree that "social media was really important for book promotion" and pointed to the viral success of various books on BookTok, but nobody was able to go into more detail about how this was achieved, or if it was even applicable to a non-fiction book by a non-celebrity author. When I tried to explore this world, it seemed to me like the old-fashioned word-of-mouth effect was just being channeled through a new medium. Books mostly weren't gaining momentum on TikTok because their authors were making top notch viral videos, but because readers and bookish influencers were recommending them to each other and posting about their experiences. It was the quality of the book, the canny distribution of advance reading copies and marketing materials by publishers, and the work's ability to speak to a moment that made the difference. I didn't really see how my own social media activities could fit into this ecosystem. People would either find and like the book, or they wouldn't. Did I even need to be there? Every time I posted, I felt worse. From the outside, my attempts to "do" social media seriously probably looked inconsequential, but they consumed a major portion of my thoughts. What I was doing felt inauthentic and, as the book came out and started getting reviews, like boasting for no reason other than to boast. The choppy nature of the algorithms meant that there was no consistent community on these apps with whom I was sharing my progress through the publishing process and no guarantee even that those were interested would see what I was sharing. When I did in-person events about the book and spoke to readers over the signing table, they would tell me that they had come because they had liked my first book, or enjoyed my current podcast, Shedunnit, or had been a fan of my old one, SRSLY. One person drove several hours to see me at a literary festival because I had put a link to the event in a postscript in my sporadic email newsletter. Nobody I met had been motivated by what I had been doing on social media, even though making those posts had been consuming the vast majority of the time and effort I had to devote to book promotion. This is anecdotal data, for sure, but so much of how the success or otherwise of a book is defined is vibes-based that I felt fine about allowing it to inform me. It only backed up what the social media platforms' analytics had been telling me, anyway. By the mid point of last year my book had been out for a couple of months and the expectation to market it as much as possible was dying away. My anxiety simmered down to the point where I could assess matters more objectively. This was situation as I saw it: I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work. There had also been negative side effects in the form of vastly increased screen time and that disagreeable mental habit of seeing my entire existence as potential posts. There was only one possible conclusion: social media was not for me. More than that, I felt that there was something of an "emperor's new clothes" situation at work. Being a social media star is a skillset completely distinct from being someone who writes books — they may overlap occasionally, but it's not the norm. Yet I suspect that every non-celebrity and midlist author will have felt the pressure at some point to "be more active on social media" because otherwise they aren't "pulling their weight" for their book. I wasn't alone in finding that the effort:reward ratio was entirely out of whack, either. Plenty of peers that I spoke to with online creative businesses were happy to share their experiences of withdrawing partially or fully from social media (for all sorts of reasons including harassment, burnout and parenting) only to find that their sales were largely or even entirely unaffected the next time they had a project to promote. One had closed an account with a following in the six figures and switched to communicating with customers only via an email newsletter, and business was even better than before (likely because all of those subscribed were actually receiving the emails they had signed up for). I began to wonder. Was this all, in fact, nonsense? The publishing industry is going through a period of great volatility at the moment, for many reasons including but not limited to rising production costs, encroaching celebrity culture, corporate greed and the advent of AI. Traditional publicity opportunities like television/radio interviews and print reviews are becoming less and less effective at getting the word out about books as fewer people tune in. The digital alternatives have, so far, not offered a like for like replacement for the old marketing ecosystem. From my perspective as a traditionally-published, non-celebrity author, it feels like nobody really knows what makes a book sell anymore. I think the persistent advice to authors to "do social media" is, at best, part of a strategy that can be generously described as throwing everything at the proverbial wall in the hope that something, anything, will stick. Being more cynical, I think it might sometimes be a way of keeping authors quiet, of transferring the responsibility for their book's success on to their shoulders and occupying them doing something that feels productive so they don't ask too many awkward questions. It's busy work. That's all without considering the role of the platforms themselves in this. I spent several months last year feeling grim about the amount of free content I had uploaded to platforms owned by the likes of Meta and Elon Musk. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok — these are all outlets that purport to capture and manipulate their users' attention, meaning that, as a "creator", if you catch the wave of the algorithm just right you can surf it all the way to a huge following, then fame and fortune. I don't doubt that the select few who make this equation work for them do get well paid for their work once they become successful. Everyone else, though, is just uploading for free so that there is enough stuff on the app to keep users scrolling forever. Infinite scroll means infinite ad inventory. The platforms also invest in promoting the idea that being a "full time creator" is an attainable goal and incentivise their top creators to sell the idea that anyone can achieve their success, if they just start now and work really hard for nothing as long as is necessary. The more I thought about it, the harder it became not to view the so-called creator economy as a blatant pyramid scheme underwritten by some of the worst corporations in the world. The way to succeed is to get in early, then become an aspirational figure to those who come along later. I'm being deliberately blunt to make my point. If you enjoy watching happy videos of dogs and uploading pictures of your holidays for your friends, I'm delighted for you. If making videos and sharing them online is your hobby, all power to you. As part of a viable creative career, though, where a living wage and sustainable workload is the goal, social media now feels to me like a long con that just hasn't been exposed yet. I've never been a whole-hearted lover of social media, nor a great adept at it. I only signed up for Facebook at university because it was necessary for being involved in the student newspaper, and then I deleted my account a few years later when I had a scary experience with a stalker. I rejoined when I moved out of London, naively believing it would help me make new local friends, which it did not. I got Twitter when someone on my journalism training course laughed at me because I didn't already have an account and then almost never posted on it, even when the platform was at its dizzying heights of relevance for those in the media. I once went mildly viral for a snarky tweet during a televised election debate and found the experience so horrifying that I never wanted to repeat it. Instagram was better, for a while — my corner of it was mostly friends and dogs and knitting — but then the feed became algorithmic instead of chronological and I almost never saw the things I liked in a sensible order. Social media was never a wholly cosy or useful place for me, although I was utterly addicted to it for a number of years because "being a journalist" in the 2010s felt synonymous with "being on social media all the time". This idea was so deeply rooted in me that when I worked somewhere with such terrible computers that they couldn't even handle refreshing a Twitter feed, I bought an iPad with my own money so that I could have a device next to me all day that was continually showing the latest posts. At the time, I barely made more than the London Living Wage, rent took three quarters of my monthly pay after tax, and I walked an hour to work every day because I couldn't afford to take the Tube. In those circumstances, buying an expensive tablet just so I never had to be separated from the latest tweets is absurd, even irresponsible. And yet I did it, because I had utterly internalised the idea that social media was the route to writing success. Years later, even knowing what I now knew, it took months to work myself up to quitting and even longer to say out loud what I had done and why. Once I had made up my mind to mentally uncouple myself from social media, it was shockingly easy to do. I deleted the apps from my phone and changed the passwords to my accounts, recording them somewhere inconvenient so that I could log in via the desktop versions if necessary but it took more than a couple of taps or clicks. A few weeks in, I took stock of what I felt like I was missing and the list was surprisingly short: Taylor Swift content, chats with friends, the occasional funny picture of a dog. I replaced all of these pretty easily: I signed up to a couple of music podcasts and Patreons, made an effort to be more regular about phoning and texting people, and just enjoyed the dogs that I saw out and about in the world. The benefits were just as quick to come. That feeling of seeing the world only as potential future content receded, I started reading more books, and my screen time fell drastically. I felt released from a burden I hadn't noticed I was carrying. I had become so accustomed to the sense of shame at not being better at offering up my life for successful consumption that I only realised how acute that feeling had been now that it was gone. I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop, for someone very influential in my industry to swoop down and reprimand me for my actions, to declare that I had irrevocably failed at "being a writer". But nothing bad happened. At all. Those apps had become so barren of joy or purpose for me that I didn't miss the experience of being on them, either as a creator or a user, at all. By the end of the year, packaging chunks of myself to share on questionable corporate platforms for strangers to watch and judge felt like a really weird thing to do. I talked about it in therapy and imagined trying to explain this practice to my eleven-year-old self who had really wanted to spend her life writing stories. The more time that passes, the odder it feels that I spent a decade and a half of my life believing that social media was a vital part of being a writer. Others may have different experiences, but because I was never a consummate poster I never received work opportunities or made friends or found a partner through these apps. Maybe if I had, I would feel like there had been more of a fair exchange. I just allowed them to occupy a large chunk of my brain for nothing. Where does this leave me? I ended 2024 absolutely sure that social media was not for me, a complete reversal of my position at the start of the year. I'm not moving to the woods and throwing my phone in the bin, though. Beyond the reassuringly steady drip of Taylor Swift videos, there was one overarching benefit to being active on social media as a writer that I want to retain, and that is having a way to be in touch with those who are interested in my work. I've spent most of 2025 so far working out what that might look like. I still like the internet and what it can do for us — quite honestly, I don't think I would have a job at all without it — but I want to use it on my terms and in a way that feels good for me rather than harmful. If that means that my potential audience is much smaller, so be it. After much reflection during, I have come to realise that I'd rather talk to a small number of people and be happy doing it than try to reach a huge audience but be miserable. I started small, making the change for my podcast. I did a "farewell" post on the show's accounts and replaced them with an enhanced email newsletter. I expected some pushback and braced myself for a dip in listenership, which I decided that I was willing to accept as the price I paid for independence and greater peace of mind. Neither materialised. I received lots of supportive messages from people with their own growing reservations about social media. The podcast's newsletter now has more active subscribers than we ever had followers. There has been no discernible fall in audience, vindicating my suspicions that our posts hadn't really been doing anything to direct people away from the apps and towards the podcast anyway. Best of all, I'm enjoying writing to the podcast's listeners every week. I am no longer guiltily pushing the "do podcast social media" tasks to the bottom of my to do list all the time. Taking this step for the podcast first has allowed me to come to some decisions about my personal internet presence, too. I have realised that I only want to post on a platform where I have control, with no algorithms or anything else coming between me and the people who want to see what I'm doing. I'm a writer and I think in paragraphs and chapters, not in videos or captions. I think it's about time I played to my strengths, rather than trying to fit myself into a format that I've never found to be comfortable. So, I decided to add a blog to my website and that will now be my home on the internet[1]. I gave it a tagline that hopefully reflects this new stage of my online life: "A blog by a writer attempting to live the literary good life on the internet". Because that's what I'm trying to do now. The quality of the life now is more important than any potential reward in the future. Although the blog will be the main home for all my stuff (you can follow it via RSS and I think you should, because RSS is possibly the best and purest tech we still have) I'll still be sending some posts out as newsletters too. Personal essays where I think out loud (like this one), my Thursday links round up, reading reflections, and a new series I'm about to start titled "Caroline Writes a Novel" (!). Because lots of people have been in touch to say they miss the photos of my dog I used to post on Instagram, there will be a sporadic "photo diary" mail out too where Morris will feature heavily. If you'd like to receive those you can sign up here, or if you already subscribe you can use this menu to adjust which types of posts you receive. I have no plans at the moment to put up a paywall or make extra premium content, but I do have the subscription feature turned on so if anyone really wants to make a financial contribution, they can. I must stress that you won't receive any extra material or benefits if you do so. For now, this is a Medici-style "patron of the arts" situation. Everything is free for everyone, supported by those who have the means and desire to do so. I also want to stress that I absolutely do not need your contributions for basic necessities or survival — this is just a way for those who can to support work that they like if they so choose. There's also an option for a one-off tip if you feel inclined to give one. You should feel no pressure or obligation to do so, though. If you're more into a "extra content for a fee" model, then you might want to consider joining the paid membership element of my podcast. If all of this — a non-famous writer with a podcast deciding she's replacing Instagram with blogging — feels too inconsequential to write 4,500 words about, then you're not alone. I think so too, but I also couldn't not write this. In fact, I've been tapping away at a draft of this post for months, trying to get my feelings about it straight. I might be well on the way to breaking the habit of reflexively viewing the world around me as possible nuggets of content, but even after the somewhat bruising experience of putting out two autobiographical books, I still think best with my fingers on a keyboard and a publication date in mind. In this instance, I do feel like I'm answering a question nobody has asked, though. I think quite regularly about the, at the time very funny, ebook that Grace Dent published in 2011 titled How to Leave Twitter: My Time as Queen of the Universe and Why This Must Stop, in which she lampooned her own social media addiction and the absurd phenomenon of too-online people with tiny followings grandiloquently announcing that they wouldn't be online for the next three hours. What is this, if not that? It feels fitting, though, to mark the end of this chapter in a needlessly performative way. Even though I was terrible at posting, I did spend fifteen years watching human behaviour evolve on these platforms. It was bound to rub off on me a bit. I still don't know if I will delete my old social media accounts. I want to, because it feels more final that way, more like a definitive statement about who I am now and what I am doing. Maybe that's why I shouldn't, though. That was a version of me too, the one who agonised over every angle and caption, who couldn't see the light hitting the water just so without imagining Instagram's square frame around it, who believed that all her dreams would come true if she could just crack Meta's code. She was trying her best, just like I am now. She can live on as a ghost in that machine for now, a bodiless reminder of an existence I never really had. For those who might be wondering why I'm not starting a Substack, it's because I don't like Substack as a company or the direction their platform seems to be headed in (I was there for Facebook's "pivot to video" and I remember who it screwed over). I'm using Ghost, a non-profit website and newsletter platform, and I'm very happy with it. I'd highly recommend it. ↩︎

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/DV or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) AES Corp.(NYSE:AES) is not usually a stock that makes headlines for significant price fluctuations, but investors were startled this week when it increased almost 20% in just one session on Wednesday. So, what is the reason for this sudden interest? It all comes down to discussions of a potential acquisition. As per reports from Bloomberg and other outlets, AES is reportedly considering strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of the company. Such news typically captures investors' attention—particularly when major players like Blackstone, Brookfield, and BlackRock’s infrastructure division are speculated to be involved. While AES stock has experienced volatility, if you're looking for upside with less risk than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative – having outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. However, this is not solely about merger and acquisition speculation. AES has a significant role in the clean energy transition, providing renewable energy to major tech firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta. With the demand for energy from AI data centers and cloud computing soaring, AES's assets appear much more valuable. Despite recently encountering challenges—like reduced subsidies for renewable initiatives due to changing U.S. policies—the long-term demand narrative remains strong. In essence, merger chatter + AI-driven energy demand = investor enthusiasm. Regardless of whether the buyout rumors materialize or not, AES has just reminded the market that it might deserve a closer examination. Not fond of the unpredictable nature of AES stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has demonstrated a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. What is the reason for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have offered superior returns with less risk when compared to the benchmark index; a smoother experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Going cheap on AI talent is no way to achieve leadership: Let’s learn from Meta

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. With Meta offering up to $100 million as sign-up bonuses to hire artificial intelligence (AI) talent, it has set the new global price of intelligence. Across the US and China, compensation for top talent in AI, quantum computing and other strategic technologies has decoupled entirely from traditional salary frameworks. What was once considered an executive-level package is now being paid to domain specialists, engineers and scientists. In India, we speak confidently of becoming global champions in AI, semiconductors and battery innovation. But are we ready to pay for the talent required to get us there? Also Read: Star chase: Why Mark Zuckerberg is deploying billions to acquire hot AI talent like Alexandr Wang for Meta Corporate India, particularly its promoter-led enterprises, still has a rigid compensation culture. Even the most admired Indian tech companies rarely exceed $1 million in fixed compensation for high-end domain talent, preferring to offer stock or deferred incentives instead. Across the board, executive pay continues to outpace technical pay by a wide margin—even in companies that market themselves as product-first. Imagine a promoter approving even a tenth of Meta’s figure—say, $10 million annually—for a single hire in AI. HR would instinctively reach for the cost-to-company (CTC) template. Legal teams would load the contract with clawbacks and non-competes. And someone around the table would inevitably ask whether this was more than the entire tech team earns. This reflects a discomfort with the idea that a young knowledge-led mind—often without pedigree, polish or deference—could command industrial-level value. It is a problem of culture. Indian businesses have long been comfortable investing $50 million in a new factory or plant. But offering even $5 million to a knowledge architect who can design the core of a future-facing product feels excessive. This inversion, where management is rewarded more than the minds building the product, is one of Indian technology’s least acknowledged handicaps. It’s not because the talent doesn’t exist. India continues to produce some of the best AI researchers, quantum physicists and deep tech engineers in the world. But our systems expect them to settle for prestige, purpose or passion. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: India’s IT firms have a unique opportunity in AI’s trust deficit There’s a persistent myth that because India’s tech talent is “mission-driven" and that it will accept under-compensation in return for vision or national pride. That might work if you’re a global frontrunner offering unmatched exposure. But when that same talent has offers from research labs in Silicon Valley, Zurich or Singapore—with salaries 8 to 100 times higher—purpose alone won’t bridge the gap. Vision must be paired with valuation: Across the world, many governments and corporations understand this. The UAE has appointed a minister for AI. Singapore offers co-funded AI fellowships with public-private partnerships. Germany’s AI strategy includes billions in subsidies tied to industrial research teams. These are economic bets on the future of productivity. India’s response so far has been largely declarative: strategies, mission and some funding. But talent doesn’t read these documents. It reads offers, options and opportunities. Also Read: Manu Joseph: Why nobody talks about India’s ‘brain drain’ anymore There is precedent for bold compensation in India’s business history. Two decades ago, during the retail boom, one of India’s largest conglomerates hired 15-plus marquee CEOs at salaries reportedly several times higher than their previous pay. It was a bold bet—one that catalyzed knowledge transfer, global systems and new processes. But once the infrastructure was built, the appetite for such talent faded. The notion that talent is fungible took root again. In deep tech sectors, that assumption won’t hold. In the technology era, talent must be treated as strategic capital expenditure. Hiring a world-class AI researcher is like the first kilometre of pipeline in a new industrial system. Yet, most Indian promoters would find it ego-challenging to write that check unless the individual’s value could be directly tied to revenues already realized, or probably the talent is in their bloodline. That mindset is precisely what could cost us the future. Also Read: Beware India Inc., headhunters are poaching your talent for themselves It’s no longer sufficient to celebrate Indian-origin AI leaders at DeepMind, Google or OpenAI. If we underpay the very talent we claim to revere, we aren’t reversing brain drain—we’re subsidizing innovation elsewhere. And the problem runs deeper than compensation structures. Indian business culture still places enormous symbolic value on control, lineage and loyalty. It’s far more comfortable rewarding long-term insiders than investing aggressively in external experts. But deep tech respects none of these traditional codes. It rewards only edge. The question is not whether India has the financial bandwidth but whether it has the emotional maturity to accept that true capability may reside in those who don’t conform to existing hierarchies. Even India’s startup ecosystem hasn’t escaped this gravity. Founders flush with venture capital hesitate to offer globally competitive salaries to specialist talent. Many prefer to overhire generalists rather than back one game-changing domain expert. Performance-linked employee stock options are useful but they’re no substitute for upfront recognition of value. The test of the new economy is not regulation, nor market access. It isn’t equity capital either—these are traditional entry barriers that large Indian firms are comfortable overcoming. The real question is whether they can recognize that in a world of knowledge-driven industries, intellect is infrastructure. The question then is no longer whether we can afford to pay top talent. It is whether we can afford not to. The author is a corporate advisor and author of ‘Family and Dhanda’ Download the Mint app and read premium stories Log in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Title: Valuation Check: Is Nvidia still a buy after the surge?

Nvidia’s stock closed at $164.10 on Thursday, gaining 0.75% during the day. This pushed the chipmaker’s total market value to $4.004 trillion, marking the first time it ended a trading session above this milestone. With this, Nvidia has extended its lead over tech giants Apple and Microsoft, reinforcing its dominance in the AI-driven tech rally. (Source: Reuters) Nvidia’s high-performance processors are central to the AI infrastructure being built by major tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms. These firms are investing heavily in artificial intelligence data centres, and Nvidia's chips are powering much of that transformation, making the company a key enabler in the ongoing AI revolution. After reaching a $1 trillion market capitalisation in June 2023, Nvidia has tripled its value in just about a year—a feat unmatched by even the largest tech firms. Microsoft is currently valued at $3.73 trillion, while Apple, impacted by slower AI integration, has slipped to $3.17 trillion after a 15% decline in its stock price this year. Despite its impressive growth, Nvidia faces some challenges. Rising trade tensions between the U.S. and China could affect its ability to export its most powerful chips. Analysts also caution that as AI adoption becomes more widespread, demand might shift to more affordable alternatives, posing a competitive threat to Nvidia’s high-margin products. Even with its meteoric rise, Nvidia’s stock is currently trading at around 33 times expected earnings. This is actually lower than its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio of 41, according to LSEG. While lofty, the valuation is not considered excessively stretched relative to its historical norm, indicating investor confidence in sustained future growth.
