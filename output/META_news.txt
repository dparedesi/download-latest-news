European shares ended Friday at a record high, powered by a surge in miner Glencore. On the trade front, European Union member states confirmed a majority support a free-trade agreement with South American bloc Mercosur. Global market sentiment also received a lift as investors reacted to US labour market data. The Irish index of shares ended the week marginally higher, with gains in food and construction stocks buoying the market. But banking shares remained mixed, with AIB notching up a gain on Friday of just under 1 per cent, while Bank of Ireland fell back slightly as the week drew to a close. Among construction stocks, insulation specialist Kingspan added 2.8 per cent, while home builders Glenveagh and Cairn gained 0.9 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares shed 1.5 per cent, while ferry group ICG fell by 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip FTSE 100 recorded ⁠its second straight weekly gain and its highest ever close of ⁠10,126.6 points, marking a 0.8 per cent gain on ⁠the day. Shares in miner Glencore jumped ⁠9.6 per cent to their highest since July 2024 following news it is ‌in ​talks ‍with Rio Tinto about a takeover that would create the world’s largest mining group, valued at almost $207 billion (€178 billion). London-listed shares of Rio closed 3 per cent lower. Among other stocks, Sainsbury’s fell 5.3 per cent after Britain’s second-largest supermarket group reported a fall in general merchandise ‌and clothing sales for the Christmas quarter. IAG fell 2.7 per cent after the airline group named ⁠the finance chief of its British Airways unit, Jose Antonio Barrionuevo, as the group’s new chief financial officer, due to start in June. The STOXX 600 index climbed 1 per cent on Friday, with technology stocks leading the advance and logging their best week in nearly two years. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML added 6.8 per cent and was the biggest gainer in the tech index after HSBC raised its price target on the stock. Germany’s Infineon rose 2.4 per cent, while STMicroelectronics added 2.9 per cent. Tech shares also got a boost after upbeat fourth-quarter results from TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. Shares in Anglo American rose 2.7 per cent, a day after a filing from the European Commission showed that the miner’s deal with Canada’s Teck Resources is heading for antitrust clearance in Europe. Defence stocks led weekly advances, with a near 10 per cent gain – their best showing since November 2020 – after US president Donald Trump called for higher defence spending. The retail rout carried on from the previous session. Pandora warned of weaker 2025 sales growth, sending shares of the jewellery maker down 13 per cent. US equities rose on Friday to new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index climbing 0.5 per cent at 11.30am in New York, on pace for its second closing high of 2026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rallied 0.8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent. In the consumer sector, Mattel slid 3.27 per cent and Nike more than 1 per cent. Traders were also parsing job numbers. US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, suggesting the labour market continued to soften at year-end, data released earlier in the day showed. The report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting but left the door open for cuts later in the year. On the corporate side, Meta Platforms agreed to a series of electricity deals to power data centres that will make it the biggest buyer of nuclear power among its hyperscaler peers. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are up after the company reported strong December sales. Qualcomm shares were down after Mizuho Securities downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from outperform. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Are Leaders Responsible for Employee Wellbeing?

Time Published: 2026-01-09T15:43:54Z

Work is increasingly understood as a powerful driver of wellbeing, and wellbeing as a factor shaping how organizations perform and endure. We asked Yale SOM leadership expert David Tate how leaders can create environments that support wellbeing without sacrificing rigor, accountability, or results. Has there been a shift in understanding of the relationship between work and wellbeing? Is more expected of leaders now? Yes, there has been a notable shift in how scholars and practitioners view the connection between work and wellbeing. Historically, work was seen primarily as a source of economic security and identity, with wellbeing considered a secondary outcome or the personal responsibility of the worker. Contemporary research, however, emphasizes that work is a significant determinant of psychological, emotional, and physical health and that the organizational environment profoundly influences employee wellbeing. Meta-analyses show that poor work conditions—high workload, low control, and limited social support—are associated with elevated risks of burnout, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders (Kivimäki et al., 2015). Conversely, positive work experiences, meaningful work, and supportive leadership are linked to greater engagement, satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. These insights have reshaped expectations for leaders. Modern leadership is increasingly understood not only as driving results but also as cultivating environments that support employee wellbeing. Leaders are expected to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy and to be aware of how organizational practices affect psychological health (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2013). Organizations are increasingly integrating employee wellbeing and psychological safety into strategic priorities, with leaders and executives explicitly accountable for creating conditions that support learning, engagement, and sustainable high performance (Edmondson, 2019; Gallup, 2023). The emergence of chief wellbeing officers and wellbeing dashboards illustrates that wellbeing is no longer solely an individual responsibility but a leadership and organizational concern (Grabarek & Sawyer, 2025). How can leaders pay attention to the wellbeing of employees and still be rigorous and high-performing? Leaders can support wellbeing while maintaining high performance by embedding wellbeing into the very definition of organizational success. Empirical research shows that workplaces emphasizing employee wellbeing often achieve superior outcomes, including higher engagement, lower turnover, improved innovation, and stronger financial performance (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; De Neve & Ward, 2025). Effective strategies include: Importantly, leaders should maintain high standards of rigor while making it clear that it should not come at the expense of personal health or ethical behavior. Evidence suggests that teams led by emotionally intelligent leaders who balance accountability with care are more resilient and productive over time (Cherniss, 2010; O’Boyle et al., 2011). What role should wellbeing play in performance management and feedback conversations? How do you draw the line between being supportive and being intrusive as a leader? Wellbeing should be an integral component of performance management, framed in ways that support rather than monitor employees. Research indicates that employees perform better when leaders attend to both technical and human aspects of work (Grawitch et al., 2006; Grant, Christianson, & Price, 2007). Best practices include: The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. Respecting personal autonomy and confidentiality is critical. Leaders should maintain curiosity, empathy, and transparency while staying within professional boundaries (Edmondson, 2019; Kulik et al., 2016). Integrating wellbeing into performance management enhances engagement, reduces burnout, and promotes sustainable performance. When framed appropriately, wellbeing is a powerful lever for high performance rather than a distraction from it.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr Is Back!!: Nvidia’s $20B Groq Grab, Meta’s $2.5B Manus Play, and Why “Invisible Unemployment” Will Define 2026

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The latest from the 20VC x SaaStr collaboration with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll Jensen Huang wanted the deal done before Christmas. He got it in two weeks. Nvidia just dropped $20 billion on Groq—a company doing sub-$50 million in revenue—because when you’re protecting a $3.5 trillion market cap, 1% is a rounding error. Meanwhile, Meta paid $2.5 billion for Manus (25x ARR), Yan LeCun is calling Alex Wang “naive and inexperienced,” and somewhere in America, Stanford CS grads are discovering that a degree from the best university in the world doesn’t guarantee a job anymore. Welcome to 2026: the year of spite startups, 24/7 AI inference, and “invisible unemployment” that won’t show up in the government numbers but will reshape everything. Jensen didn’t buy Groq for its $175 million in revenue. He bought it to eliminate margin pressure on a $100 billion annual cash flow machine. “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia,” Rory explained. “This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table.” The math is brutal in its simplicity: $20 billion is less than 1% of Nvidia’s market cap and less than 20% of annual free cash flow. For that price, they neutralize a competitor, acquire Jonathan Ross (inventor of Google’s TPU), and close the whole thing before the holiday party. The kicker? 3x the last round is the traditional “remove all objections and close instantly” price. Jensen knew exactly what he was doing. Benchmark turned a controversial bet into a 5x return in 8 months. But the real story is why the founders sold at $2.5 billion when they were doing 125 million run rate and growing fast. “This was a local maximum deal,” Jason argued. “Best of breed orchestration layer, but Anthropic can do some of this. OpenAI is going to do some of this. They’re all running multiple LLMs. They’re all orchestrating multiple agents.” The founders owned 80% of the company. At $2.5 billion, they each walked away with roughly half a billion dollars. In Singapore. With 0% capital gains tax. “In the end, words are words and half a billion dollars is life-changing,” Rory added. “At some point the entrepreneur can turn to you and say: if you think $2.5 billion is underpriced, don’t cash out my $500 million—give me $50 million off the table.” Anthropic was born from spite with OpenAI. XAI was born from spite. Now Yan LeCun is potentially starting another spite startup after publicly calling out Meta’s AI strategy. “If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite,” Jason declared. “This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” But it goes deeper than founder feuds. Jason argues many CEOs are driven by spite about how they were forced to run companies in 2021—the “kumbaya work at home” era that let the world pass them by. “Zuck is spiteful he was forced to run the company in a certain way. He may burn every last penny he has, but some of it’s out of spite that they got this far behind.” OpenAI is spending 46% of revenue on stock-based compensation—34x higher than comparable pre-IPO tech companies. The panel’s take? It makes total sense. “If you’re a CEO and you have zero shares, you don’t worry about dilution,” Jason noted. “Sam just wants to build the biggest greatest AI company on planet Earth. If he dilutes everyone 99%, it doesn’t impact him at all as a shareholder.” Rory added the historical perspective: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.'” The real tell? Even with $1.5 million average compensation, OpenAI still only has 60% retention among researchers. The talent wars have thrown all conventions out the window. SoftBank closed its $40 billion OpenAI investment on December 29th. Days later, the position was already up 2-3x on paper. “The level of risk tolerance that guy has is just amazing,” Rory said. “He had the right to put $40 billion in OpenAI. Now I better find the money by selling other stuff. He’s scurrying right down to the line to find the money the week before Christmas.” But here’s the real insight: Masa is now the only double-digit percentage shareholder in what could be the most important company of the next decade. Entry price was high, but ownership percentage at this stage is nearly impossible to achieve. “His greatest play ever was Alibaba—getting 20% and holding it for 20 years,” Jason said. “But if OpenAI goes to the moon, this may be his best deal ever. He had to enter later, but he got his double digits. It’s not easy to get double digits at this stage.” OpenAI is developing a pen-like device with a camera and microphone. Johnny Ive is involved. The initial reaction was skepticism—but Jason sees something bigger. “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to.” The insight: When we’re all running AI 24/7—multiple agents, continuous inference, persistent memory across every conversation—we’ll want our AI companion with us everywhere. Not as a note-taking device, but as a permanently present intelligence that knows everything about our lives. “When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” Navan went public and promptly dropped to 4x ARR. A 27% growth company with positive non-GAAP operating income trading at 4x revenue should be a win—but the circumstances tell a different story. “Maybe Navan only IPO’d because it was their least best bad option,” Jason suggested. “700 million in debt, only 200 million in cash. It had to IPO to pay off its debt.” The lesson: If you’re not Figma or better, it’s going to be rough out there. The IPO window isn’t open—it’s barely cracked. And companies like Stripe, Databricks, and Revolut are proving that staying private might just be the smarter play. “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets,” Rory argued. “They can look the public markets in the eye and say: ‘You guys just aren’t a compelling product.'” This might be the most important insight of the episode. Jason sees a massive labor market shift that won’t show up in government statistics—but will reshape tech and society. “Shopify saying for the third year in a row they can hit insane growth without adding any headcount. Every single CEO wanting to keep headcount flat and backfill with AI. This is not robots firing us. This is tighter and tighter companies, radically higher ARR per employee.” The most vulnerable? Entry-level knowledge workers and senior executives who can’t reskill. “If you’re top of your class in math at any school, you will be found by Anthropic and OpenAI. They will find you. But for the other 99% of your class—why do I need you with Claude Code? Why do I need any SDRs? We don’t need any of them.” IBM reported turnover of almost 2% last year. “No one left IBM because they know they got no other job.” Revolut is doing $3.5 billion in profit. Stripe kicks off billions in free cash flow. Databricks just raised at $62 billion. Why would any of them go public? “If you can take out $400 million a year yourself just as a dividend, that’s enough for many of us,” Jason pointed out. “He can play the bank dividend card. At when you’re producing $3.5 billion, what does he own? 18%. Just say I’m going to dividend it out.” The panel identified two distinct categories now: traditional late-stage (companies that can’t yet go public) and what Jason calls “Post-IPO Scale Still Private”—companies that could go public but actively choose not to. “If I was running NASDAQ or NYSE: Why is our product so uncompelling to Ali at Databricks that he got all the way to $150 billion in enterprise value before he thought going public was a good idea?” The scariest insight: Young, driven founders know exactly who the other driven people are in their cohort. And with AI reducing headcount requirements, they never have to lower the bar. “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent,” Rory observed. “The 25-year-old founder knows the five people in his class who were smart and the 95 who didn’t grind—and he’s only going to hire the ones who were smart.” Previously, companies needed 300 people to reach $100 million in revenue. If you can get there with 30, you never have to compromise on culture, work ethic, or talent quality. “If you don’t need 300 people to get to $100 million in revenue anymore, you just don’t need 300 people. So you don’t have to give. So that means no jobs for those people.” On the spite economy: “For venture, this is the era of the spite startup. Anthropic’s a spite startup, XAI and Twitter’s a spite startup. Now we’ve got Meta’s AI guy who’s doing a new spite startup. If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite. This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” On invisible unemployment: “I call it invisible unemployment and it’s all around us. It doesn’t show up in the government numbers yet, but it’s everywhere. This is the year where we will see the end of so many entry-level sales jobs. We still need AEs. We still need people knocking on doors. We do not need 21 and 22-year-old kids sending emails. Those jobs will disappear.” On AI naming itself: “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to. When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” On Nvidia’s defensive acquisition: “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia. This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table. $20 billion is less than 1% of their market cap and less than 20% of their annual free cash flow. For that, we can buy up a competitor and eliminate that potential margin pressure.” On OpenAI compensation: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.’ Sometimes the budget doesn’t matter. No one remembers the budget for World War II. Winning is the only thing.” On founder vs. VC alignment: “Trying to persuade a founder to hold on when they don’t want to is a very hard thing to do. And arguably you shouldn’t even try. In the end, 90% of the time the founder controls the exit decision and the 10% of the time they don’t, it’s usually a mistake for the VCs to try and control it.” On public market dysfunction: “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets.” On the Manus deal math: “If we’re on the Manus board, it’s doing 100 million now. Say it does 3x given the growth rates—that’s only 8x end of year revenues next year. It does feel quite cheap.” On young founders judging talent: “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent. The founder at 25—they’re marked to market on their team and on other people they know. That’s the generation they grew up with. They’re finding these new companies now and they’re going to hire the best and they’re going to discard the rest.” The 20VC x SaaStr collaboration continues.

More from the series → This week’s Media Briefing looks at the main business areas publishing executives have their sights set on as they head into 2026, recalibrating around AI advertising revenue opportunities, brand marketing, and video and creator opportunties, after a humbling 2025. Media execs have big goals for 2026. They’re setting their sights on AI revenue and visibility opportunities, brand marketing pushes, plus a big year in U.S. politics and sports. They may have emerged bruised by a rocky 2025, which hit them with a new search landscape, AI copyright battles and a challenging advertising market. But as the year turns, there’s a sense of renewed resolve. At least that’s the tone for now, according to recent Digiday conversations and seven media execs from CNN, Forbes, Future, Hearst, USA Today Co., The Wall Street Journal, and Vox Media, Digiday spoke with for this story. AI advertising revenue opportunities Publishers are increasingly turning to AI as a practical tool inside their ad businesses. Expect to see publishers integrate AI more deeply into their media buying, yield management and ad sales functions this year, using it to price inventory, package audiences more effectively and extract more value from fewer visits. “In 2026, we’re moving past the ‘experimental’ phase of AI. At Dow Jones, our advertising focus is on using these tools to make our partnerships more precise,” said Josh Stinchomb, global CRO at The Wall Street Journal. The business publisher is integrating generative AI into everything from the initial client research phase to the way it builds and refines brands’ media plans in real-time, helping its ads business move faster with deeper insights that can improve performance, he noted. Other publishers are experimenting with building in-house, media buying AI agents to help automate the process of analyzing, planning and curating RFPs — another area that will evolve this year. This is all buoyed by the fact that publishing execs are seeing the first quarter of 2026 off to a good start, with ad revenue pacing better this month compared to previous years for some, thanks to premium video, and direct and PMP deals. AI visibility gains and KPI changes Publishers’ KPIs are shifting as traffic and scale fade as the key metric for a successful media business. Top publishing execs are orienting their businesses entirely around KPIs, like conversion and engagement metrics, including subscriptions, registrations, and overhauling sites to make them stickier so that even if they get fewer visits, they’re more valuable. What this ultimately means for goals and targets facing SEO and audience teams this year remains unclear, but it’s likely to become apparent soon. Resources are also now being funneled into tracking newer metrics like AI visibility, or how often a publisher is mentioned or cited in an AI search tool. Media execs are working with third-party tools — or building their own analytics — to get a better understanding of how, when and why they’re being mentioned across AI products. U.K.-based publisher Future recently built its own AI visibility measurement tool to do just that. The insights from that tool, called Future Optic, is key to the company’s editorial and branded content strategy this year, according to Future CRO Michael Peralta. “We’re only on first base on some of the stuff that we’re doing around AI and working with LLMs, so that’s a big deal for us for [this] year,” he said. Brand marketing push AI visibility measurement tools aren’t the only thing publishers are putting more resources behind. With search and social algorithms deprioritizing news, publishers are revisiting brand marketing, as they can no longer rely on organic traffic or discovery from platforms. “One of my big goals [for 2026] is for [people] to really know us as Future… We have [all of these different brands], and we also have scale,” Peralta said. The Financial Times debuted a marketing campaign for its subscription product on Wednesday, across TV, out of home, audio, digital and social. Publishers like Hearst, NBC News and Reuters ratcheted up their brand marketing last year, debuting expansive campaigns across platforms. The Economist also told Digiday it had big plans to bolster its brand marketing, in part by promoting access to more content for free to increase registration and subscription conversions. More media companies will funnel money into these campaigns to draw attention to their companies and the content they produce. “In a world of content commoditization, our biggest priority is to succinctly communicate how our brands, shows and podcasts add unique value to consumers and customers,” said Geoff Schiller, Vox Media CRO. Video expansions and creator collaborations News outlets like Time, CNN, The New York Times added more vertical video to their sites and apps at the end of last year, to appeal to audiences and marketers accustomed to consuming content and buying ads in this format on social media feeds. For Time and Recurrent Ventures, video ad revenue will be one of the biggest growth drivers of their businesses in 2026. Likewise, Guy Griggs, svp of ad sales and client partnerships at CNN, said his top priority for 2026 is to expand and monetize more brand-safe online video and streaming content. At the same time, publishers are building their own networks of creators they can invest in to collaborate on personality-led video, to drive more video ad revenue and audience engagement. Publishers like Yahoo and Future are focused on expanding their creator networks this year. “I think we’ve got a really good right to win in the retail media space, particularly with our high-intent audience. We can work with influencers and advertisers at scale [with our branded content business]. I think that’s going to be a big deal for us,” Future’s Peralta said. Hearst Magazines will expand more into its creator-driven, tentpole franchises this year, after seeing success from programs like ELLE’s Women in Hollywood, Bazaar’s Icons, according to Lisa Ryan Howard, global CRO of Hearst Magazines. “[We will expand] social-first video-led storytelling events and scaled creator integrations to help our partners break through with high-impact programs both domestically and globally,” she said. In 2026, Hearst Magazines is also focused on selling what it calls “360 Bundles,” or ad sales packages that include content production, creator collaborations, and distribution across multiple channels, Ryan Howard added. “More than ever, [we are] amping distribution offsite through social and video, live events, original editorial content collaborations, creator partnerships, newsletters [and] vodcasts,” she said. Meanwhile, Forbes is focused on expanding social and video content, creators and talent partnerships and event franchises, according to Leann Bonanno, the publisher’s chief sales and marketing officer. “In 2026, one of Forbes’ key business priorities is advancing a content strategy built for how audiences and advertising partners engage today — across digital, social, video, AI-driven discovery, and live experiences,” she said. Big election, sports year Like all the election years before it, the U.S. midterms this November represent a potential windfall of audience and ad revenue growth opportunities for news and politics publishers. USA Today Co. (formerly Gannett) is one of the news media orgs banking on this in 2026. In an election year, committing to a “facts-forward approach” for both center-right and center-left voters — is its focus, according to Kristin Roberts, USA Today Media president. This summer, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, providing another opportunity for USA Today Co. to increase its sports coverage this year from both its local and national brands, Roberts added. “Honestly, I think the days of just expecting a fully curated experience of what editors think you should see that day in kind of stacked headline format [on a homepage] — I think those days are over. It just is going to feel archaic to people. So I do think that they expect us to go the extra mile to learn more about them and give them results that are tailored to things they’re interested in.” — Nina Gould, chief innovation officer at Forbes 66%: The decline in the price of BuzzFeed’s stock in 2025, down to $0.93 on Dec. 31. 17,163: The number of job cuts at U.S.-based media companies (TV, film, digital publishing and broadcast) in 2025, an 18% increase from 2024. 3.88%: The year-over-year increase in display advertising revenue for members of the Association of Online Publishers (AOP). $50 million: The size of the investment from billionaire David Hoffmann in newspaper chain Lee Enterprises.

Title: Don’t be fooled — everything has changed for the global economy
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2026/01/07/dont-be-fooled-everything-has-changed-for-the-global-economy/

Twenty twenty-five was a year when everything changed – yet, somehow, nothing did. The US raised tariffs to their highest level in almost a century, China retaliated and global policy uncertainty intensified. And still, global growth is projected at 3.2 per cent, exactly what forecasters expected a year earlier when none of this turbulence was on the horizon. It would be a mistake, however, to think the global economy is unaffected by tariff fights and policy chaos. We have seen this movie before. When the Brexit referendum passed, despite the sharp increase in uncertainty, the economic impact was initially minimal. But a decade later, the UK is estimated to have lost between 6 to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) relative to its pre-Brexit trajectory. The lesson is simple: structural damage reveals itself slowly, and always too late to be reversed. So why hasn’t the world felt the sting of tariffs yet? The answer lies partly in actual tariffs being around half of what the US announced thanks to numerous exemptions. Yet at 14 per cent this remains a sharp escalation, the consequences of which had two offsets. First, AI spending and the stock market surge powered by artificial intelligence (AI) optimism have propped up US growth and buoyed economies such as Taiwan and South Korea that export AI-related goods. Second, fiscal policy has been more expansionary, not only in the US, but even more so in Germany and China. These forces masked the drag from American tariffs and Chinese retaliation. They also made 2025 look far more stable than it actually was. [ Six economic flashpoints to watch out for in 2026Opens in new window ] The global economy is more fragile than headline numbers suggest, starting with the fragility in the AI sector. Investors have finally begun to question the gap between sky-high AI valuations and actual AI returns. Companies such as Meta, which have signalled large increases in AI spending without corresponding revenue streams, have been punished. And they are not alone. AI companies will soon have to confront a harsh challenge: prompts cost money, which means subscriptions will need to rise. A price of $20 (€17.12) a month won’t cover the prompt-costs or sustain the infrastructure arms race against new challengers. This is not a statement about AI’s potential, which is in all likelihood transformative. It is a statement about profitability. With competitive pressure both seen and unseen, the risk of a dotcom-style correction is real. Meanwhile, the celebrated “resilience” to tariffs is deeply misleading. Tariffs have been costly, and especially so for Americans. Roughly 95 per cent of tariff costs have been absorbed by US firms, with only some passed on to consumers. That “some” matters: tariffs alone have added 0.7 percentage points to inflation. Without them, inflation could have been 2 per cent this year – exactly the Federal Reserve’s target. Instead, tariffs have made the typical US household $600 poorer. The damage from tariffs will grow more visible in 2026 as the resilience afforded by front-loaded imports fades and companies pass through a higher share of costs to consumers. China also needs to face up to some uncomfortable truths. Continued reliance on export-led growth is untenable, and Beijing’s new five-year plan, which prioritises allocating resources to technology sectors over shoring up social safety nets and boosting consumption, risks deepening structural imbalances. Europe, for its part, has played the adult in the room by defending a rules-based global system, but it still needs to pursue internal reforms on its own account. The EU must deepen its single market, raise productivity and position itself as an attractive destination for global capital seeking diversification. And the US is not helping. Unfriending the European Union – its largest economic partner – is poor economic strategy. While nothing catastrophic happens overnight, Europeans are trying quietly and gradually to decouple from US financial infrastructure, as they question their reliance on Visa and Mastercard. Just a year ago this would have been unthinkable. The reality is that 2025 was a year when everything changed. The question now is whether 2026 will be the year we correct course. There is an opportunity: the US holds the G20 presidency and France the G7 presidency. Together they can spur action to restore stability to an uncertain and increasingly fragmented global system. If we fail to act, living standards everywhere will decline and the inward-looking policies that command popular support today will become unpopular. But by then it may be too late. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 Gita Gopinath is the Gregory and Ania Coffey professor of economics at Harvard University and formerly first deputy managing director and chief economist of the IMF Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: What CFO pay packages reveal about long-term strategy
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/what-cfo-pay-packages-reveal-about-long-term-strategy/
Time Published: 2026-01-07T13:06:17Z

Good morning. Executive pay packages are increasingly being reengineered around explicit, measurable performance targets, sometimes including stock price gains. Take Christy Schwartz, who became Opendoor’s CFO on Jan. 1 after serving as interim CFO, chief accounting officer, and VP of corporate control. Her initial base salary is $1.2 million through May 15, then drops to $500,000 annually, plus a $100,000 sign-on bonus. But the larger story lies in her long-term incentives. Schwartz received about 1.7 million performance-based stock units, which vest only if Opendoor shares reach $9, $13, $17, $21, $25, $29, or $33 over a 30-day period between April 2026 and October 2030, according to an SEC filing. This ties a substantial portion of her pay directly to the company’s stock performance over several years—a clear reflection of a broader trend toward performance-driven compensation across Opendoor’s leadership. Riot Platforms is taking a similar approach but with a focus on its evolving business model from a pure-play bitcoin miner into a broader power-and-infrastructure company focused on AI and high-performance computing data centers. There was an update in the pay program disclosed alongside the company’s Jan. 2 announcement that it promoted Jason Chung to CFO, effective March 1.Riot recalibrated its 2026 pay program to better align with the company’s strategic priorities, shifting away from bitcoin-centric compensation. SEC filings reveal that once Riot secures a data center tenant, executive incentives will focus on revenue and net operating income tied to those operations. Specifically, “Data Center Revenue” and “Data Center NOI” will each account for 15% of the annual incentive plan, with payouts ranging from zero to 200% depending on results. At the same time, the adjusted EBITDA metric will drop to 25% weighting. Riot didn’t respond to a request for a comment. In connection with his promotion, Chung’s annual base salary rose to $550,000 from $500,000. Meanwhile, CEO Jason Les and Executive Chairman Benjamin Yi will see base salaries increase to $900,000 from $600,000, eliminating the portion previously paid in bitcoin. Their target bonus opportunities under the annual incentive plan also increased to 125% of base salary from 100%, and their employment agreements were extended through Jan. 10, 2031. Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of executive search firm Cowen Partners, told me that Les’s base salary increase “functions as a buffer against variability in incentive compensation, particularly if performance-based payouts are reduced or less certain.”Aligning executive incentives with company performance and long-term shareholder value can be an effective approach, Cole said. However, he cautioned that it can also create unintended consequences in some cases. The same structures can encourage risk avoidance when missing targets carries immediate downside, while potential rewards are delayed or capped, he added. This is particularly relevant in evolving sectors such as AI, where strategic investments are becoming essential for sustainable growth, but accurately gauging how long they will take to generate financial returns is challenging. As Opendoor, Riot, and other companies recalibrate executive pay, the trend toward tying compensation to long-term performance is clear. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Jeffrey Lee was appointed EVP and CFO of ProAmpac, a flexible packaging and material science company, effective Feb. 9. Lee succeeds Eric Bradford, who has served as ProAmpac’s CFO since 2012. Lee joins ProAmpac from Cornerstone Building Brands, where he served as EVP and CFO for more than six years. Before Cornerstone, Lee was SVP and CFO of Wilsonart International, and EVP and Corporate CFO of Contech. Jean-Frédéric Viret was appointed CFO of SpyGlass Pharma, a late-stage biopharmaceutical company. Viret brings over two decades of corporate finance experience. His most recent roles include serving as CFO of NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Blade Therapeutics, Inc. Before Blade, Viret was CFO at Coherus BioSciences, Inc., now Coherus Oncology. Provident Bank has released the results of its annual “Economic Outlook Survey.” While business owners remain mindful of inflation and trade tensions, there are plans for active expansion and investment for 2026, according to the bank. Over 50% of respondents believe the U.S. economy will be in a better position this year, and over 60% expect their own business to be in better shape. Seventy percent of businesses plan to increase capital expenditures in 2026, up from 68% last year. The number of businesses planning a “significant increase” rose from 11% last year to 19% this year. The survey finds that younger leaders are driving the optimism, with 44% of Gen Z owners expecting their business to be in “much better shape” next year, compared to just 14.5% of Boomers. And 58% of businesses are either already using or planning to adopt AI tools this year, an increase from 41% in last year’s survey. The findings are based on a survey of 1,000 business owners and senior executives in the U.S. working for companies with over $1 million in annual revenue. "How JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon notched $770 million in gains for his work in 2025" is a Fortune article by Amanda Gerut. Gerut writes: "Last year was a roller coaster ride, but a market rebound has pushed mega banks’ stock growth nearly 30% and record compensation and bonuses are likely to follow. Leading the charge is JPMorgan Chase CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon, one of the last sitting Wall Street leaders to have navigated the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent passage of the Dodd-Frank reform act, and now the AI boom. Dimon has spent the past 20 years atop JPMorgan and is known for rarely cashing in his stock." You can read the complete article here. "If you’re tech-savvy, you use a password manager that generates strong and secure passwords that are saved in the cloud. But have you heard of or used a passkey?" —Rishi Bhargava, co-founder at Descope, writes in a Fortune opinion piece that most people have probably been using the same password for their online accounts and apps for years. However, passkeys are not yet widely used. “Tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all benefited from instituting passkeys, and industry associations have pushed to make passkeys the standard,” he writes.

Title: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for Apple — one that could shape CEO Tim Cook's legacy

Tim Cook has built a reputation as a steady stalwart of Apple during his nearly 15-year tenure as CEO. His next — and potentially final — chapter at the tech giant could be his most defining yet. This year is shaping up to be a big one for Apple and the 65-year-old CEO, whose eventual retirement is a topic of much speculation in the tech industry. His company is planning a long-delayed update to its virtual assistant, Siri, to solidify its standing in artificial intelligence, and tech analysts expect the next major iPhone innovation to be a highly anticipated foldable model. Cook took over for Apple's late founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Since then, he has led the company through innovative product launches, turbulent times, and financial highs. Under Cook's leadership, Apple has woven together an ecosystem of interconnected products and services that shaped how consumers interact with the company. The iPhone may be its cash cow, but its services business — which Cook expanded to include AppleTV, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music — and smart accessories like the Apple Watch help keep the company relevant. "Tim Cook's greatest accomplishments are the financial evolution of the company, the integration of Apple silicon, and maintaining the iPhone's dominant walled garden ecosystem," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told Business Insider. Still, Cook's greatest challenges may lie ahead as he navigates political changes, greater competition from tech rivals, and an AI arms race that could leave Apple behind. After a turbulent 2025, Cook is navigating the aftershocks of major changes to US policies, Apple's supply chain, and the global smartphone market landscape. The year 2025 was marked by a new high for Apple's stock as the company reached a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time in October. However, it also faced economic headwinds in the form of tariffs and stiff competition abroad. China remains a challenge for Apple, with revenue in the region down 4% in its most recent quarter, though Cook said on the October earnings call that he expects the new iPhone 17 lineup to drive a return to growth in the region. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei are gaining popularity with local smartphone users. A major America-first shift in trade policy under President Donald Trump also prompted Apple to rethink its supply chain. It rapidly shifted some iPhones to India last year and pledged to invest hundreds of billions more in the US in the coming years. Still, China remains a significant manufacturing hub for Apple, and the US-China trade war could continue to impact the company. "So far, Cook has walked that political tightrope with considerable dexterity, but the high degree of economic policy uncertainty and volatility will require him to continue steering the ship with an even hand," Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider. One of Cook's biggest challenges ahead will be cementing Apple's positioning in artificial intelligence, an area where the company appears to have fallen behind its rivals, analysts tell Business Insider. It's not just the launches of Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, that have to be successful. It's also about the way Cook is integrating the technology into Apple's operations. "AI has redefined what legacy means," Martha Heller, CEO of Heller, a specialized technology executive search firm, told Business Insider. Ten years ago, "the goal was to leave a solid foundation so the next leader could create change intentionally without chaos," she said. Now, it's up to leaders to create an AI road map — from the nitty-gritty of products to the mindset of the board — to take a company into the future. Cook has been praised for his steady leadership, but his strategy will have to be turned up a notch if he doesn't want to be caught flat-footed in the age of rapid change. Heller said Cook has made "partial progress" in his performance under the new AI-driven standards that CEOs must consider. "Cook has laid the foundation for Apple's AI future, but the next 12 to 18 months will determine whether reinvention becomes his defining legacy," Heller said. Of course, while competitors are investing billions into their AI ventures, Apple's more modest approach could pay off in the end, as investors closely scrutinize how much Big Tech companies are spending on AI and the return on investment. Apple's AI push has so far failed to fuel the iPhone upgrade super cycle that some analysts, like Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, predicted the iPhone 16 family would bring. The jury is still out on the iPhone 17's overall performance, but Cook said he expected the December quarter would be the "best" yet for iPhone sales. Like other tech companies, Apple also faces the challenge of holding onto its top talent to drive future innovation. In 2025, it lost several AI researchers who left to pursue opportunities at rival tech companies, such as Meta. The company is also coming up against device competition from its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who is teaming up with OpenAI to create an AI gadget. With an AI arms race in full swing and competitors releasing innovative takes on the smartphone, such as foldable models, the pressure is on Apple to act faster than it has recently. "While Cook has kept Apple's growth trajectory moving forward at a steady clip, he has not overseen a step-change innovation that resets Apple's competitive position for the next two decades, as Jobs did with the iPhone," Chatterjee said. The Vision Pro, released in February 2024, failed to gain traction among the masses at a $3,500 price point and lacked a killer app to differentiate it from other headsets. The long-rumored Apple Car, which held potential to be a tenure-defining product for Cook, is widely believed to be scrapped. However, Apple Watch and AirPods have become essential pieces of tech for many Apple users. In 2020, Apple's former CFO Luca Maestri likened the revenue of the wearables segment to that of a Fortune 140 business. But with innovations to the iPhone feeling increasingly incremental over the last decade, 2026 could be the year when Apple's much-needed reset finally arrives, as competitors continue to encroach on its competitive edge at the forefront of innovation. A new and improved Siri is expected to arrive this year, following a few delays. Although Apple hasn't confirmed, supply chain analysts and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have predicted a foldable iPhone could come as early as this fall. If so, it would be in line with Apple's "not first, but best" strategy of not being the first to market a product but to try to do it better than its competitors. Cook hasn't publicly revealed his succession plan, but that hasn't stopped tech industry watchers from speculating on who will replace him and when. The Financial Times recently reported that Cook has intensified his search for a successor. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The year 2025 brought about meaningful leadership changes at Apple. John Giannandrea was the senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy at Apple before announcing his plans to retire in the spring of 2026. Cook's longtime No. 2, Jeff Williams, retired last year. Cook has said in the past that he prefers an internal successor and that he is grooming "several" executives as potential replacements. Bloomberg in October identified John Ternus, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, as "the most likely heir apparent." Whoever ends up stepping in for Cook will be closely examined for their technical background. Unlike Jobs, Cook is famously "not a product guy" — Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson as much. A candidate from a hardware background, like Ternus, could excite Apple's fan base — and investors. Finding his replacement will undoubtedly shape Cook's legacy at Apple. He's spent nearly 15 years building it, seeing the company through several wins and missteps. "Cook's legacy, upon his departure, will be defined by steady and disciplined operational stewardship — proof that a company can be more than just exciting and visionary; it can also be enormously valuable to all its stakeholders," Chatterjee said.

Get businessline apps on Connect with us TO ENJOY ADDITIONAL BENEFITS Connect With Us Get BusinessLine apps on As US operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets | Photo Credit: ANDREW KELLY In a recent campaign-style speech, US President Donald Trump asserted that “the only thing that’s really going up, big, it’s called the stock market, and your 401(k).” He has a point: all major US stock indices realised double-digit percentage gains last year. And yet, the November midterm elections are still a long way off. Were there to be a stock-market correction in the meantime, Trump’s economic point of pride could become a liability. Unfortunately for Trump, a market correction (a 10-20 per cent decline) does seem highly probable this year. There is an unusually high degree of optimism priced into the market, making stocks susceptible to a large pullback in the event of an economic setback — which any number of economic or political “known unknowns” could cause in the run-up to the midterms. Consider the current optimism. It would be an understatement to say that stocks are priced at lofty valuations; in fact, they are priced for economic perfection. As measured by the Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio, the S&P 500 is valued at more than twice its long-term average, and at close to its pre-2001 dot-com high. And as measured by the Buffett Indicator — the ratio of the total US stock-market valuation to US GDP — the market is trading at an all-time record, some 50 per cent above its 2008 high. Another measure of optimism is the current bullishness on the part of fund managers. According to Bank of America, these influential voices are more exuberant now than at any point in the past three years, and their current cash holdings have plummeted to their lowest level on record. Again, such sentiment — and the bets that follow from it — would seem to set the market up for a major pullback should the economy falter in the coming months. Why might that happen? One need only consider the country’s unsustainable public finances, coupled with the threat Trump poses to the US Federal Reserve’s independence, to envisage a return of the bond market vigilantes and a spike in long-term interest rates. Heightening this risk is the country’s high dependence on foreigners to finance its $2 trillion annual budget deficit. If foreigners come to think that the US government will try to inflate away its debt, they will demand higher interest payments on their US Treasury bond holdings, which would increase the cost of mortgages, auto loans, and many other common forms of borrowing. Another domestic risk is the AI bubble, which could burst or deflate at any time. This risk is especially acute considering that as much as half of US GDP growth is being driven by AI-related investment. Moreover, the end of the AI bubble would have a chilling effect on the stock prices of the so-called Magnificent Seven (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla), whose combined valuation is around 35 per cent of the S&P 500’s total. Oracle, whose stock price already fell 30 per cent last quarter, could prove to be the canary in the coal mine. The US stock market could also be shaken by economic reversals abroad. One such shock could come from China, which is still relying excessively on an investment- and export-centric model to drive its economy. With China’s trade surplus now exceeding $1 trillion, increased US and European protectionism has become more likely, and with it, a further breakdown in the international trading system. Another shock could come from Japan, where Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi’s pursuit of an irresponsible budget policy has raised fears of a “Liz Truss moment” that could send Japanese government bond yields sharply higher (as happened in the UK in the fall of 2022). Were that to occur, we could see a disruptive unwinding of the Japanese carry trade (borrowing at a lower interest rate in one country to invest in assets elsewhere) and the repatriation of Japanese capital that has been supporting US financial markets. Finally, as last weekend’s US military operation against Venezuela demonstrated, unexpected or under-appreciated geopolitical events can disrupt financial markets. Even before Trump announced that the US plans to “run” Venezuela until a “proper” transition can take place, China was conducting live military drills in the Taiwan Strait, and Russia was dragging its feet on a peace settlement with Ukraine. China might try to capitalise on this moment to regain control over Taiwan, and Russia may be emboldened to make even more ambitious demands for territorial concessions from Ukraine. Even the smallest possibility of a conflict over Taiwan should be deeply concerning, considering that it supplies more than half the world’s semiconductors. If those who live by the sword die by the sword, the same may be true of equity prices in the run-up to this year’s midterm elections. By emphasising how well the stock market is doing now, Trump could be setting himself up for disappointment if any number of risks materialise.

January 06, 2026 07:00 ET | Source: BitMEX BitMEX VICTORIA, Seychelles, Jan. 06, 2026 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BitMEX, one of the safest exchanges, today announced the launch of Equity Perps, a new derivatives product that allows traders to gain exposure to major U.S. stocks and equity indices using cryptocurrency as collateral. The launch expands BitMEX’s product suite beyond crypto-native markets, enabling 24/7 trading on traditional equity benchmarks, including when U.S. stock markets are closed. Equity Perps are cash-settled perpetual swap contracts that track the price of individual U.S. stocks or indices and do not have an expiry date. Similar to BitMEX’s existing crypto perpetuals, the contracts use a funding rate mechanism to anchor prices to the underlying reference index. Traders can take long or short positions with up to 20x leverage, using assets such as Bitcoin or Tether as margin collateral. “Equity Perps give traders a more flexible way to access U.S. equity markets using crypto,” said Stephan Lutz, CEO of BitMEX. “By removing traditional market hours and allowing crypto collateral, we are extending our derivatives expertise to a broader set of global markets while maintaining the reliability and performance BitMEX is known for.” At launch, Equity Perps are available on a selection of widely traded U.S. stocks and indices, including Amazon, Apple, Circle, Coinbase, Meta, Nvidia, Robinhood, Tesla, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq. BitMEX plans to expand the range of available contracts over time. Trading is open 24/7, with index pricing during U.S. market hours based primarily on real-time equity prices and, outside those hours, supported by tokenized spot prices from multiple exchanges. All Equity Perps trades on BitMEX feature a maker rebate of 2.5 basis points and a taker fee of 7.5 basis points. Funding is exchanged every eight hours, consistent with BitMEX’s existing perpetual swap products, regardless of U.S. equity market hours. In the event of corporate actions such as stock splits, affected contracts will be settled early and relisted once the action is complete. To mark the launch, BitMEX is offering a 70,000 USDT prize pool for eligible users who trade Equity Perps, alongside maker rebates on all Equity Perps contracts. Additional educational resources and product guides are available through the BitMEX website and blog. About BitMEX BitMEX is the OG crypto derivatives exchange, providing professional crypto traders with a platform that caters to their needs with low latency, deep crypto native and especially BTC liquidity and unmatched reliability. Since its founding, no cryptocurrency has been lost through intrusion or hacking, allowing BitMEX users to trade with confidence that their funds are secure and that they have access to the products and tools required to be profitable. BitMEX was also among the first exchanges to publish on chain Proof of Reserves and Proof of Liabilities data. The exchange continues to publish this data twice a week, providing assurance that customer funds are safely stored and segregated.

Title: Is the AI Boom a Bubble Waiting to Pop? Here’s What History Says

As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst. The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history. The S&P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Broadcom Inc. and Microsoft Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Read more: Bank of England Sees Rising Financial Risks From AI and Lending Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the circular nature of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants. Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different. “At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?” Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. Read more: No Firm Is Immune if AI Bubble Bursts, Google CEO Tells BBC “A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.” Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles. Pace, Length One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett. By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index gaining 130%. While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said. Concentration The S&P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who said in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks. Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said. Fundamentals Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins. “It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said. But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago. The potential for credit risk in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After Oracle Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by Societe Generale. Valuations The S&P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years. Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, Cisco Systems Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today. Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said. Investor Scrutiny Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid warnings from investor Michael Burry and the Bank of England. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade. This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises. “I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.” Top photograph: A Samsung Electronics Co. sign with a slogan reading, “AI for All” at the IFA Consumer Electronics and Home Appliances trade fair in Berlin, Germany, on Thursday, Sept. 5, 2024; photo credit: Liesa Johannssen/Bloomberg Topics InsurTech Data Driven Artificial Intelligence

Marcin Wichary 5 January 2026 / 4,400 words / 350 photos I love technology history because it brings me both advice and encouragement: stories of people solving problems despite constraints much bigger than mine, stories of flawed inventions and flawed inventors, stories of oddities that can inform and inspire. Sometimes the blueprints for the best version of the future already exist in the past, but only if you do some spelunking first, and remixing second. Those who read history will be able to repeat it, but under better circumstances, or more stellar execution. Technology history means visiting tech museums, and I have been doing that for decades now. I wanted to reflect on why I love some of them more than the others, so I made this photo essay: six best tech museums Iâve been to, 16 great onesâ¦ and, at the end, three not-as-positive examples. I wrote it mostly for myself to think about what museums mean for me and what makes for the best museum experiences, but perhaps you will find something in it, too. I liked more museums than presented here, of course. And I have a lot more to visit (please let me know if you have suggestions!). But of the ones I have been to, these are the ones that deserve a spotlight. Taiwan (the site near Songshan Park)Â /Â Visited in 2025 /Â nrm.gov.tw This place blew me away. Itâs a newish museum, but hosted in an old, massive railway workshop building complex, so you know the space itself is going to be part of the story â locomotives, huge industrial cranes that lift them around, various bits and pieces of preserved machinery. I generally love this kind of a vibe (even the smell of it all) and find it, in a way, breathtaking. Part of me would choose to live here in an instant. But, there are more things that make this museum special. The production value is impeccable and it seems to be spent on things that matter. For example, there are absolutely magnificent videos here of men restoring old locomotives, presented on big vertical displays. Theyâre transfixing, almost pornographic. But they still feel made by someone who cares about this stuff and wants to show it well, and not just show it off. The landmark exhibit here is a multimedia piece with a huge transparent screen occasionally moving by an important locomotive, showing its innards. Itâs a lavish, impressive animation, with huge thumping bass and 3D rendersâ¦ maybe a bit too cinematic, but again: it feels like itâs coming from the right place. Trains are amazing and underrated, and they deserve awe. Generally, thereâs a lot of pride around here, and it feels like the right flavor of pride. In many exhibits, one can sense how people care about restoring the old machines and telling their stories, how the railways mattered to Taiwan, how important this preservation of history as a concept is to people here. Flanking the big building with amazing sightlines are some smaller, more traditional exhibits. The focus seems to be a bit more on the cultural aspects of railways, and less on the tech side. I learned so much from it all. Overall, itâs a fantastic blend of old and new, with thoughtful details. Itâs big and inspiring enough I came back again a week later. There are many other disused buildings around the refurbished one that havenât been touched yet, and I understand the aspiration is to turn it into almost a park of sorts. I hope Iâll be back to check out how theyâre doing. Figueres, SpainÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â mte.cat This was perhaps my best museum experience ever â the right thing at the right time in an unexpected place and with unexpected intensity. This thread captured the story, and I reflected upon it later here. So yeah, Iâm biased, but the reasons for that bias are worth celebrating. This museum definitely belongs to the joint category of âgreat collectionâ + âgreat passion,â with so many typewriters you could sometimes even pause and trace the history of individual manufacturer, as all of their models are shown side by side like on a timeline. Thereâs also something I always appreciate: the ephemera. Itâs not just typewriters, but also the desks, the accessories, the advertisements, the complementary devices. There is a risk of a museum doing that kind of stuff in a way that feels like hoarding and I donât fully understand yet what separates one from the other. This museum is not an extreme time capsule like other museums can be, but I find the ephemera crucial to understanding the machines. Nothing, after all, is used in isolation, and no device can be removed from the context of its time and its surroundings. Iâm also very happy I got to briefly meet the creator of the museum (and his whole family) before his passing. MelbourneÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â acmi.net.au My photos wonât do ACMI justice. This is an extremely well-made museum, filled with great experiences and stories. Every exhibit here drips with creativity, from simple ideas like splitting a car in half with two well-placed mirrors, or miniatures of TV rooms held inside actual TVs. There are probably fifty great little details here that will make you happy even if you donât notice them, and are a proof that a museum is so much more than its collection. Even the applications of technology are wonderful and exemplary. This isnât a museum where youâd encounter a piece of paper saying âunder maintenanceâ slapped atop a stock Android tablet. For example, there is one exhibit here where you can edit a video by moving wooden blocks: Upon entry, you get a cool artifact resembling a View-Master reel where you âcollectâ interesting information by tapping on things; most museums would screw this up somehow, and here it works flawlessly and the interactions are delightful. It feels the way we want tech to be â serving and enhancing, integrated, reliable, in the background. You can tell the museum is run by a designer! This is all really creative and endlessly inspiring. Top of my list. My strict travel plans meant I only visited once, and I regret it, asÂ I feel I only scratched the surface. BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â computerspielemuseum.de This museum punches above its weight. Most videogame museums Iâve seen are vehicles for hollow nostalgia, arcades by a different name. But Berlinâs Computer Game Museum has more depth and tries to do the art and history of videogames justice. There is a little arcade here, for sure, even styled appropriately and with a cute list of highscores. There are also a few nicely recreated âteenagerâ rooms matching different decades. But there are also rare prototypes of local games (like the East Germanyâs Poly-Play), and some art pieces like PainStation, ROM CHECK FAIL, and the worldâs worst Pac-Man made even worse by attaching it to a comically oversized Atari joystick (shoes off!). The selection of games continues to be surprising elsewhere: Would you expect to see Stanley Parable here? Or ELIZA? The design of the place is also interesting. Thereâs always something around the corner that catches your attention, sometimes with the rooms and machines complimenting each other visually. This museum made me think. Really nicely done. Zwolle, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â computermuseum.nl In the 2000s, the Computer History Museumâs then-new location had an interim state called The Visible Storage: raw shelves, filled with computers. There were some plaques, but most stories came from volunteer docents (I eventually became one of them) running the show. The Dutch Bonami museum is that, except there are no docents. Oh, and the whole place is massive. I have never seen this many microcomputers under one roof. Not even close. I think there must be thousands of computers here, and itâs funny how just the scale alone elevates the museum. Without that scale, there would be so much room for improvement. Turn on more of these computers so you can play with them (currently, only a scant few are allowed this). Tell better stories. Add production value. But turns out, sometimes scale is enough. Enter Bonami and you feel awash in microcomputers, surrounded by what feels like the entirety of the 1980s and the 1990s. You can compare small differences between models, ponder design details, find obscure machines you didnât know existed. Itâs worth checking it out to see how this amount of computers makes you feel. Helmond, The NetherlandsÂ /Â Visited in 2022 /Â homecomputermuseum.nl Perhaps an apotheosis of a certain kind of a computer museum: all microcomputers, some turned on, catering to nostalgia for the 1980s and 1990s. Thereâs nothing bad about this approach, but many places do that and after a while it all feels kind of sameây. Not here. Many of the machines here are in working condition and ready to play, which is already very nice. And there will be a few surprises: restoring a Dutch graphics computer Aesthedes with an impressive island of a keyboard, a few Dutch machines like the distinctively shaped Holborn and Eindhovenâs CHE-1, or a âtime machineâ 1990 Tulip computer that allows you to browse the internet like it appeared decades ago. The design and decor are slightly better than elsewhere, too, with various thematic displays, and an open, welcoming feel â and generally it feels the museum is cared for in a way many are not. Mountain View, CaliforniaÂ /Â Visited in 2009â2023 /Â computerhistory.org I love this museum. I wrote about this at least once. I made friends here, learned about storytelling here, hung out with a lot of great volunteers, practiced old-computer photography, and deepened my care and understanding of tech history. The building is great, the demo rooms with PDP-1 and IBM 1401 are fantastic (you can play one of the first videogames against the very person who made it!), and events can be extraordinary too: be it Vintage Computer Festival West, or occasional talks. I miss it now that I live further away. The reason this museum didnât make the main list is that the main exhibit is only kind ofâ¦ okay. There is nothing bad about it, but there is nothing great, eitherÂ âÂ no singular thing stands out. The design is just fine, the videos on exhibit screens are a bit garish (one example here), and no particular memorable design decision or anything really stands out to me. The ending of the main exhibit timeline also kind of peters out, with the web feeling like its weakest part. The museum excels in storytelling through hardware, but things take a dive when things move to software. (To be fair, I am not sure I found a great museum that showcases software well!) SeattleÂ /Â Visited in 2010, 2016, 2019 /Â telcomhistory.org RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â houwelingtelecommuseum.nl Grouping two independent museums in Seattle and Rotterdam because they feel strangely similar, hosted in old telephone exchange buildings, with their infrastructure decommissioned but preserved, restored, and used locally for demonstrations. Itâs a fantastic vibe, walking around among tall stacks of technology that occasionally wake up clacking right next to you. Thereâs a certain scale (huge) and feel (electromechanical) of old machinery that cannot be captured by online photos â but you can experience it in person here. Each of the two museums also hosts a more traditional exhibit in an adjacent room: a general story of telephony and related technologies. In both cases, there is more than you would expect. BerlinÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â Site My experience with this museum was colored by the fact that itâs only open once a month. When I visited Berlin, I only thought about searching for a transport museum with two days to spareâ¦ and it just happened to be open on one of these days. Talk about some lucky timing! This museum is basically a time machine, an old subway station building preserved and in many ways left intact. There is little information around; I bet this functions more as a place for docents to shine. But still, so much great texture! A beautiful building, old machinery, porcelain placards with exquisite German typography, the clocks, the lights, the colorsâ¦ That alone elevated it to something wonderful. I could soak in this forever. LondonÂ /Â Visited in 2023 /Â ltmuseum.co.uk I always thought the London Transport Museum in Covent Garden has an absolutely world-class museum store, but the museum itself is much too small. Turns out there they have an answer to that: a huge depot further out from the city center that you can visit on a tour by appointment, filled with vehicles and artifacts. Itâs great, similar in nature to the Computer History Museumâs Visible Storage or Bonami I just mentioned above; this is where the strength of the collection is most of the allure. The only downside here is that you can only move around semi-freely, as everything is a tour (although there are, apparently, also open days), but otherwise this is a great museum chronicling the stories behind possibly the worldâs most fascinating transit system, satisfying both the hardware and the design sides of my brain. MilwaukeeÂ /Â Visited in 2017 This was an amateurish museum, but the word âamateurâ can bite in either direction, and here it felt positive: an old manâs personal collection of microphones, intimately tied to his career, just a few notches away from hoarding, open only by appointment. I loved it. I got a tour by Mr. Paquette himself, and a few demos, one including putting something of unknown provenance right in my mouth. I donât know if this collection passes some sort of theoretical or academic scrutiny, but the passion alone was palpable and enough. Mr. Paquette died since (you can read this interview to get to know him more), and the museum was subsequently dismantled. So it goes. I am happy that I drove by it that one day in 2017. RotterdamÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â rotterdamsradiomuseum.nl A similar thing to Paquetteâs Microphone Museum, hiding on a third floor of a seemingly unrelated Dutch company. The name is misleading â this is more of a monument to the entire hi-fi era, with radios flanked by record players, tape players, CD players, hi-fi systems, and so on. If youâre into this kind of stuff (I am!), this is delightful; a very nice collection of equipment with all its quirks and strange UI conventions, and some old volunteers willing to explain â if you speak Dutch, that is. North of San FranciscoÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â Site In a list that already stretches the definition of museum, this bends it past a breaking point. KPH is an old maritime radio station, frozen in time for decades, and now occasionally resurrected not for tours or demonstrations, but for volunteers toâ¦ use it once again to communicate with the ships hanging out nearby. I remain enchanted with this building a drive away from San Francisco, where time now stands still. It captures an industry obscure to most, with teletype machines and Morse code mills, which adds a level of authenticity. There is a layer of translation that might be missing to some, but that makes it ever so sweeter if you manage to translate it yourself. ParisÂ /Â Visited in 2024 /Â arts-et-metiers.net WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â nmt.waw.pl I used to look down on old tech museums in buildings from a different era. I thought them old and creaky, in desperate need of a whole week of coordinated dusting, themselves needing to be packaged in some sort of a metamuseum â âlook how tech museums used to be made.â Perhaps growing older softened that stance, or maybe it was visiting of many museums that felt more modern, yet completely soulless. Both of these are old, but worth a visit. They feel like institutions subscribing to an early definition of a âmuseumâ âÂ a historical building, a bit of a distance and aloofness, maybe even some holier-than-thou attitude. But that can also be in a way inspiring, and doesnât mean you canât have fun or learn new things. I mentioned âprideâ earlier. Here the right word might perhaps be ârespectâ or âreverence.â A museum can overdo it, of course, but I think these two get the balance right. And, if not, you can just come for the buildings. North of BarcelonaÂ /Â Visited in 2016 and 2022 /Â mnactec.cat A cool museum north of Barcelona that hosts a sliver of computing history you donât see often: European mainframes. Iâm worried that this might mean this part of the museum is not as popular as others â I imagine nostalgia for mainframes is a small sliver of nostalgia for microcomputers â but I appreciate it. There are a lot of microcomputer museums, but not enough of this. Mainframes require a lot of room and this museum has that, being in an old building that used to be a cotton mill that itself is part of the attraction. (Also, there is a lot more in the collection, specifically textile mills and cars.) CracowÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â mit.krakow.pl I keep harping about âbig buildingsâ and âhuge collectionsâ as something becomes clear in my head: the museums often have an advantage of size. Itâs not that you cannot have a tiny museum that works and means something to peopleâ¦ but if you have a huge building or an impressive collection and you use it well âÂ you have something that few can replicate. This city tech museum in KrakÃ³w reminded me of that rule in a very simple way: It has human-size photos that are really impressive. Thatâs it. That alone felt worth a price of admission, seeing Poland as it used to be a century ago, like you canât in any other setting. I might have never moved less at a museum, just standing next to each photo for many minutes on end, noticing all the little details. (It reminded me of Rick and Megan Prelingerâs Lost Landscapes of San Francisco, which approaches this in a very different format by putting people in a movie theatre once a year and have them watch â and react! â to old clips of San Francisco.) Many other design details here made me happy, from typography wrapping around, to dramatic lighting. (Unfortunately, some exhibits here are much more traditional and maybe a bit, to me, boring.) WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â neonmuzeum.org This museum looks good on insta, but it also looks really good in real life. Sometimes itâs as simple as that. For someone who cares about design and a typography, this was really fun and inspiring. But this is not just some sort of a tourist trap or a âmuseum of ice creamâ pop-up experience for social. Iâve already watched a movie about their preservation efforts, and have one of their books as well. I wanted to visit it because I like patronizing places where I feel people care, and in hindsight, I have been underestimating the effort and care here. By the way, this is in the same fascinating building in Warsaw as Narodowe Muzeum Techniki. WarsawÂ /Â Visited in 2025 /Â muzeum.pgnig.pl This museum is hiding in an old gasworks factory, with some impressive decommissioned machinery. An interesting choice here is that the old building â a once-grimy hall with scary pumps and boilers â is connected with a brand new exhibit, painted in immaculate white, and really nicely put together. Unfortunately (and ironically), the museum feels too small, and some of the interactive parts in the ânewâ section fall a bit flat (although I liked how the ticket serves dual duty as a fake employment card you can punch and use elsewhere, and serves as a nice memento). The small size might be disappointing if you trek out here for a visit, and I hope the museum will expand in the future â but then again, I visited it and enjoyed it. Szczecin, PolandÂ /Â Visited in 2018 /Â muzeumtechniki.eu There are many museums like this â another âvisible storageâ with a bunch of vintage cars and trams under a roof, and not more else (at least not in 2018 when I visited it last), but Iâm putting this on the list for two reasons. First, itâs in my home town! Second, all the vehicles are in an absolutely immaculate condition. This felt important to me when putting together photos for my book âÂ I wanted these machines to never feel decrepit, abused, unloved. Itâs the same here. The exhibit is well lit and airy; compared to many other museums where this kind of a setup would be dingy and dusty, this feels almost like a show room, which I appreciated. (I missed some plaques explaining things, but also appreciated the minimalism and undisturbed sightlines. The museum in ÅÃ³dÅº, just below, solved it well by giving you a gorgeous book you could refer to. This could be a fun solution here.) ÅÃ³dÅºÂ /Â Visited in 2025 / cmwl.pl I was pleasantly surprised by this museum in Polandâs rough equivalent of Detroit â once again, blending the old and the new. A live demo of textile machines given by a guy with a certain attitude was fun (opinionated docents almost always are!), but what really impressed me was the book that I was given for free upon entry. Itâs professional, well-written, and made me revisit what I saw and learned in a different way after I left the building. I really liked this idea and I wish more museums did that. MadridÂ /Â Visited in 2022 / museosmetromadrid.es A simple story: I didnât understand much of the tour because of the language barrier, but I could move around freely and take photos of this fascinating building hosting a 100-year-old engine shed once used by Madridâs metro, and it was fascinating. Just the vibes were enough for me. I donât love putting museums on blast because so much of this stuff is contextual, and I might not even be the right customer anyway! So I wanted to talk about a few I didnât like mostly as a way to highlight whatâs important to me and why they didnât work for me â figuring it all out via some negative examples. As I mentioned above, this museum is just okay â but could be so, so great if it cared about density â there are many spaces and corridors here absolutely devoid of anything. You have tons of space and tons of stuff in the collection. Why waste it like this? To me it feels important that a museum âmeets your freakâ âÂ if you want to just scan and have fun and take a selfie and leave after 15 minutes, this should work. But there should always be more. There should always be too much for one visit, a certain sense of overwhelm and exhaustion and the depth of history. This doesnât have to be in the amount of exhibits or space to cover, but it could be a fractal â a few exhibits, but each one with a lot of details if you want to go deeper; a few dedicated tours or demos; videos to watch or books to read and come back. I know this is not always possible, but âthe second dateâ â coming back to a museum where you already know the ground rules and established some understanding of what a place is and what are its âdimensions,â and you can just revel in details and connecting things together â can be one of the best things ever. The thing I mentioned above about âold and creaky and in need to be dustedâ? Thatâs what this museum feels like. They boast being the oldest book-related museum in the world which should feel like heaven, right? But I found this museum mostly kind ofâ¦ lazy, with exhibits that are simple and uninspiring. I can see some people finding it intimate, but to me this is a museum that ran out of energy and care, and exchanged it with pretense. To me, books deserve so much more. Maybe whatâs important for me is good combination of creativity and care on display â in putting things together, in designing the exhibits, in even one crucial restoration, in small but meaningful details. I donât know if this counts as a tech museum, but this was such a miserable experience. One thing I absolutely hate for museums is being boring and this one is an exemplary boring experience: boring exhibits, boring visuals, boring layout. I realized this in the moment, and also later when I noticed I didnât take one single photo, which is rare for me. The museum is in a dingy underground space, and it just feels old in that 1970s brutalist way where you canât even appreciate the vintage. I worry itâs these kind of places that give museums a bad name â you visit one on a school trip, and you develop a sense that all museums are a waste of time. To perhaps oversimplify the three anti-examples above: I love tech museums that are rich in content, rich in effort, and rich in curiosity â but not necessarily just rich. The 20+ I listed above have all of that in spades, and deserve recognition for that. Thatâs it! I hope you enjoyed this little tour. I also thought it was fun to look at all the logos of the âgoodâ museums. Theyâre not all perfect, but itâs fun to see the themes emerging â including at least 5 places using the shape of their building in the logo! Many of these feel like logos for subway systems, which is also fun to realize. Thank you for reading or scanning all the way to the end. I am always curious about your suggestions of places you loved that I should visit â please let me know if you have any! Copyright Â© Marcin Wichary Published on 5 January 2026.
