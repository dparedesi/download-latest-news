Stocks are slightly higher to start the final full trading week of the year as the dollar strengthens and oil and gold pull back. We have one big question heading into the holidays: Was Friday's double dose of good news a market turning point? 2. Bloomberg reported that Apple is looking into smart doorbell and lock devices to bolster its home security offering and better compete against Amazon's Ring and other rivals. Meanwhile, Wedbush reaffirmed its view that Apple Intelligence will bolster demand for new devices. "In our view, Apple could sell north of 240 million iPhone units in FY25 as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold and this will be the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple's history." 3. Bristol-Myers Squibb said that the European Commission has approved Opdivo plus Yervoy — two drugs that can be used in combination for treating certain kinds of cancer — for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 4. Thousands of Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse walked off the job, joining the tens of thousands of employees in other states on strike to protest unfair labor practices. Meanwhile, Starbucks workers expanded their strike to New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and St. Louis. 5. Reuters reported that President-elect Donald Trump indicated over the weekend that he might be open to some solutions to allow TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10 as the social media company tries to halt a federal ban that would start on Jan. 19, one day before Trump re-enters the White House. While a ban would likely prove positive for engagement on other social media platforms offered by Meta and Alphabet, we still like those Club names even if TikTok successfully challenges the ban. 6. The Financial Times reported that Meta Platforms is looking to add displays to its line of smart glasses, possibly as soon as next year. 7. Honda and Nissan officially began merger talks, with the two signing a memorandum of understanding to consider a business integration. A second memorandum of understanding was also signed that offers Nissan's strategic partner Mitsubishi the chance to join the new company. 8. Xerox will acquire Lexmark, a Chinese-owned printer and printing software maker, in a $1.5 billion deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. 9. A U.S. federal court jury sided with Qualcomm in its chips trial against Arm Holdings, Reuters reported. The jury found that Qualcomm did not breach its licensing agreements with Arm. 10. Two Club stocks received price target bumps. Citi raised BlackRock to $1,200 from $1,150, noting that the company remains its favorite pick among traditional asset managers. Loop Capital raised Microsoft's PT to $550 from $500.

Title: The AI smartphones that never materialized in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-23T13:59:50Z

By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. I’ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you’ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least. The theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn’t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you’ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You’ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you’re free, and add it to your calendar. You’ll ask it about something a friend said to you — maybe in an email or a text, you’re not sure which — and it will go find the information for you. Personally, all of the above sounds great to me. I’d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone — and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos. Right now, AI on your phone can help you write and rewrite an email to sound more professional or react to a text with a disco pigeon emoji. There’s AI to translate phone calls, which kind of works and is actually pretty neat. And there’s AI that can turn a nice picture of food into something horrifying. AI on our phones has offered one weird trick after another: sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, but hardly the platform shift we’ve been promised. All of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring “Galaxy AI is here” at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google’s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn’t call them AI smartphones. Supposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos — but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as “I am eating my chair.” (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off. Later in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company’s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There’s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools — from silly to seriously worrying. Some of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don’t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly — and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you. Last but not least, we met the iPhones “built for Apple Intelligence” in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple’s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming. Right now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they’re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There’s more to come, but what’s here now certainly doesn’t add up to an AI smartphone. It’s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that’s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It’s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it’s so goddamn loud! And there really might be a signal in there — especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions — like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising — so they’re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too. The trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it’s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon — before our collective patience starts to run out.

Title: Apple approaches $4 trillion valuation as investors bet on AI momentum

By Shashwat Chauhan and Medha Singh (Reuters) -Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational (LON:0FRJ) Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy. Meta in April said it would raise its spending levels in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement sent shares plunging as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company's costly AI ambitions. Meta's stock price hit a record on Dec. 11, and it's up nearly 70% year to date as of the market's close on Friday. "It's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there," Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts in October. He noted AI's "positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work," highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company's online advertising business that took a lashing from Apple's iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta's more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental Orion augmented reality headset that Zuckerberg believes could represent "the next computing platform." Zuckerberg's comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta's top priority, directly impacting the company's business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company's more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers. While OpenAI's GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta's family of Llama AI models feeds the company's newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg's primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users. "Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year," Zuckerberg said at Connect. The company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been Salesforce's CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year. Meta's all-encompassing approach to AI has led analysts to predict that Meta is positioned for more success in 2025. Analysts at Jefferies chose Meta as one of generative AI's "winners" heading into 2025, writing in a Dec. 15 note that the company's massive user base represents "one of the richest surfaces to introduce Gen AI tools." Truist Securities analysts said in a note last week that the Meta AI digital assistant could challenge Google's search as "an answer engine for all kinds of queries" and that the social media company is likely to outperform in 2025, potentially benefiting from offering businesses more advanced customer service chatbots. "We believe META has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4B users & >200M businesses across its family of apps," the Jefferies analysts wrote. Meta declined to comment for this article, but pointed to previous statistics and executive comments about AI. Meta has been increasingly talking up the number of people who use Meta AI, with Zuckerberg saying in December that the digital assistant "now has nearly 600 million monthly actives." He launched the Meta AI chatbot in 2023 to rival the generative AI chatbots of competitors, most notably OpenAI's ChatGPT. In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger. But because the company doesn't offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it's difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps. When it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said. The Meta AI "standalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic," Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service. Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, told analysts in July that India has become the company's "largest market for Meta AI usage." That usage has coincided with promising signs of retention and engagement on WhatsApp, Li added. Among those users is Sonny Ravan, a music producer in Pune, India. Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation. Sathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he's increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications. "While I'm talking with my family or my friends, if they're saying something to me and I have to search something, I'm not going to go to Google," said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. "I'm just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I'll immediately search through Meta AI." However, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he's on his phone. If he's at his computer, OpenAI's ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot. Not everyone is a fan of Meta AI's bundling into WhatsApp's search functions. Jawhar Sircar, 72, a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp "quite a nuisance." That's because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly "picks up whatever has been typed" and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions. As far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who "are getting hooked to AI" alongside the Indian government's continued investment in regional computing infrastructure. "Professionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms," Sircar wrote in an email. Advertising is still the key to revenue. Meta said in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company's GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month. "We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions," Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features. While people may associate generative AI with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it's more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta's GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant. That includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad's headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users' Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said. Advertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta's GenAI tools for "a little bit more" help, Reed said. "That's where you win with their AI tools," she said. Reed said the many small advertisers she supports aren't associating the new features with AI. They "think that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads," Reed said. Celina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta's GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta's advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing. "It is visually overwhelming from a user experience," Guerrero said. Ahead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta's GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad's entire in-line copy. "I don't want my copy to sound like ChatGPT," Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that's proliferating the web. "I have two options: One, I don't use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it." Most big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta's built-in AI ad tools, he said. Still, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Meta considering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta's generative AI tools just have "to be good enough to squeeze out more investment" from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager. "It's better for their business, even if it's just those small, incremental changes," Rahmey said "It's a business of scale." With Meta's hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its Llama family of open-source AI models. Llama's advancements "represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers," Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement. Shih, who was one of CNBC's 2024 changemakers, rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff. During her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote "The Facebook Era," a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business. Multiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih's vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software. Meta announced in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was reportedly valued at $250 million. The most logical step for Meta would be to create a larger business around WhatsApp, said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta's GenAI, Schackart said. "Longer term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry," Schackart said about Meta's WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.

Title: The Lonely Skepticism of a Bull-Market Skeptic
URL: https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-financial-page/jeremy-grantham-is-still-waiting-for-the-bubble-to-pop
Time Published: 2024-12-23T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
As investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, and lately for a Trump Presidency, has been driving the stock market to record highs this year, Jeremy Grantham has been having flashbacks. At the end of the nineteen-nineties, the veteran value investor—one that looks for undervalued stocks—shied away from soaring Internet and technology stocks, believing that their prices had departed from financial reality, and that the market was heading for a crash. Far from thanking him for sounding the alarm, many clients of G.M.O., a Boston-based investment-management firm that Grantham had co-founded, held it responsible for making them miss out on a vertiginous rise in the Nasdaq, which went up by about a hundred and sixty per cent between 1998 and 1999. Some withdrew their money from the company. “We started off in a good position, and in two years we lost almost half of our business,” Grantham recalled. “The clients treated us as if we’d done it deliberately. It was a near-catastrophe.” Fortunately for Grantham, his skepticism eventually proved well founded. In March, 2000, the dot-com bubble finally burst, and during the subsequent eighteen months the Nasdaq plunged about seventy per cent, inflicting huge losses on those who had got in near the market top. G.M.O.’s investments, which were positioned for the fall, actually made money during this torrid period, and the firm attracted a lot of new clients. “Suddenly, we were superheroes, and the whole thing turned out fine,” Grantham said. “But that was only possible because I was the boss, and I was putting a lot of pressure on people to double down.” A quarter of a century on, Grantham finds himself in a familiar position as a lonely bear in a market that he regards as a speculative bubble, but which so far has stubbornly defied his predictions of doom. In March of last year, he said that the S. & P. 500 could plunge by fifty per cent: since then, the index has risen by about that much. For this year, despite a tumble last week after the Federal Reserve indicated it will be cautious in cutting interest rates in 2025, the S. & P. 500 is up around twenty-four per cent, and the tech-laden Nasdaq is up nearly thirty-two per cent. Stock in Nvidia, which makes chips that are widely used in large-language A.I. models, has risen roughly a hundred and seventy per cent, and since October, 2022, the month before ChatGPT was released, it’s up tenfold. The firm now has a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. Grantham is unchastened. These days, he has retired from day-to-day portfolio management. At G.M.O., he holds the title “long-term investment strategist,” and he is at pains to point out that he doesn’t speak for the firm. But when he called me the other morning from Mexico, where he had just arrived on a vacation, he expressed deep skepticism about an environment that has prompted many of his fellow-bears to recant. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Nouriel Roubini, an economist whose warnings before the financial crisis of 2008 earned him the nickname “Dr. Doom,” declared, “I would say I am not Dr. Doom: I am Dr. Realist.” Roubini, pointing to the impact of A.I. and other technological innovations, went on: “There are plenty of upsides in economic growth.” Another seasoned skeptic, David Rosenberg, of Rosenberg Research, posted an article on LinkedIn, “Lament of a Bear,” in which he wrote, “I have gained a greater appreciation that it is going to take a whole lot to upset this apple cart.” If there was a modest market correction in the near future, Rosenberg added, his inclination would be to “buy that dip.” Grantham said that he wasn’t surprised in the least to see some erstwhile bears now making optimistic noises. “The longer the bubble lasts, the more people have to throw in the towel for self-preservation reasons,” he said. “In general, in finance, opposing a bubble is not a survival strategy.” During the dot-com boom, many bearish voices on Wall Street fell silent, and some left their jobs, as their firms sought to profit from the boom by promoting or investing in Internet and tech stocks. In such situations, Grantham said, the competitive pressures and financial incentives to join the crowd can be overpowering. He also cited the real-estate bubble in the years leading up to 2007, when many big banks plunged into the business of cobbling together subprime-mortgage securities, only to get stuck with some of them on their balance sheets when the bubble burst and the securities became practically worthless. Initially, some of the banks had shied away from subprime, which involves lending to high-risk borrowers, but when they saw their competitors generating hefty profits, they felt obliged to join in. In a famous July, 2007, interview with the Financial Times, Chuck Prince, the chief executive of Citigroup, one of the firms that was subsequently bailed out by taxpayers, said, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” After reminding me of this quote, Grantham commended Prince, kind of. “He got his timing wrong, but at least he was being honest,” Grantham said. That’s not to say, of course, that at least some of the analysts and investors who are still recommending (or buying) stock in such tech giants as Nvidia, Microsoft (up nearly a hundred per cent since October, 2022), Google (up more than a hundred and twenty-five per cent), and Meta (up more than five hundred per cent) don’t genuinely believe that A.I. will enable these firms, and others, to make much larger profits in the years ahead. Nvidia, for one, is already benefitting hugely from the boom. This past month, it reported net profits of $19.3 billion for its latest quarter, on revenues of thirty-five billion. On a year-over-year basis, its revenues and profits were both up by more than ninety per cent. Grantham can’t argue with these figures, obviously, and he doesn’t dispute the assessment that A.I. is a potentially transformative technology. Indeed, he agrees that it is. But he insisted that this doesn’t alter his view that the stock market is in a bubble, a judgment he said was based on his study of history as well as his own experiences. He pointed to elevated market-wide measures of valuation, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, that is the relationship of stock prices relative to corporate earnings. A rise in the P-E ratio indicates that stock prices are growing faster than earnings—a time-tested warning sign for bears like Grantham. Citing the work of his friend Edward Chancellor, a British financial historian, he also noted that the technology-based financial optimism prevalent on Wall Street has been characteristic of many speculative episodes, including the development of canals in England and railroads in the United States. “The more people believe that the technology is utterly transformative, and the more right they are, the more colossal the bubble becomes,” Grantham said. “Because the technology is so important, and is understood to be so important, it sucks in every last single dollar. And of course, A.I., in that sense, is the real McCoy.” Since November 6th, Trump’s election has only added to the euphoria on Wall Street, where many investors think that tax cuts and deregulation will prove to be another plus for the stock market. Grantham said that he hasn’t yet fully digested Trump’s election, but he regards it as a secondary factor in the market next to the A.I. frenzy, which he dated to the launch of ChatGPT, in November, 2022. During the preceding months, stocks had been falling, following the post-pandemic meme-stock phenomenon in 2021, but they were still highly valued relative to past experience. Grantham said that there is no historical precedent for a new bubble starting when stock prices were already so elevated. That sounded like yet another risk factor. But Grantham, despite his reputation as an überbear, isn’t predicting an immediate crash. Before he hung up and went to get his breakfast, I asked him about the takeaway from his analysis. “My attitude is ‘Watch your ass,’ ” he replied. “But can it go on for another year, to ruin any value investor who tries to oppose it? Absolutely it can.” ♦

Title: Compulsion No, Opportunity Yes in the Delaware Law of Externalities
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/12/23/compulsion-no-opportunity-yes-in-the-delaware-law-of-externalities/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T05:05:55Z
Full Content:
One distinctive feature of the U.S. economy over recent decades has been the rise of the entrepreneur-dominated public company. This development has derived largely from the growth of private funding available through venture capital, so that initial public offerings have commonly served as a “harvesting” moment for the venture capital investors rather than a fund-raising vehicle that would dilute the entrepreneur’s control position. Moreover, the success of the Google IPO in 2004 provided market validation for the entrepreneur’s use of dual class common stock as a way of retaining control while retaining considerably less than 50 percent of the cash flow rights of the public company. The entrepreneur’s “idiosyncratic vision” has also received its celebration in the academic world.[1] We commonly think of corporate law and governance as focused on managerial agency costs, given management’s self-interest and the monitoring challenges faced by diffuse public shareholders. These concerns feature most prominently in the fiduciary duty doctrines that address defensive measures against an unsolicited takeover offer or a control contest through the proxy system. Controlling entrepreneurs present a quite different set of challenges for corporate law and governance. Controllers may limit managerial agency costs, but their self-interest produces so-called controlling shareholder agency costs.[2] Alongside the rise of a new class of controllers has been a fundamental change in capital markets: the rise of portfolio investing, whether through asset managers or self-help portfolio construction, that captures the insight that investors can achieve higher risk-adjusted returns through a strategy of diversification that smooths out firm-specific risk.[3] A specialized financial intermediary, the asset manager, has exploded in significance.[4] These capital market developments came to the Delaware courts this year in a way that produced a series of unusually important cases: In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig.[5] arguably expanded the range of controller-driven transactions that require heightened procedural measures to achieve business judgment rule protection; Tornetta v. Musk[6] looked beyond a bright-line test of equity ownership percentage in deciding whether a CEO had “control;” and W. Palm Beach Fire Fighter’ Pension Fund v. Moelis & Co.[7] held that control-shifting shareholder agreements were inconsistent with board-centric provisions of Delaware law. Moelis was subsequently overruled by legislative amendment.[8] Finally there was McRitchie v. Zuckerberg,[9] holding that a company’s board and officers are not obligated as a matter of fiduciary duty to pursue a strategy that would accommodate the purported interests of the company’s shareholder majority of fully diversified investors (“portfolio investors”) in reducing externalities but rather should pursue a “single firm” or “firm-specific” strategy. This outcome is hardly a surprise, but the broad phrasing of the opinion casts some unwonted shade on the also axiomatic obverse proposition – that a board may, shielded by the business judgment rule, take account of the interests and desires of the dominant portfolio investors in pursuing a business strategy. It is directors’ discretion shielded by the business judgment rule but subject to the legitimating acquiescence of shareholders that is Delaware’s gift to the current debate over corporate behavior. As a bonus, although rejecting compulsion by judicial fiat, the court sketches explicit private-ordering routes under Delaware law to compel management of the firm, as a fiduciary duty matter, in light of the interests of fully diversified investors. The opinion includes a cautionary reflection on the limits of corporate law, at least the law of a single small state, as a lever for the pursuit of pro-social objectives. This is the recent case that I think offers the deepest dive into the possibilities and limits of Delaware corporate law. Compliments must be paid to the cleverness of the McRitchie complaint in two respects. First, it argues that the traditional framing of the directors’ duties in terms of “the corporation and its shareholders” means that at least in cases where the shareholder majority is fully diversified portfolio investors, the directors and officers need to manage by taking account of those shareholders’ portfolio interests. Second, because the directors and officers and controlling shareholder have concentrated investments in the specific firm – here Meta—their interests conflict with the interests of the portfolio investors, and thus they bear the burden of showing “entire fairness” in their chosen strategy. The court rejects plaintiff’s first move as a kind of a pun. “The corporation and its shareholders” necessarily refer to shareholders in the single firm model, and no one would think otherwise, much as a fish has no concept of an environment other than “water.”[10] The court handles plaintiff’s second move with a jujitsu sidestep, arguing that the equity interests held by Zuckerberg, the officers and the directors actually align their interests with their fiduciary duties as seen from the firm-specific perspective. But of course there is a conflict, as there is with virtually every situation of a controller, who directly or indirectly will extract some private benefits of control. A permissible level of private benefit extraction is explicitly and implicitly allowed in the cases. Explicit private benefit extraction is at the core of the seminal case of Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien,[11] in which the Sinclair parent used its control over its partially owned Venezuelan subsidiary Sinven to produce a dividend payout of virtually all Sinven’s profits, which had the effect of denying Sinven the freedom to pursue energy opportunities outside of Venezuela. Because the dividends were paid out pro rata – one share, one dollar – the Delaware Supreme Court held that the dividend payout decision was not “self-dealing” and was subject to permissive business judgment review. By contrast, the cancelling of a contractual obligation owed by Sinclair to Sinven – which would have resulted in disparate pecuniary treatment – was self-dealing and thus triggered “entire fairness” review. It is of course plain that in resolving the conflict of interest between the controller and the public minority shareholders, the court rejected the “firm specific” test. The dividend payout did not maximize Sinven’s value as a public company. Nor as a normative matter should this necessarily trouble us. As Gilson and Gordon (2003) argue, this deviation in favor of the controller reflects an allowable level of private benefits that would compensate the (undiversified) controller for extra risk-bearing while providing a benefit to the public (diversified) shareholders in the control of managerial agency costs.[12] Implicit private benefit extraction is at the core of Mendel v. Carroll.[13] The controlling Carroll family made a take-private proposal for Katy Industries at a price negotiated with the special committee of $25.75 per share, thus presumably triggering the board’s Revlon duty to obtain the highest value for shareholders. Overbidders arrived. The Pensler-Steinhardt group offered $27.80 per share for all shares and asked for an option exercisable at the deal price that would enable it to prevail over the expected opposition of the Carroll family. The Carroll family withdrew its proposal, and the court refused to order the board to grant the dilutive option. Chancellor Allen decided against granting the injunction on the ground that the Carroll family simply valued its control block at more than $25.75 a share. Perhaps the family had private information about the value of the firm, but this presumably would have been elicited in the special committee’s scrutiny of the initial take-private offer. Instead, the family valued the pecuniary and non-pecuniary private benefits of control by more than the offered price.[14] In short, we are far from assuming there is no conflict between controllers and public shareholders just because the controller owns shares. Moreover, validating the controller’s utility function would not necessarily produce the highest value from a firm-specific perspective. [15] Maybe we can put aside the controller cases on the ground that the conflicting shareholder interests in these cases are still about allocation of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements flowing from the specific firm and not about increasing the value of other investments of the controller. But this doesn’t do justice to the objection. Sinclair wanted the dividends from Sinven precisely because it wanted to make investments elsewhere in its portfolio of opportunities. Controllers commonly control dividend payouts (or stock repurchases) with the rest of their portfolio in mind. Thus the controller cases show us that the court is incorrect about the incentive alignment of the controller’s stock ownership and also about the demands of a single-firm approach. But those cases show that the plaintiff is wrong too. The corporate world is filled with cases in which controllers bring a multi-dimensional objective function to the operation of the firm, but those decisions are routinely thought of as presenting business-judgment-rule questions only, assuming no blatant skewing of pecuniary payouts.[16] The court cites many cases of different scenarios that employ specific-firm rhetoric, more obviously prioritizing the interests of shareholders over stakeholders (as in Revlon) but implicitly seeming to rule out consideration of the shareholders’ other investments. As a doctrinal matter, this may be mechanically accurate but functionally wrong. Let’s take the easiest case, the forms of corporate governance. Firms typically adopt governance attributes (e.g., single class board; annual say-on-pay; various board committees and leadership structure) because these are regarded as “best practices” by fully diversified shareholders looking to maximize performance across a portfolio of firms without the costly work that would be required for firm-specific tailoring.[17] Boards commonly acquiesce to such shareholder preferences even when they subjectively believe that alternative arrangements would be superior on a single-firm basis. More fundamentally, firms pick their business strategies to accommodate the interests of shareholders who they know are diversified portfolio investors. This is how I have developed the point previously: We have also accepted without question allowing the risk preferences of diversified investors to shape our theory of optimal firm structure in a way that has firm-specific consequences.[18] Diversification at the portfolio level means that such shareholders disfavor diversification at the firm level, biasing the firm against conglomeration and other diversification measures that may reduce the financial distress risk at the own-firm level and may thus increase costs for the undiversified shareholders. Diversified investors encourage risk taking at the firm level to maximize own-firm expected returns, despite the greater own-firm solvency risks, on the view that this strategy will increase expected returns across the portfolio. As part of this approach to risk, diversified investors push for cash distributions despite the increased own-firm risks. Portfolio investors are not mere kibitzers with talking points; their support is a crucial factor in the success of hedge fund activists who commonly push these strategies on target firms.[19] The say-on-pay mechanism is another vehicle by which portfolio investors promote the pursuit of a particular strategy of maximization. These theoretical understandings do not obligate the directors or officers as a matter of fiduciary duty to follow (or avoid) particular business strategies in their management of the firm, but the observed pattern of M&A activity (including divestitures) shows how directors and officers have chosen to accommodate the objectives of portfolio investors. Inevitably there will be a conflict between the interests of diversified and undiversified investors on this dimension. It turns out that a portfolio approach is embedded at the core of ‘shareholder wealth maximization,” as it is commonly understood, in light of how portfolio theory is critically involved in stock price formation.[20]Modern Portfolio Theory holds that investors are compensated for bearing risk, but only for risk that cannot be diversified away.[21] This is operationalized through specific pricing models like the well-known “Capital Asset Pricing Model” (“CAPM”). Thus market prices of specific securities are set on the assumption that investors are holding such shares in a well-diversified portfolio. Firms trying to “maximize shareholder value” will avoid unrelated diversification, the effect of which may be to reduce own-firm risk but at cost of local inefficiencies in managing a conglomerate enterprise, resulting in a stock price penalty. This follows from a price formation process that assumes idiosyncratic risk can be substantially eliminated through portfolio diversification. More generally, when managers are trying to “maximize shareholder value” for a widely held public company they cannot escape the portfolio structure of share ownership and will almost invariably be acting at the behest of portfolio investors. In short, what may serve the interests of portfolio investors will often disserve the interests of the undiversified. In this important respect, there is no such thing as a “single firm focus.”[22] Rather, at most it is what could be described as a “single firm focus constrained by awareness that the majoritarian shareholders are portfolio investors and their interests are best served by a firm strategy that in significant respects takes that fact into account. But perhaps there is less conflict than one might think between maximizing on a firm-specific basis and taking account of the objective function of portfolio investors. If pricing of the firm’s stock is embedded in Modern Portfolio Theory, then running the firm in accord with the preferences of portfolio investors may well produce the highest stock price. But note, while this might produce the best risk-adjusted returns for the portfolio investor, it will not for the undiversified investor, who may have a substantial investment in the specific firm. So this conclusion follows: The doctrinal framing of the board’s role in terms of a single-firm model casts a veil over how board decisions are commonly made, which takes account of the desires and interests of the firm’s dominant, sometimes controlling but sometimes fully diversified, shareholders. The McRitchie court is plainly correct that a board cannot be compelled, as a matter of Delaware fiduciary law, to take account of the interests of diversified investors in the management of the firm, particularly as regards externalities and even patently obvious systemic externalities such as climate change. But the court’s rhetoric goes too far in its insistence on an exclusively firm-specific focus. Surely the firm can seek to avoid externalities, including the systemic externalities that diversified investors will be keenest to avoid. Delaware fiduciary law does not require profit maximization at the cost of what the board determines are externalities that it wants to avoid. More generally the board has freedom under the umbrella of the business judgment rule, certainly if framed as in consideration of the long term as well as the short term, to take into account the pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests of the actual shareholders of the company. So if the board can consider the interests of the shareholders who are controllers, it ought to be able to consider the interests of the shareholders who are diversified portfolio investors. As noted above, this already occurs. The key question is preserving the legitimacy of directors in taking these actions. This is why the integrity of shareholder voting is critical and must be protected. This has been acknowledged in Delaware, most recently in the striking down of anti-activist pills[23] but also more broadly.[24] At the end of McRitchie v. Zuckerberg, Vice Chancellor Laster plays a trump card in turning down plaintiff’s request for an injunction that would impose affirmative duties on a board and management to reduce externalities. Such a mandatory approach is not sustainable, he says. Objecting corporations and shareholders would simply leave. Delaware corporate law does not provide the lever to force corporations to take what at least some shareholders regard as a more pro-social approach. For scholars of corporate law and governance VC Laster’s final paragraphs on the plaintiff’s claim are sobering: By explicitly rejecting the notion that a board of directors can act loyally when consciously deciding to violate positive law in pursuit of greater profits, Delaware ensures that positive laws and regulations have bite. Through those laws and regulations, governments can impose meaningful restrictions on externalities. Through its corporate law, Delaware supports those efforts. It is frankly difficult for Delaware to use corporate law to do more. Reformers who look to Delaware law to address externalities must acknowledge the larger political environment. Delaware is one of fifty states, each of which can offer entities embodying different corporate law packages. Delaware is not California. Among the fifty states, Delaware has one of the smaller human populations (only around one million souls), one of the smallest geographical areas (albeit conveniently located), and a relatively small economy (though mighty in spirit). Delaware does not have the market power to force anyone to use its corporations, its law, or its courts. Delaware must identify niches where it has a comparative advantage—like corporate law—so that entrepreneurs want to use its corporations, legal practitioners want to choose its law, and parties want to litigate in its courts. Delaware has traditionally filled the corporate law niche by taking a distinctively nonpartisan, technocratic approach. Delaware seeks to supply corporate practitioners with a flexible legal framework, broadly enabling in character but subject to some mandatory floors, that gives managers (framed broadly) expansive discretion to take risks and pursue profit, while at the same time protecting the legitimate rights and expectations of investors. Delaware has not used its corporate law to address hot-button social issues or to intervene in societal debates. Depending on an observer’s political leanings, there are any number of salient issues that Delaware might use its corporate law to address. But to the extent the General Assembly sought to intervene on any of them, entrepreneurs who did not like the answer could incorporate their firms elsewhere. Strong externality regulation is just one example. If the General Assembly sought to make Delaware the externality regulatory for the country (or the world), corporations who did not agree could readily opt out. The lesson is a broader one. State-based corporate law in general, and Delaware law in particular, is a poor vehicle for addressing externalities. Delaware law mandates that its entities and the fiduciaries who manage them comply with positive law. That legal requirement promotes legal compliance in its own right, while also providing a mechanism for holding fiduciaries accountable when they knowingly cause an entity to violate positive law. To ask more from state-based corporate law is to pick the wrong tool for the job.[25] So: “’Delaware law does not charter law breakers,”’[26] and officers and directors may incur liability in a derivative suit if they intentionally violate the law, and, it seems, if they egregiously fail in their oversight duty with respect to compliance. In this way Delaware corporate law sails parallel to the democratic process that enacted these laws. In In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig and in Tornetta v. Musk, we learned that Delaware facilitates shareholder democracy by relying on shareholders to determine the decision rule in a contested fiduciary duty case where, but only where, appropriate disclosure and process have been followed. In McRitchie v. Zuckerberg we learned that the court will honor shareholder decisions to redraw corporate purposes and the board’s duties in the corporation’s foundation documents but will not “blue pencil” those measures through law-like imposition. While Delaware corporate law is not a tool to compel what some might regard as pro-social behavior (other than compliance with law),Delaware would permit directors broad discretion in deciding which externalities to address and to what extent and would treat this permission as subject not to judicial review but to shareholder acquiescence. That leaves ample space for shareholders to petition, for directors to act, and for shareholders, through the processes of corporate democracy, to have the last word.

[10] The irony in the vice chancellor’s citation to David Foster Wallace’s Kenyon Commencement Address, https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/, is that Wallace’s point was to urge his audience to question that which seems so obvious. “[T]he real value of an education … has almost nothing to do with knowledge, and everything to do with simple awareness: awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight all around us, all the time, that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over: ‘This is water.

Assume the target has 100 shares outstanding. Controller owns 50, the public owns 50, the stock trades at $10 per share, based on the company’s expected future cash flows. The controller deems its private benefits are worth $1.50 per share. A prospective bidders believe it can improve the company’s operations by 10 percent and so is prepared to bid up to $11 a share for all shares. The controller refuses, even though the company would, on a cash flow basis, be more valuable after the transaction. [16] The complaint is oddly framed in terms of externalities without any obvious connection to a portfolio investor’s pecuniary interests. It maybe that Meta’s engagement algorithms produce socially harmful behaviors and may spread misinformation that affects elections or disrupts teenage sociability. The impact on the economy and thus the other stocks in the investor’s portfolio is far from clear. There is nothing about the fact of portfolio investing that would necessarily incline such an investor to be more concerned about such harms than an undiversified Meta investor; the reverse seems more likely since the undiversified investor may feel more responsibility for Meta’s conduct.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change From the Heart of Liberty Blog. Don Harrision Sign Up To Receive Regular Heart of Liberty Bulletins Here The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the young goat . . . and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. Isaiah 11:6 The book of Isaiah, written between the 8th and 6th centuries BC, prophesies a utopia where all natural enmities disappear and predators and prey become as one and take the same sustenance. It is understandable that the Israelites of the time, oppressed by Assyrians and Babylonians, would long for a peaceable kingdom. Today, however, it is less understandable – in fact downright baffling — that investment managers who pride themselves on their rationality seem to believe that we live in a world in which physics and economics have gone with the wind, and the lions in their portfolios can prosper on a diet of straw. The conceit I am referring to concerns the voracious lions of artificial intelligence (AI) and the utopian dream of decarbonization. The AI revolution needs the red meat of reliable power – in science-fiction-like quantities – while the decarb dreamers’ windmills and solar panels can deliver only unsatisfying amounts of marginally nutritious straw. Many investment managers own shares of AI leaders[1] such as Nvidia while simultaneously professing a commitment to net zero CO2. This is portfolio management animated more by blind faith than by proven, analytical process. Investors would be wise to question whether they wish to invest with organizations which seem almost willfully ignorant of the performance-sapping implications of this conflicted approach. AI Power Needs — AI’s bottomless appetite for power is no secret. Google “AI need for power” and you will find that banks, corporations, NGO’s, think tanks and major publications are all on the case: These examples are just the tip of the AI power-requirement iceberg. Investment Companies Are Aware of AI’s Power Appetite — Investment management organizations that own AI leaders[8] are certainly cognizant of this coming tidal wave of energy demand: Unlike those whom Jesus’ castigated in the Gospel of Matthew[13]forhaving eyes but refusing to see, these firms understand AI’s growing hunger for electricity. Renewable Inconstancy — It is also no secret that the net-zero utopians’ favorite power sources – wind and solar – are unreliable. In fact, an understanding of the capricious nature of the wind and the effect of clouds on sunshine is so ingrained in our experience that generative AI, whose “intelligence” is fueled by millennia of human poetry and prose, can churn out an endless stream of cliches on the subject such as “love as fleeting as the fickle summer wind” and “troubles like a veil of clouds.” Academics, not satisfied with machine-made similes derived from common knowledge, have felt the need to conduct studies to prove that wind and solar “are inherently highly variable due to volatile weather conditions.”[14] And if age-old wisdom and academic elucidation of the obvious leave any doubt about renewable instability, the UK and Germany have been kind enough to erase it by inadvertently conducting nationwide demonstration projects. These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.[15] In early November of this year, both countries experienced what the Germans call Dunkelflaute (dark doldrums), which arises when high-pressure systems diminish wind and thicken clouds.[16] In the UK, this meant its wind farms were able to meet just 3-4% of the countries’ electricity demand, and in Germany theirs operated at only 7% of capacity.[17] Of course, grid operators had to call on natural gas and coal to step into the breach.[18] Charles Rotter at Watts Up With That? has pointed out that a proposed solution from the UK’s National Energy System Operator to this regular winter issue is “system flexibility”[19] — bureaucratize for public rationing and adjustment of energy usage based on availability. Cooking your dinner early or reading that bedtime novel at 2 pm in anticipation of a calm evening may seem trivial sacrifices to make for the greater good of saving Gaia, but imagine a world in which Dunkelflaute starves a power-hungry AI tasked with the 24/7 running of cybersecurity, healthcare and energy transmission: millions of credit cards compromised by foreign actors, AI-enabled robotic surgeons unable to perform life-saving operations, and the ironic last straw — the meager amount of power being generated by these renewables dies on the vine because the grid is managed by AI. We can’t trust AI with vital, economy-wide duties if it has to rely on gentle breezes and occluded sunshine. Investment Companies Are Aware of Renewable Shortcomings— The research teams at AI-invested portfolio managers are just as aware of renewables’ innate limitations as they are of AI’s appetite for electricity: Inconsistency, variability, intermittency. These investment companies’ analyses of the dependability of wind and solar read like indictments drawn up by Roget’s Thesaurus. Batteries on White Horses — Of course, no investment organizations believe that we can achieve a net zero future that still enables AI with wind and solar alone; as Blackrock has pointed out, these are only a half solution.[24] Continuous dispatchability requires grid-level battery storage. Clearbridge thinks batteries will be an integral part of a renewable infrastructure industry that will achieve compound annual growth rates of 10-30% for the next 30 years.[25] JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Macquarie and Blackrock have all put their money where their mouths are, investing billions in battery storage companies such as Strata Clean Energy, Gridstor, Eku Energy and Waratah.[26] These investment firms are heeding the call of the International Energy Agency (IEA),[27] one of the high priests of net zero. For the IAE, grid-level battery storage will ride to renewables’ rescue like a green savior on Revelations’ white horse,[28] and alchemize the benign but capricious production of turbines and solar panels into ever-dispatchable abundance. Straw Batteries — But how likely is it that battery storage will be renewable’s salvation, and provide the inexpensive, always-on power needed to sustain the AI industry? Mark Mills is a distinguished senior fellow at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a contributing editor at City Journal, a faculty fellow at Northwestern University’s McCormick school of engineering, director of the National Center for Energy Analytics, a former senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, and the author of numerous books and articles on energy and digital technology.[29] I have corresponded with Mark and followed his work for almost 25 years and have found him to be insightful, perspicacious and refreshingly thorough on every subject he turns his mind to. In a rare moment of agreement between Bill Gates and myself, Gates has said that Mark’s book The Bottomless Well “is the only book I’ve ever seen that really explains energy.”[30] In testimony before the U.S. House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, Mark had this to say about grid-level battery storage:[31] Given the almost unfathomable cost and scale of material production required for sufficient grid-level batteries, in all likelihood they are not the magic that will transform wind and solar into the robust energy source AI demands. The Last Straw — This past April, a Wall St. Journal piece explored a seemingly redemptive paradox embedded in the nature of AI: at first glance it looks to explode power usage, but at the same time it holds out the promise that it can increase energy efficiency and thereby reduce consumption.[32] The article focuses on savings in real estate, but the alleged potential is economy-wide. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser believes efficiency gains over the past 15 years – before the advent of AI – have reduced energy demand by the equivalent of 90 million barrels of oil a day.[33] If smart thermostats, electronic sensors in fuel injectors and other relatively crude enhancements have produced this remarkable accomplishment, imagine what the coming AI revolution can achieve through predictive consumption forecasting, renewable energy integration, intelligent grid management and other currently undreamed of wonders! But does Mr. Nasser’s observation about reduced energy demand mean that the world has reduced its energy consumption over the past 15 years? Not according to Our World in Data, which shows overall energy consumption growing by 20% during this period:[34] These last 15 years continue a consistent post-war phenomena: no matter how much we increase vehicle mpg and no matter how many Thermopane windows we install, humanity unfailingly and mysteriously gobbles ever more energy. Only recessions induce power dieting (gold arrows). So is the Saudi Aramco CEO a liar or an ignoramus, or perhaps nefariously spinning the facts to benefit the oil industry? The answer is probably not – on all 3 counts. Most likely, he is referring to efficiency gains in isolation, and neglecting the further consequences of those efficiencies. More energy saving devices and processes would reduce energy consumption if all things remained equal, but we live in a dynamic world where changing inputs leads to unexpected outputs. Imagine in a previous life that you were a blacksmith who specializes in iron plow shares. You’re a brilliant fellow, and you devise a method that burns less wood to generate the heat needed to forge and shape the iron. You subsequently reduce your prices, which means poorer peasants can now afford your plowshares. This leads to more land under cultivation, which creates a burgeoning population, which ignites an ever-greater consumption of the wood needed to meet this expanding market that you and thousands of other imitative smiths are now servicing. And which – depending on your perspective – makes God’s green earth a little more paradisiacal for you and your fellow man, or eventually transforms it into a Boschian hellhole pocked by the pustules of oil derricks, coal mines and fracking and uranium waste. But no matter which way you look at it, your fuel-efficient advancement in metal-working most surely does not reduce energy consumption. All of which leads us to the real paradox regarding AI and power: Jevon’s Paradox. William Stanley Jevons was a British economist who first described this phenomenon in a paper in 1865. It is now so widely known and so well documented that Google’s generative AI app has a synopsis, but I prefer the human insight of Mark Mills: AI will create fuel-usage efficiencies, but it will in turn undoubtedly lead to increased consumption. The Saudi Aramco exec was probably not trying to hoodwink us. As radio host Paul Harvey would have put it, he just didn’t consider “the rest of the story.” Perversely, one man’s energy diet plan begets mankind’s need for an energy feast. Let Them Eat Straw — In spite of their awareness of both AI power requirements and of the fickle nature of wind and solar, in spite of the well-publicized issues with grid-level battery storage, and in spite of the widespread knowledge of Jevon’s Paradox and its implications for the notion that AI-effectuated efficiencies will reduce energy consumption, many investment management organizations continue to demonstrate a deep commitment to a net-zero future and to its proponent organizations: In the investment management community, Clearbridge’s membership in a climate-change organization that promotes decarbonization through wind and solar is not an anomaly. PRI, Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative, Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change, Ceres Investor Network and Climate Action 100+ are 5 of the most prominent of these initiatives. Of the 10 largest fund companies, 9 are signatories to at least one of them, and collectively they hold 31 memberships.[42] Blackrock is a member of four of these outfits, and Blackrock International belongs to the fifth.[43] Blackrock’s Chairman Larry Fink, in a Wall St. Journal op-ed,[44] has called for a capital spending boom to build an “AI transcontinental railroad” that will juice U.S. real economic growth to 3% and increase tax revenues, thereby helping to mitigate the national debt crisis. But nowhere in this article does Mr. Fink mention that his company funds outfits who long to starve the railroad’s engines of fuel. Investment managers’ devotion to decarbonization also manifests itself in their proxy voting records. Each year, Pension Politics analyzes the proxy voting record of investment management companies, based on their votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[45] These are 50 of the most extreme ESG-oriented proposals, 27 of which in 2023 were climate related. These proposals not only require companies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5 degree target, but to report on how their lobbying, insuring and investing activities, and their involvement in trade associations and other alliances, promote decarbonization.[46] At first glance, these proposals appear to be the grassroots efforts of a diverse group of shareholders who are agnostic on the means of achieving net zero (“the strategy on how to achieve this target is entirely up to the Board”).[47] But in fact they are the handiwork of a small number of progressive non-profits such as Green America, As You Sow and the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, all of whom are crusaders for wind and solar.[48] Green America does not try to hide its absolutist advocacy of these so-called renewables: “it is critical to the future of the planet that society moves away from all carbon-producing sources of energy and invests heavily in renewables such as wind, solar, geothermal, and second-generation biofuels.”[49] The other organizations appear to be making a conscious effort to obscure their belief in the role that wind and solar will need to play in the descent to net zero. They use fuzzy, feel-good language, but there can be little doubt that they believe a “just transition to a green economy,” the “phase in of low-carbon energy resources,”[50] and an “equitable energy future” will require an abundance of wind and solar, as evidenced by the many pictures of solar panels and windmills that adorn their web sites.[51] Of the 820 investment outfits Pension Politics graded this year, 520 received a D or F for their proxy votes on the “Fiduciary Free 50.”[52] A major contributing factor to these firms’ poor grades was their collusion with these obscure, radical climate-change zealots to force corporate America to decarbonize. Supposedly the last French queen, Marie Antoinette, when told that her starving peasants had no bread, advised them to eat cake. Though there is no historical evidence that she said this, today there is ample evidence that many investment management organizations, through their support of decarbonization and its handmaidens, are effectively telling the AI lions in their portfolios to eat straw. A Schizophrenic Vision — All investing involves a vision of the future. That vision may originate from a top-down analysis of the economy in which a portfolio manager buys REITs because money supply growth has recently abated, creating the conditions for a snowballing beneficence: inflation will drop, the Fed will lower rates, REIT interest costs will decline, their earnings will increase and their stock prices will climb. Or it may start with a more humble, bottom-up approach: a second manager buys XYZ company because its new CEO will soon jettison the money-losing companies purchased by his profligate predecessor, and return XYZ to its profitable roots. In either case, each of them has envisioned a future friendly to particular stocks or industries, and positioned their portfolios accordingly. But imagine if the first manager buys REITs because of the scenario outlined above, and then pens an opinion piece in the Wall St. Journal urging the Federal Reserve not to lower rates because that will increase inflation. Or if number two buys XYZ and tries to talk the new CEO into maintaining his predecessor’s legacy. A Freudian would call this schizophrenia, while a Christian might invoke the Gospel of Mark to warn that portfolio management divided against itself cannot stand, but they would both probably agree that this is a bizarre, contrary, unworkable approach to making money. The promotion of renewables by AI-owning investment firms is similarly confused. Either AI thrives in a world powered by the proven, reliable bounty of fossil fuels and nuclear fission, or it starves on wind, solar and wishful thinking. In addition — though the full exploration of this is a topic for another day — a decarbonized economy will suffer from low productivity and anemic growth because of renewables’ inefficiency and lack of energy density. This means that nationwide economic growth — the wind at the backs of all companies – will experience its own Dunkelflaute, enfeebling the returns of every investor and every investment organization, not just those that own AI stocks. AI giants such as Microsoft and Google still publicly cling to the hope that they will be carbon-neutral by 2030, in spite of the recent AI-driven upwelling in their consumption of traditional energy. Analysts who see things in the harsh light of day, however, call this dream “ridiculous.”[53] It is high time that the investment management organizations that own these AI operating companies come to this same clear-eyed understanding, and clarify the conflicted vision that shapes their portfolios. They need to either divest themselves of AI or cease to worship at the altar of net-zero. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind.

Type your email… Subscribe Unlike Mr Harrison, policymakers, investors and data center owners (including anyone with any education) are aware of the importance of eliminating CO2 emissions and transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewables and nuclear energy Oh, I see- only stupid people prefer fossil fuels and voted for Trump. I see that attitude all the time, especially here in elitist Wokeachusetts. No nukes here, though- they’ve all been shut down. I said anyone with an education knows about climate change and its solutions. If you know about nuclear, then you know about one important solution. You meant , “any person with an indoctrination”… blah, blah Come on, In what way have humans change global climate change that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? You also need to provide empirical scientific evidence that CO2 has any measurable warming effect. But you will fail again, as you always do. That means you are yapping an ideology you have no evidence for. Religions and cults work that way. There is NO CLIMATE PROBLEM, certainly not from fossil fuels. So no “solution” is required. Nuclear is possible future major energy supply.. Wind and solar are nothing but a parasitic fad. There is absolutely zero need to eliminate CO2 emissions. That is a fallacy which has been brain-washed into gullible twits. CO2 is ALL benefit, no downside. It feeds plant life hence feeds all creatures on the planet. Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming. Fossil fuels have raised modern civilisations and will continue to be a very major source of energy for a long time to come, they cannot be dispensed with if civilisations want to continue to exist. Wind and solar are just a fake parasitic measure to combat a fake anti-CO2 agenda, and are actually one of the most polluting forms of energy over their short life-cycle. “Still waiting for someone to produce some empirical scientific evidence that CO2 causes any measurable warming.” _______________________________________________________________________ Oh they might do that, but then they have to say why ﻿warming is a problem which it isn’t. See #2 on the list: 1. More rain is not a problem. 2. Warmer weather is not a problem. 3. More arable land is not a problem. 4. Longer growing seasons is not a problem. 5. CO2 greening of the earth is not a problem. 6. There isn’t any Climate Crisis. I have searched. I have asked many people to help find that evidence.. … but still, nada, zip.. nothing !! Since you can’t read, think, or speak rationally, I like your posts because there is nothing of substance I have to bother with! As expected… still, nada, zip.. nothing !! … In what way have humans changed the global climate that you can provide solid empirical evidence for? Produce EVIDENCE !!…… or not 😉 That’s rather rich coming from a moron like you! Please specify which of the geologic epochs have lower temperatures and CO2 levels than the Holocene, and just how you propose to prevent the death of ALL LIFE ON EARTH from CO2 starvation during a glacial expansion sometime in the next 1,000,000 years! Your ability to regurgitate corporate propaganda is only exceeded by your ignorance! And you are contradicted by all scientific research worldwide when you claim ‘climate change isn’t a problem’. Read any of the scientific reports from the NAS, the Royal Society, or NASA here: https://climate.nasa.gov The Royal Society? Nullius in verba. Especially them. Sorry, anyone that posts fraudulent graphs as you just have and rejects mainstream science from the National Science Academies, has no credibility with me. Footnote: ‘Present’ on your graph is 1950 by scientific convention, so your graph omits modern era warming from 1950 onward — which is most of it. If you knew that, you are a fraud. Why should anyone care if you think someone else is credible? Self induce Dunning-Kruger effect. You are a nobody, a scientific non-entity. Oooh get you. What’s your title? The central scrutiniser? The supreme arbiter? anyone that posts the nonsense you post is up for the ridicule you so richly deserve. I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. Why would we think you have any credibility? The oceans have ~1,000 X the heat content of the atmosphere, and contain ~60 X the CO2; yet you still believe that a small increase in atmospheric CO2 away from the death threshold for all plant life is of major concern!? Hunh!? You really should avoid the word ‘fraudulent;’ it’s very likely to stick! it’s a 50% increase in atm co2 since 1750. Atm co2 is now the highest in 15 million years And that CO2 has saved the planet from plant starvation. It is a totally and absolutely beneficial increase in CO2 from desperately low level. There is absolutely zero down-side from increasing CO2 to even double or triple what it is today. If you think there is then prove it. First step…. 1… provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or stumble and faceplant on your own BS. Graph is a well know established graph, from well established sources. It is not fraudulent is any way whatsoever. ! YOU ARE AN IGNORANT LIAR. You have 100% negative credibility. ! I caught you for knowingly posting a fraudulent graph. You sound like the all-knowing Karnack of Johnny Carson fame. Sorry to tell you, that was a parody of what you are doing. Show another graph that isn’t fraudulent according to you. There should be plenty of them as you say “mainstream science from the National Science Academies” tells all. I didn’t post any fraudulent graphs. Cite the time stamp. You didn’t post any graphs, And most of what is in your links is provable FAKE by their own data. Planet is still only a tiny bump above the coldest period in 10,000 years. Be every thankful of that. And there is no evidence human CO2 caused that highly beneficial warming. You will prove that, by producing no evidence… Oh look, Beetroot agrees with me. There is no evidence that CO2 causes warming. In the NH the current temperature is probably about on par with 1930s’ Modern warming is nothing but a tiny dot at the end of the chart, level with the left hand end. WB – you obviously do not have a traditional earth science background. The following image may help you get the “modern warming” in perspective. The only questionable figures on this image are the 2050 and 2100 temperature estimates on the right, and even 2050 is not a problem for this planet as it has happened during the Eemian, which is like yesterday in earth history. I have a very traditional science education from a top northeastern US University, and I am very familiar with this graph you’ve posted. It shows a projection that by the end of this century, global temperatures could be higher than they were during the Eemian, 120,000 years ago. What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Nor does it do anything to communicate the effects of such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. You might benefit from a scientific view of the risks that climate change presents to humanity, here: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ The projections shown by the red dots are totally BOGUS and not based on anything but pure conjecture. I replied to your JUNK PROPAGANDA below. !! Showed it was a total load of bollocks backed by absolutely nothing that could be considered remotely scientific. Now.. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Or FAIL yet again. Your credibility is now at negative105% You should ask for a refund for your science education. You don’t seem to have learnt anything at all in those years. ! You are still an ill-informed or nil-informed scientific non-entity. ! There has NOT been a rapid rise in temperature, current level is barely a degree or so above the coldest period in 10,000 years. ! rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia Bullshit. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Your evidence link is nothing but propaganda pap, It contains absolutely zero evidence of anything You climate.gov link is no better. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Or you could just keep posting links to nebulous zero-science propaganda sites, and lower your credibility to -200% Your first statement about rate of warming is totally unsupportable BS. !! There is no way past data is defined enough to show that. In fact, before manic data adjustments the period from 1900-1922 was about the same rate as from 1970 onwards And as YOU have shown many times, there is no empirical evidence at all that humans have caused any of the small amount of highly beneficial warming. You are one of the most MAL-INFORMED fools I have ever come across. !! Not only that, we know from the UAH data that the current warming is NOT because of human CO2,. It is from extra solar energy reaching the tropical oceans, expressing as El Nino spike/steps at semi-regular intervals. There is absolutely no evidence of any human causation. If you think there is, Use UAH data to show us where it is. Think for yourself, not petty regurgitations… if you can find a pair of operable brain cells. Why should I believe your climastrology sites? So you are a Denier. There is NO SCIENCE on those pages. Just nonsense projections from unvalidated computer games. Nothing to “DENY” because they are just fantasy. Warren, two things. Don’t engage.. so he can avoid posting any evidence… as always. ?? So he can post climate nonsense and get away with it ?? —– “I firmly believe CO2 is a GHG and warms the earth” Ahhh.. another anti-science AGW-cultist… you are not a skeptic. Perhaps you would like to try… and fail. 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Oh look, “the hoff”, a silly AGW “believer” runs away presents zero empirical evidence WHY DOES THAT ALWAYS HAPPEN !! “No matter what facts you put in front of him” Beeton has not put forward any actual “facts”. Haven’t you been watching. Neither have you. ! I’m quite prepared to discuss actual scientific evidence. Beeton hasn’t produced any. You know the questions. ! thanks. Four things from me: 1) I did not know that wuwt had a “position” on co2. It’s hard to find any consistent position on anything among skeptics. 2) I rarely engage with Bnice for the reason you state 3) The research behind climate sensitivity estimates is extensive. I’ve seen analysis that shows Even with the lowest values found in the literature, climate change is a severe economic, health and safety risk to humanity, and only a full transition of the global economy to zero carbon emissions by 2050 can avoid very serious effects. 4) I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science. Unfortunately, exceptions like yourself are a rarity on wuwt. Warren, Skeptics are not a homogenous group, but we call ourselves skeptics for the specific reason that that our skepticism revolves around issues like the benefits of mitigation versus adaptation and the severity of alarm that is appropriate. Bnice is an outlier, a vocal minority if you will, but “Denier” remains an odious term which belongs in no civil discourse. Anthony Watts started this blog a long time ago, and his position is that CO2 is a GHG. That was oft stated in the early days of this forum, it has unfortunately not repeated recently. In the early days there were extensive articles with in depth scientific analysis by well known skeptics that showed conclusively that the GHE is real and that CO2 is a GHG. These articles tend to be few and far between these last few years, so we are left with more political articles than the early days which were hardcore science. Even just a basic understanding of Stephen-Boltzmann Law shows that if the GHE is not real and there are no GHG’s, the earth would be snowball earth except perhaps for a stripe around the equator. You are correct that the research behind climate sensitivity is extensive. In decades of research though, the range in sensitivity estimates hasn’t changed much, though more recent papers tend to the lower side, support for the upper range is diminishing rapidly. Estimates for direct effects (3.7w/m2 per doubling) have not changed at all, but the sum total with feedbacks continues to be in dispute, ranging from as low as 1.7 Deg per doubling to 3.0 with the lower end having far more support recently. That, however, isn’t what skeptics are most focused on. The endangerment findings that you find so troubling are predicated on output from models, which have been consistently wrong. They’ve run too hot for decades, all except one. They continue to produce a tropospheric hotspot which has for decades been the “fingerprint” of catastrophe, except it exists ONLY in models, not in real world observations. Second, having paid close attention to the IPCC reports since AR3, there is a disturbing difference between the science itself in the main report and the Summary for Policy Makers, with the latter political documents often unrelated to the actual science. We’ve even seen one lead author demand his name be taken off the SPM for its unjustified alarm. But as the IPCC reports have evolved, each one has been more political than the previous. Consider for example the 1.5 degree “limit”. Where did this number come from? What science underlies it? The answer is none. It was arrived at by “expert opinion” from a group of scientists who are clearly biased toward alarm. I cannot summarize for you the entirety of the skeptic side in a single post, its a very broad topic. But on the issue of alarm, I shall leave you with this: We’ve gone from 280ppm of CO2 to 430, not far off one doubling. During that time, on a global basis, the IPCC has found no discernable trend in hurricanes, floods, droughts or wildfires. The four horsemen of the apocalypse as Forbes put it. What conclusion can we draw from this? If we put the models aside and just focus on data, the lack of a trend over decades doesn’t mean 100% for certain that there is no cause for alarm. But it does raise an important question which I can tell you from 20 years of debating this topic, tends to draw insults and jeers from the alarmists rather than any sober discussion of the facts. The question is, if the earth’s climate is so sensitive, so prone to unleashing climate fury upon the planet, why is there no sign in the data, collected over decades, of the deleterious effects? How can he climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2? Further, as CO2’s effects are logarithmic (hence the practice of quoting sensitivity in Deg C per doubling) each additional ppm of CO2 has less effect than the one before it. So the best conclusion that we can draw based on the data is that catastrophic changes in weather are not only insensitive to CO2 increase, they get less sensitive to each additional ppm. I wrote this article for WUWT about 9 years ago. Its has since been moved to different servers a couple of times so the formatting is screwed up. The links are also broken for the most part as the IPCC has moved their stuff around a lot too. Yes it is AR5 and the most recent report is AR6, I did say it was a 9 year old article. But the conclusions are still clear and easily read. The reason that I share it with you here is that as of AR5, it was VERY CLEAR from the IPCC’s main report (in other words the actual science, not the SPM) that there is no cause for alarm. Climate Change comes in dead last in nearly every category in terms of what the major effects on the human condition are likely to be in the future. https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/01/01/we-have-bigger-problems-than-climate-change-so-sayeth-ipcc-ar5/ In fact, Richard Tol, lead author on multiple iterations of the IPCC reports shows up in comments on this article. One of his comments pertains to his reason for withdrawing from the SPM of his own chapter. No need for you to take me at my word. You can read it for yourself. There is also no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2 in any IPCC creation. It is all just conjecture and supposition. Would you care to provide that empirical evidence. Or just ignore the fact that you can’t, and go on “believing” like a good little AGW-cultist A whole lot of regurg. but still no empirical scientific evidence. A big FAIL !! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Other than the most basic theory of climate science –the GHE– I find most of your implied call for no action or minimal action unsupported in the scientific literature. Eg: 1) The latest IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) estimates equilibrium climate sensitivity is likely between 2.5°C and 4.0°C and very likely between 2.0°C and 5.0°C. The best estimate for ECS remains at 3°C. In order to safeguard the atmosphere and climate, responsible risk management requires insuring against the more severe of possible outcomes, not the mean. That implies mitigation policy based on an ECS between 3 and 4, possibly 5. Using an ECS less than 3C would be irresponsible risk management, and gambling with earth’s life support system. 2) Some models have run ‘hot’, but of course the IPCC is fully aware of this, and considers the ensemble of models with and without the hot models included. At the end of the day, for AR6 the IPCC has decided not to increase the upper end of IPCC ECS estimates in AR5 — which after all are not based on models alone, but also on paleoclimate data, as well as current warming trends. 3) It is untrue to claim, as you do, that none of the impacts of climate change have shown up. Clearly they have, and they are so identified and documented by the IPCC as effects based on current data, not on modeling. 4) Also, it is flawed logic to claim, as you do that because some impacts of climate change are not yet showing statistical significance, that they should be dismissed from a threat assessment. Modeling is based on real data and the physical behavior of earths climate system, and many of the models do indeed accurately reproduce the current warming trend. Disregarding future impacts based on those models would be irresponsible. 5) In your last paragraph you say, “How can the climate be hyper-sensitive to changes in CO2 while also showing no changes to increases in CO2?” AR6 is replete with examples that make that an absurd claim. As I said earlier, each iteration of the IPCC reports had become more political than the previous. I spend little time these days on IPCC reports. If I delve into something I delve into the papers upon which the reports are supposedly based. I find little alarming in them. The IPCC is a UN construct, and like many UN constructs, corrupt to the core. Their purpose is to grow their organization, their funding, and their power. If they were to proclaim that there is no cause for alarm, they would instantly be out of jobs. An executive position at the UN pays on the order of $700K per year. The incentive for alarm is obvious. Hence my focus on the actual papers than their conclusions. Sensitivity in the range of 5.5 Deg C per doubling is pure garbage. If it was that high would would see it leaping out of the data. But we don’t, we can barely tease the warming signal out of natural variability. As for the impacts, I did not say none have shown up. Its getting warmer. It doesn’t matter which temperature series you want to look at, its getting warmer. UAH, RSS, HadCrut, etc it is warmer now that it was 100 years ago. No doubt about it. That doesn’t change the fact that there are no discernable trends in the exact things we should be most worried about. Tree lines moving north is real, and not at all alarming. More arable land, not alarming. Island atolls aren’t being swamped by sea level rise, they are getting larger. Agricultural output has sky rocketed, outpacing population increases without using more land. For every heat related excess death we are seeing 10+ lives saved from excess cold. If you look at nothing but negative effects, you have reason for alarm. If you look at ALL the effects, it turns out that there are a lot of positives. In fact, the heights of civilization all coincide with the Medieval, Roman and Minoan warming periods. In fact history books record them as climate optimums. You might be able to convince me that we’re as warm now as the Medieval warming period, but the Roman and Minoan warming periods were absolutely warmer than it is now. As for irresponsible risk management, allow me to point out two things: I’m going to have a little fun with bnice blow, you might want to follow along just to be amused. A little fun with your headless chook routine showing absolutely zero empirical evidence. RUN AWAY again.. post a load of irrelevant regurg… Hilarious. ! Making a compete joke of yourself ??? What a load of low-end kamal-speak. Absolute GIBBERISH !! Pertaining to absolutely nothing but the stupid opinions of a manic AGW -cultist. Andreas not Antonius. I should review more before hitting the post button. First, I want to thank you for your professionalism and polite dialogue That’s a rarity on WUWT, and some, like BNICE, are so deep into their silos of rage and fact denial that they are often, as you say, ‘hoist on their own petard’. Now to your most recent reply to me: 1) I am a bit disappointed in your first paragraph — instead of dealing with the science, you attack motives of the IPCC, which is tasked with summarizing the work of the thousands of scientists and hundreds of scientific institutions around the world that have conducted and published the original research. If the IPCC is as corrupt as you say, you should be able to show where its conclusions deviate from the published peer reviewed science it’s based on. Many Deniers and skeptics I encounter attack motives or claim corruption and make no effort (or no competent effort) to debunk the research they criticize. That tells me they can’t justify their position and are driven by emotion, not reasoning. 2) You call an ECS of 5 (which is characterized by the IPCC as ‘likely’, not ‘very likely’, ie, the tail of the probability distribution) as pure garbage. But you don’t demonstrate why it’s pure garbage. Unsupported assertions don’t make the case. 3) Re: impacts — see my earlier posting on this point — you cannot justify leaving out the modeled threats. I would add that your claim civilization is enhanced by the warming trend also cannot be justified. First, it’s not only the high level of future temperatures that will harm us — it is the high RATE of warming that is a major concern. E.g., most modern population centers are along seacoasts. The potential for a sea level rise of 25 feet or more in 150 years carries with it catastrophic consequences for those cities. And dont tell me you can calculate the rise to be less — because you cannot rigorously calculate future ice loss — one can only estimate tail risks. And we mitigate against tail risk, not for the mean of probability. 4) You say mitigation strategies are a waste of money. That is the biggest mistake in all of your postings. Solar wind and nuclear are all viable technologies, and the last two are being aggressively deployed across the world. And if you believe solar and wind are not viable, you should tell that to the world’s utilities who are using renewables for over 80% of new generating capacity as they expand their grid systems. And your point that energy required to manufacture these products will emit vast amounts of CO2 is just plain silly — those energy sources can ultimately be renewable as well — or be nuclear power, also zero emission technology. 5) Finally, I find your argument about risk to be flawed. Risk = probability times consequence. You insure your home when the risk of total destruction is well less than 5%. Yet we are dealing with humanity’s life support system — and a probability of harm that is estimated at 95% by the IPCC. So you cannot tell me we should use an ECS much less than the mean of 3C for designing mitigation policy. 6) Finally, if someone like yourself wants to put forth a credible case climate change is not a high risk for humanity, and/or that mitigation should not be attempted, they should submit their ideas in the form of scientific papers to a respected scientific journal. The fact that there are tens of thousands of peer reviewed papers that form the basis of the IPCC’s work products, but NOT ONE (to my knowledge) that makes the case ECS is as low as you say, or that an ECS less than 3 should be used for policy, convinces me that the Skeptics and Deniers have it wrong, and the body of scientific and economic literature has it right. I despise you AGW hoaxers for trying to deprive me of methane, gasoline and diesel, and for forcing me to pay your stupid battery cars. Stuff your corrupt journal papers where there is no sunshine. Your children and grandchildren will thank those concerned citizens who worked to preserve the world for them to enjoy, and they will forget those who closed their eyes to the unanimous, and overwhelming scientific consensus, that climate change was caused by the burning of fossil fuels and represented a serious threat to humanity. Again, just waffling irrelevant gibberish… and mal-information. …. with no empirical evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Why is that? The models are a load of unphysical garbage filled with errors and unproven suppositions. They are little more than computer games. IPCC can make all the estimates of ESC they want, but they are all based on models that don’t remotely represent the atmosphere. There is no evidence ESC is anything but zero. It is massively irresponsible to waste billions of dollars based on erroneous garbage models while destroying electricity grids and the environment. AR6 is a political document voted on by representatives of some 129 countries. If the summary report disagrees with the science reports, it is mandated the science reports change. I’ve worked with scientists and laymen who worked on the IPCC. What you say is false. You still haven’t present one bit of peer-reviewed science to back up anything you have said. You cannot even say what I “deny” that you can present actual empirical science to back You have zero credibility, because you are also totally clueless what journal peer-review even means or does. Here is some peer-reviewed science do you DENY the result? 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ found tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Seems YOU ARE A DENIER under your own description. Hi Bnice200, thanks for posting that. So, after insisting that there is NO empirical evidence to show that CO2 has ANY warming effect, you’ve now posted evidence that falsifies your own assertion. Hoisted on your own petard as they say. If we are to believe the 8 Taiwanese engineers you cite, take them completely at their word, assume their calculations are 100% accurate, then CO2 in fact DOES have a warming effect. Per your cite, going from 100ppm to 400ppm has a warming effect of 0.3 Deg C. Which means according to YOUR cite, all the rubbish you have cluttered up the threads with about there being no empirical evidence to show that CO2 has any warming effect at all are rubbish. Crap. Bull sh*t. You’ve just admitted that there IS an effect. Its not zero. They will not be the first to suggest a very low sensitivity, nor will they be the last. The point is that it is not zero as you claim. They start out though by “tripling” CO2 concentration from 100 to 400 ppm. They appear to have a math problem, that is quadrupling, not tripling. Then they make the astounding claim that there’s no additional warming from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. Well if there is measurable warming from 100 to 350, then NO warming from 350 to 400 is physically impossible. So what game did they play to arrive at that conclusion? Well, they limited the calculations to 5 years. So they got a number so small that they rounded it off to zero. The real world doesn’t end in 5 years. But bottom line is they showed that CO2 in fact does have an effect, and all your blathering is wrong. Want some more empirical evidence? Here is a real experiment. A 10 cm long tube with IR transparent windows at each end is filled with an artificial atmosphere with 2.6 % water vapour and 357 ppm of CO2. They shine a known IR source in one end, and measure exactly what comes out the other end. Then they double the CO2 concentration and do it again. Their conclusion? 0.054w/m2. Very small, but most definitely NOT zero, read it for yourself: http://www.john-daly.com/artifact.htm Now let me explain why that conclusion is WAY too low. To get an actual result that is accurate using this methodology, you’d have to build an apparatus the height of the troposphere. Not practical, but the point being that you’d need thousands of these 10 cm tubes end to end and the total effect would be cumulative. Secondly, there is no ocean in this experiment, or a whole lot of other things that exist in the real world. In the real world increased temps promote more evaporation into an atmosphere that can hold more water, which is also a GHG. Feedbacks are real. Thanks for playing along, your apology is accepted. David H. is partially right when he points to a warming effect due to CO2. It was shown in the referenced paper which is likely from the same cause as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper. https://www.windtaskforce.org/profiles/blogs/german-researcher-doubling-of-atmospheric-co2-causes-only-0-24-c The cause is the widening of the 15 µm absorption window for CO2. This effect was also mentioned in the work by Wijngaarden and Happer. The problem is this is only part of the story. There is also an induced cooling effect by CO2 which appears to be of about the same strength. I’ve mentioned this in the past. It is caused by the increase in IR radiation at the surface leading to additional evaporation and enhanced convection (first mention by Dr. William Gray). As a result, Bnice turns out to be correct. There is no warming from increases in CO2 even going back to 100 ppm. (we could see some warming at less than 100) The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. If you want to pick nits, CO2 has an absorption band in the downwelling solar radiance. At surface this completely get swamped by water vapour, but at high altitude and high latitude it is cold, very little water vapour. So in theory CO2 in fact has a cooling effect too. Fun fact, there are winds that blow high in the atmosphere over Antarctica that are warmer than the surface below. So the net effect of CO2 there is to intercept downwelling photons from the warm winds and then xfer the energy either by collision or emission. So the “greenhouse effect” is actually reversed in Antarctica. Keep that in mind when you see some warming event in Antarctica being blamed on CO2. “Net positive feedback.” Again, a load of baseless supposition. Never proven. And if there is no CO2 signal , there is no feedback. So…. Still waiting for you to present some empirical scientific evidence of CO2 warming the atmosphere. All you have so far is empty waffle.. The additional evaporation results in an increase in water vapour, which is a GHG. Net positive feedback. Sorry, this is simply not true. You are missing the effects of saturation and convection. The increase in water vapor only occurs low in the atmosphere where all the energy available to H2O is already being absorbed, aka saturation. Can’t cause any warming there. The increase has the added effect of increasing buoyancy. This ends up driving convective currents higher into the colder troposphere which increases condensation. As a result you have less residual water vapor exactly where saturation is no longer in effect. This occurs primarily in the Tropics and then is carried by the Hadley circulation to the higher latitudes. The reduced water vapor ends up allowing more energy to radiate to space thus a cooling effect. The extra energy that was captured low in the atmosphere due to the widening of the absorption window is basically what is sent high in the troposphere as latent heat of the extra evaporation. This is the energy that now has an easier time getting to space. This is one of the non-obvious effects that have fooled most scientists, so don’t feel bad. There are more. You have a fundamental misconception. Or perhaps several. Heat transfer beyond earths system cannot occur by conduction or convection — only by radiative heat transfer. And the ghe is never saturated. That mistake was first made by Angstrom in the 19th century, but corrected by Arrhenius and all other researchers since then. Warren, such massive ignorance in one short comment. It’s no wonder you have zero credibility. Go read my more detailed description to David and learn. Detailed or not, the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative. Convection and conduction only cause heat exchange WITHIN earth’s system, and cannot cause global warming or cooling the only heat transfer mechanism that can move energy out of earth’s system is radiative Which is exactly what I said in my more detail description. However, the process which drove the increase in radiative energy loss started with increased evaporation. Once again it becomes obvious that you have almost no basic understanding of science. a) The body of scientific literature , as reflected in the IPCC summary, concludes an ECS mean of 3C. We await your publication of a contrary analysis in a peer reviewed scientific journal. “as the 0.24 C per doubling reference by Wilpost in another paper.” Which for a small increase in CO2 in the last 100 or so years would lead to a totally immeasurable amount, totally swamped by natural variability. There is no cooling effect from co2. Evaporation does not transfer heat to outer space so cannot affect earths heat content. Poor Hoff.. the rabid AGW-cultist. ! Doesn’t understand the words “ no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm.” Then an experiment that cuts out convection, conduction and air movement so it no longer even remotely resembles the atmosphere. How much more stupid can you get !! And a call to the fallacy of WV feedback A complete FAIL !! It was not an experiment. It was a model. Its in the first effing paragraph of the description, FFS. You know what? Eff off. I’m putting you back on ignore. Calling ME a rabid AGW cultist is as ignorant and insult as one can get. I’ve authored well over a dozen articles for WUWT challenging the entire CAGW premise. I’ve dissected IPCC reports, I wrote damning articles calling out the hypocrisy in the leaked AR5 pre print which then disappeared from the final version. I’ve written for other skeptic forums, I have in fact risked my career by publicly refuting the CAGW thesis as I write under my own name. Do you have the guts to write under your own name? I am betting you do not. You’re just a troll whose only argument is to say anything that s shown to you is invalid. You clutter up threads with the same blather over and over. You are convincing no one except perhaps yourself. I actually feel rather sorry for you. Set/Bnice=Ignore The fact that you think an enclosed tube in any way represents the atmosphere, really does indicate the low level of your scientific understanding. Apparently you missed the entire part of the post where I explained exactly that? Do the words you disagree with just disappear while you are reading them? Or do you read them and then delete them from your brain? Ask me if I care about your stupid labels, shillboi. “So you are a Denier.” So you are a troll. I’m also a denier. Now you just have to figure out what I deny. Good luck! That is hate speach. What’s not accurate about this? “I use the word Denier with those who, like Bnice, refuse to accept facts or the conclusions of peer reviewed science” Which is a totally meaningless description when you are totally incapable of producing any peer-reviewed science. If you say I “deny” something you must be able to produce precise empirically based science to prove the thing you say I deny. So far you have failed absolutely and completely You have also shown that you are totally clueless what “peer-review” actually is. !! You are just a mouth, with no brain driving it. Denier is hate speech. Poor baby — buck up; when you finish 6th grade science, you’ll be able to understand your betters. One of the issues that I have noticed with “traditional science education” is a lack of teaching of “traditional earth science”. In my day, there was a School of Applied Geology. That faculty no longer exists, and geology is a bit player in the school of Environmental Science. This lack of traditional earth science teaching and understanding leads to statements such as: What the graph does not show is that the rate of global temperature rise is faster than at any time in millennia. Are you certain that is the case? NASA only goes back to 1880. The only other long term record is that for Central England which goes back to the 1600’s, but the data integrity is often questioned. The next alternative are temperature estimates from ice cores, with data points +/- a thousand years. Having another look at the CET data, it seems that a similar warming rate may have happened during the 1700’s. “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature What do you find in the links that you disagree with? If so, why? Links aren’t working.. Both links work for me. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no data provided on any of your links to support this statement. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: ” The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 “ go back to the link and read footnote 1. You love your propaganda pap, don’t you beetroot. Quite pathetic that you think it is actual science, though !!. Not surprised that you can’t tell the difference between a bald-faced LIE, and actual science though. Let’s watch your squirm away in avoidance.. yet again… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Pre data adjustment…. graph didn’t attach…. And according to GISP data there have been several periods in the Holocene where warming was just as steep over a much large increase than current. Note, according to Mann the bottom of the current warming starts in 1850, so the end of the graph would be around the 1930s, very similar temperatures to now. My issue is with the claim that current (global) warming rates (ie 1960 to present) of about 0.24 DegC/decade is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. There is no forensic method available to estimate such rates for a ~60 year period prior to about 1880. It rings my sciency alarm bells. BTW, I’m with you on nuclear! There is plenty of scientific literature explaining how proxy data,with error bars, allow for this determination. The NASA footnote cites AR6 Except you didn’t produce it. We can assume you have never read it while thinking. Just swallowed the nonsense hook line and sinker. You don’t look very deeply. In the first section , read this statement, and footnote 1 referencing AR6: You do realize that AR6 conclusions are based solely upon correlations and not causation don’t you? Again, you say you are trained in science, yet you use correlation as your proof? That is not scientific! I don’t believe you have the qualifications or competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the body of peer reviewed science. You are obviously totally lacking in any qualifications or scientific education. What you “believe” is totally irrelevant and has well below zero credibility. There is not data provided anywhere. it is all just mindless propaganda. This is what beetroot builds his case on.. NON-science nonsense. I have replied to this propaganda nonsense further down. That you seem to think it contains anything remotely scientific is a very sad indictment of the your education in science. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. From your NASA link : Takeaways While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years. … … The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.

[ Reference 1 ] … … References References 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary 1. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report, WGI, Technical Summary OK, so it goes from a headline precise “in the past 10,000 years” to a more vague “over many recent millennia” in the main text, and just provides a reference to the (112 page PDF file) AR6 WG-I assessment report’s “Technical Summary” chapter. . In the “Introduction” to the TS there is a “Selected Updates and/or New Results since AR5” sub-section, in which we find (on page 41, bold in the original, underlining added by me) : Paleoclimate evidence: The AR5 assessed that many of the changes observed since the 1950s are unprecedented over decades to millennia. Updated paleoclimate evidence strengthens this assessment; over the past several decades, key indicators of the climate system are increasingly at levels unseen in centuries to millennia and are changing at rates unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years. (Box TS.2, Section TS.2) The IPCC AR6 WG-I TS document referenced by the NASA webpage says “the last 2000 years”, not 10,000. Attached at the end of this post is a screenshot of panel a of Cross-Section Box TS.1, Figure 1, which can be found on page 61. URL to IPCC original : https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/technical-summary/ts-ccbox-1-figure-1/ You will note that it repeats the “in a rate unprecedented in at least the last 2000 years” number, neither “10,000” nor “many (recent) millennia”. You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. . Your NASA “supporting evidence” link does not actually support your parroting of its “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Datasets with resolutions of “centuries” cannot be used to calculate “rates of warming” for periods of decades (/ “50 years”). Please try again. I Said “millennia”. 2000 is two millennia. This is lame even for you, shillboi. Mark had the receipts and this is all you can manage. Mark has no idea what data NASA has. Until he discusses with NASA, or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn, he hasn’t debunked anything. I trust NASA, not armchair deniers. … or reads the original journal papers from which the conclusion was drawn … My bad, it was “obvious” to me on looking through the “supporting evidence” list that only the “AR6 WG-I TS” reference could potentially be relevant, so I only showed how that one did not include a “in the past 10,000 years” qualifier.

Conclusion There is absolutely nothing whatsoever in the list of “References” supplied by NASA to support their headline “in the past 10,000 years” bald assertion. Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). Prove me wrong. Provide a citation to the specific paragraph(s) in any of the “References” on that webpage that includes the character string “the past 10,000 years” (or “ten millennia” ?). You’ll find that is why Beeton, nyolci, and other trolls never, ever show the EVIDENCE they refer to. Only that the evidence exists in papers from the experts. I’ve caught the them in inaccurate quotes by checking the papers they happen to refer to. What a joke. Good work! You could be right. You could be wrong if you’ve missed something. I don’t know. But I do know this, posted by NASA, is from the IPCC recent assessment: “Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age: I also believe this statement, from NASA, is undeniable: “The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia. It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.” You will also note that the “Resolution:” for data before 1000AD is in “Centuries” … which makes it completely useless when comparing paleoclimate datasets to the warming rate “Over the last 50 years“. Thanks for your forensic work Mark. It is a sad day when NASA allows unverified statements on their websites. ﻿ Nice write up Mark. One of the first things that triggered my BS meter was reading AR4 and coming across a value and wondering where it came from. The reference would be to a previous AR which would then reference a paper which would then reference another paper which would inevitably be behind a paywall. Accept their number or spend a fortune finding out where it came from. Why the obvious effort to shroud the source of a value used across multiple AR’s? I discovered that other people were asking the same questions and getting the run around. The second was the steadfast refusal to share data and methods. You’ll just try and find something wrong with it complained Hanson. Well isn’t that the whole point of science? Trying to find errors? The fate of humanity lies in the balance and these clowns are afraid we’ll find errors? If we did find errors, would that not be a cause for celebration, the world not ending after all? Or if we didn’t find errors it would prove them right, isn’t that what they want, for us to believe them? I got banned from multiple “science” sites for asking those questions. NASA global data back to 1850 is a manically distorted fabrication of homogenised urban heat effect surface data,. It is totally meaningless as a measure of global temperature change Central England is regional –not the world. “such a rapid rise in global temperatures on humans or on our health, environment, migration patterns, droughts, storm disasters and infrastructure to name but a few of the areas affected. “ NONE of which actually exist in real data, except the highly beneficial temperature rise since the LIA. Warmth enhances health. 10X more people die from cold as from heat, life expectancy has increased massively due to warming and the products and use of fossil fuels. Environment.. the whole planet is much greener.. is that a bad thing. Only thing destroying the environment is wind and solar factories. Migration patterns are never set in stone. No trend in droughts.. Cold causes more droughts than warmth does. No trend (maybe slightly downwards) in storms or cyclones/hurricanes except the silly naming thereof. No increase in disasters, except where people build on flood plains etc. Infrastructure .. nope… you have nothing. So.. just another load of fake mantra pap from you. ! Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. How many years does each dot on the graph cover? How do you determine the rate of change when a single point covers a century or a millennia. If you had a proper science education, you would know how to interpret time series graphs. Apparently you missed that day at school! Beetroot doesn’t seem to have any science background whatsoever !! And he has to resort to spamming to prop up his lies. Oh dear…the beetroot falls for on-line propaganda pap, yet again !! And there it is. As always the warmists ultimately rely on the “argument from authority” fallacious position rather than providing evidence that supports their claims. They rather believe that there are experts who can be relied on to tell them what the facts are because that’s what they are told by – you know -really smart people. For Mr. Beeton’s information, many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent. You cannot claim to be well educated on a subject unless you’ve thoroughly researched and considered all sides. I’ve only ever seen what I believe to be truly objective research on the climate change issue from what are called skeptics. “many of us have read these reports and papers, looked closely at the methods and data and researched other information and data and found them to be unconvincing, biased and sometimes fraudulent.” So, since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research, every one of the 270 scientific institutions in the world, all University textbooks on Atmospheric Physics, and nearly every single researching climate scientist in the world contradict Deniers — who have no consistent theory to explain the warming of the planet — I consider your position to be untenable in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. since 99.9% of all peer reviewed research Liar. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-change Agree…. so what… because they get funding NOT ONE OF THEM provides scientific evidence that it does. If you think one does, then point to the exact one. That means you will have to read them all to find it exists… .. instead of posting links you are totally clueless about.. Modelled crap does not count. Noted, yet again you RUN AWAY. so funny to watch your headless chicken routine. 🙂 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. “problematic relationship with facts” And you have ZERO or negative relationship with facts. !! You run and hide from them. ! Noted that YET AGAIN you are totally incapable of supporting the very basis of your cult-religion Hilarious headless chicken routines to avoid the fact. You have NEVER read a book on Atmospheric Physics, you do not have a capability to understand it. The scientific incompetence is totally YOURS. Prove me correct , yet again.. !! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. Your credibility is now at negative 220% Try again.. see if you can present something with any credibility.. or FAIL ! 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. 2… Please show the evidence of CO2 warming in the UAH atmospheric data. So just an appeal to “more and bigger” authorities? Perhaps you are unaware that all those scientific institutions represent mostly academic researchers highly dependent on massive government grants for their livelihood and those grants only go to those who support the approved narrative. Are you, by chance, one of them? You don’t even seem to know how bogus the 99% [97%] consensus argument is. You need to read more widely. He’s just regurgitating the talking points he’s been handed. “in the face of overwhelming evidence” You haven’t produced any actual scientific evidence. !! 8 Taiwanese Engineers Determine The Climate Sensitivity To A 300 ppm CO2 Increase Is ‘Negligibly Small’ tripling atmospheric CO2 from 100 ppm to 400 ppm produces a “negligibly small” 0.3°C warming effect. This temperature change is only associated with the increase from 100 ppm to 350 ppm and includes no additional warming as CO2 rises from 350 ppm to 400 ppm. You can DENY or ignore.. We know who the real “deniers” are. Another way of looking at this is to consider the hubris — and scientific incompetence–of someone who believes he’s found fundamental errors in the work of nearly every climate scientist on the planet. There is part of your problem. You have obviously not done a deep dive into your science education. Have you never been taught something by a professor and found it in error. Yet it has been propagated to many students through booksand papers the professor has written. How many text books still contain the Micheal Mann debunked hockey stick? As a student if you are taught this and never research it depth, you’ll never know it is based on suspect statistics. How many textbooks can you find that show empirical data substantiating the effective warming potential of CO2 as a cold body compared to the surface? How many textbooks deal with the subject using calculus to integrate the variations in day, month, annual orbital equations? How many just use averages and time series correlation? How many have a functional relationship between CO2 and surface temperature rather than just graphical time series? Climate science has not progressed into science yet. That is what makes me skeptical. Like it or not climate science is still at the alchemy stage of development still trumpeting that “We have found the way to make CO2 the control knob”! Youve now convincingly demonstrated you have neither the qualifications nor competence to claim you’ve found fundamental errors in the peer reviewed scientific literature. You know absolutely NOTHING about peer-review, do you. ! Totally ignorant as to what it even means. You are LYING about having ever done any science. 100 scientists can agree with me, but it only take 1 to prove I am wrong. Who said that, again? Even if a ‘green’ future is necessary there are two fallacies in place. (1) Lack of due process (2) You can’t throw a switch, which, of course, you might learn with due process. No fallacies required. First, all climate policy are and must be carried out constitutionally by legislation or by constitutional executive orders. Second, no policymakers advocate ‘throwing a switch’. Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. But fallacies are all you have.! There is no transition underway in any country that isn’t destroying it economy World fossil fuel use remains around 80% of world energy use, wind and solar are a tiny slice, barely visible on the graph below. There is absolutely zero need to move away from fossil fuels to unreliable, erratic, intermittent parasitic low-integrity energies like wind and solar. Yes there is a transition, well underway in the world, including the US, EU, Japan, and China. EVs are in production, and more in development, 80% of new power generation capacity being installed is solar wind or nuclear, and funding and incentives from legislation is already helping to build out infrastructure. In addition, 42 countries are considering, or already have in place, a carbon tax. Also, this year the EU has implemented a new border carbon adjustment mechanism that will incentivize trade with countries that have a carbon tax. Lots happening, so you need to pay attention if you want to have credibility in your comments. Data says otherwise. Fossil fuel growth continues to outstrip wind and solar That 80% is really less than 20% when considering capacity factors.. sorry if you are too dumb to realise that. The largest countries in the world continue to massively increase their fossil fuel energy use. Countries CANNOT survive or progress without fossil fuels.. period. ! You rely totally on them every day of your pitiful existence. Drive a battery car yet, beetman? If no, you’re a hypocrite. If yes, you’re a sucker. so that makes you….uneducated Noted , yet again, the total lack of anything remotely related to scientific evidence. You ran away from answering, just like all the other AGW shills. I wonder if he parks and charges his pretend EV in an attached garage. He is dumb enough to do that. ! BOOM! Goes the Chinese EV. Have you come to grips with the fact that indeed global temperatures are rising at the fastest rate in millennia? “While Earth’s climate has changed throughout its history, the current warming is happening at a rate not seen in the past 10,000 years.” https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/evidence/ and: https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-global-temperature Spamming is all you got in the tank, shillboi. Totally destroyed above. They are just regurgitated propaganda fakery with zero scientific content. I meant “below” Exactly — and he can’t even regurgitate the 97% propaganda correctly. You have a problematic relationship with facts, it seems: https://news.cornell.edu/stories/2021/10/more-999-studies-agree-humans-caused-climate-changeG The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there? You say, “The climatology literature is corrupt, why do you believe what is in there?” I say, “Your statement is pure Science Denial” Yes, fool. the climate peer-review nonsense is TOTALLY CORRUPT. Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. Cornell?

How moronically stupid can you get !!! Please see my response timestamped “December 23, 2024 4:28 am” to one of your other copies of this post in this comments section. Nope. But given that we have recently (past couple hundred years or so) emerged from one of the coldest eras in modern history, I am grateful for every 0.1 C improvement. Besides, that 10000 year bogus claim was debunked in a prior post. It is not a fact. It is a speculative claim with minimal supporting data and note that the sources are all government websites that are obliged to tow the line of Presidential policy. If you bothered to read Biden’s 5 year climate report and compare it to AR6, you would recognize that glossy piece of propaganda for what it is. So you are endorsing either the US 5 Year Climate Report, or AR6, or both? Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % Data makes you look like a brain-washed idiot. !. ! There is no “transition”.. period —– Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China Get over it, beetroot. ! Each and every scheme a scam. https://www.youtube.com/@Bernie-is-Artemis Marxist. …. and a completely indoctrinated gormless twit. ! …the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway. This is pure fantasy. Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions. Look at the various COPs and at progress (or lack of it) on the Paris agreements. The plain fact is, no-one outside of the English speaking countries and Germany has taken global warming seriously, and the countries that have tried to reduce their emissions from electricity generation are right now seeing themselves approaching the cliff of intermittency. And not liking it, getting very alarmed, and getting ready for U-turns. As will happen in February in the US. The other countries are just growing their economies as fast as possible, and letting emissions and coal use go where they may. “Don’t see any sign of either a common global goal or a transition. Look at the track record of China and India on coal use and emissions”. China’s goal is to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. and they are well on their way,,ahead of most countries including the US. Coal Use Hits Record High in 2024 Thanks to India and China. wind and solar in China are barely visible in the energy chart They now have a working pebble bed nuclear, those will expand rapidly, and wind and solar will be left to rot. ! Not one nation has a chance of meeting their FAKE goals. Wind and solar make up a very small part of China’s energy usage, they have had hydro for a long time. EV’s in China make sense, crowded huge cities… anything is better than those old 2 cycle motor bikes., and the COAL fired power they will run is well out of the cities. Places like USA and America EVs are basically just a low-level second car or virtue-seeking of very little actual use. Plans, stated to fool twits like you and your mates.. works every time… … yet their use of coal grows year one year. The others are just gimmicks to fool the western world into sticking with the idiotic net-zero plan to destroy their manufacturing bases. It will fail in the USA now Trump is in, because he will aim fossil fuel self-dependency in a very short time 😆 “dropping by more than 80% by 2060.” By then, all their current coal fired power stations will be still running at high efficiency. Current wind and solar will have ceased to function and be in scrap heaps or left to rot. Why always portray new renewable energy sources with capacity rather than actual production of energy? World wide renewable energy production is about 20% of stated capacity. Combined renewable wind and solar with 100 Giga-watts of capacity over time have average output of about 20 Giga-watts of energy. Because it is the only way they can keep the hoax alive. shillboi — praising his marxist masters and earning his keep. There are only 195 nations of which 193 are part of the UN. If China is so great, why not move there? There is such thing as “constitutional executive orders.” https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46738 “Executive orders are written instruments through which a President can issue directives to shape policy. Although the U.S. Constitution does not address executive orders and no statute grants the President the general power to issue them, authority to issue such orders is accepted as an inherent aspect of presidential power, though their legal effect depends on various considerations.” Yes, presidential executive orders are constitutional when they are supported by the Constitution or authorized by Congress: Executive orders are a way for the president to set policy without waiting for Congress to pass legislation. They have the force of law unless they are voided or revoked by Congress, the president, or the judicial branch. So Warren, why are you using FF every day? And I bet you have no solar panels on the roof. If you are going to talk the talk then you better walk the walk. Do not be a hypocrite. So Jim, do you need to read this in my post? “ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway” I’m doing my share — including lobbying my Congressional representative and Senators to pass climate legislation. What are you doing, Jim? “I’m doing my share” Yep, you continue to use fossil fuels every second of every day. Trump is in now.. All this anti-CO2 nonsense will disappear. Drill baby, drill ! 🙂 ““ Rather, the common goal is to transition the economy to net zero carbon emissions by 2050 — and the transition is already underway”” 1… NOT underway, fossil fuels % is holding steady and is still BY FAR the main energy supply 2… Politically and idiotology based wishful thinking and propaganda. The Anti-CO2 nonsense will be dead and buried by 2050. Harold the Organic Chemist Says ATTN: Warren RE: CO2 Does Not Cause Warming Of Air. To refresh your memory, shown below in the graphic are plots of temperatures from the weather station at Furnace Creek in Death Valley from 1922 to 2001. In 1922, the concentration of CO2 was 303 ppmv (0.6 g of CO2/ cu. m. of air), and, by 2001 it had increased to 371 ppmv (0.7 g/cu. m. of air), but there was no corresponding increase in the air temperature. The reason for no temperature increase is quite simple: There is too little CO2 in the air. At the MLO in Hawaii, the current concentration of CO2 in dry air is 422 ppmv. One cubic meter of this air has 0.8 g of CO2 and a mass of 1.29 kg at STP. This small amount of CO2 can heat up such a large mass of air by a very small amount if at all. I remined you that the heavy industries and heavy transportation systems will always use enormous amounts of fossil fuels. It is now winter in the Northern Hemisphere and huge amounts of fossil fuels will be used for space heating. NB: The graphic was obtained from the late Joh Daly’s website: “Still Waiting For Greenhouse” available at: http://www.John-Daly.com. Totally energy use 2023. Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow “What historians will definitely wonder about in future centuries is how deeply flawed logic, obscured by shrewd and unrelenting propaganda, actually enabled a coalition of powerful special interests to convince nearly everyone in the world that CO2 from human industry was a dangerous, planet-destroying toxin. It will be remembered as the greatest mass delusion in the history of the world – that CO2, the life of plants, was considered for a time to be a deadly poison.” Richard Lindzen, Emeritus Professor of Meteorology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Climate “Science” | Dr. Richard Lindzen | Jordan B Peterson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LVSrTZDopM If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to find the time to post so many times? If you are so busy lobbying, how do you manage to read all of those thousands of peer reviewed science papers? And, why do you not answer J Boles questions? Beetroot relies absolutely and completely on the many things that use fossil fuels. He could never exist without them. Even beetroots need CO2 to grow.. Don’t be too hard on the poor baby, bnice! He’s so delusional that he actually believes that a trace gas has more control over our climate than oceanic cycles and currents, or the Sun! Think how embarrassing it is going to be for him when the adults in his life finally have to explain reality to him! Some are made to be fools! No, Mr. Beeton, you are wrong. There is absolutely no need to bankrupt economies in fear of global warming. A warmer Earth would be an entirely beneficial thing. Historically, the Earth has been warmer than today for 99% of the last 240,000,000 years. We are currently in a Great Ice Age. The coldest point in geologic history was a mere 20,000 years ago, a blip in geologic time. Feigned ignorance of these facts is deliberate abuse of science. No preceding period or epoch with a warmer climate was detrimental to life. On the contrary, life was abundant in past warmth, more abundant, widespread, bio-diverse, and productive than today. All human endeavors also benefit from warmth, including agriculture. The warmest climes are the best for farming, ranching, forestry, and horticulture. That’s a known fact. And CO2 increases yields of all the above. Production of food, clothing, and shelter increase with increasing warmth. The basic needs for human survival correlate. AI, on the other hand, is not needed at all, provides no survival necessity, is a toy, a useless indulgence, and is in fact a hazard to human survival and the well-being of all life. Nope. The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good. But if not done, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen. Governments are moving ahead, including in the US. You may not like it, but the energy transition is underway “…, the harmful costs and effects of global warming will continue to worsen….” where are your “costs” and “bad effects” Put up or SHUT UP ! Read and be educated: https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/effects/ “Scientists predict ” you can’t show any of your imaginary effects are happening . But just Beet on . Still only find nebulous propaganda pap.. that is just sad. Nothing on that page has a single bit of scientific credibility whatsoever. U.S. Sea Level Likely to Rise 1 to 6.6 Feet by 2100 Currently around 2-3mm/year, the 6.6ft value is pure fantasy.

Solar 2.5%, wind 3.5% fossil fuels 81.5 % There is no “transition”. COAL consumption continues to grow GAS consumption continues to grow OIL consumption continues to grow. You are DELUDED and brain-hosed, until all that is left in your skull is a sickly green ooze. President Donald Trump will put an end to this energy transition nonsense by ending the billion dollars of subsidies for wind an solar. Legislation is required to change US energy policy. At the moment, the Republican margin in the House is razor thin, and they are so fractured, they can’t get anything done. in two years, the other party will likely be back in power in the House and the energy transition will continue . You think Trump can’t find away around the green mess that stops progress. Great to see you so against democracy….. you must be a marxist or a moron. ! And you are even more deluded than I thought. ! Only transition in the USA has been from coal to GAS. DRILL BABY DRILL. Trump flipped 4 Senate seats at the last election. He could easily flip a few more in two years time. Probably had 3 more if the marxo-democrats didn’t count “ballots” for week on end. A number of Democrats in Congress have defected from the pack. It will not take but a few more getting back to sensible legislation to make your speculation prove false. “Governments are moving ahead, including in the US.” Drill Baby DRILL !! cheaper cleaner energy Liar. “The wind and sun are free!” — Nitpick Nick Stokes Over their short life time from mining to disposal, wind and solar are one of the most polluting forms of electricity there is. The amount of mining and highly toxic chemicals used in their production is horrendous. They then decimate whole environments, farmland and avian critters in their installation and use. Then at end of their short life have to be disposed of in dump sites, leave huge lumps of concrete in the ground And they are not clean! Oh dear still falling for that furphy. So MAL-EDUCATED and gullible. SOLAR DOES NOT WORK AT NIGHT Are you so dumb that you don’t realise that? It is almost totally absent at peak electricity usage. All it is is a parasitic supply available only when the sun shines. Everywhere that wind and solar infect the grid.. …. electricity prices SKYROCKET. ! And you STILL haven’t answered the question… 1… Please provide empirical scientific evidence of warming by atmospheric CO2. OK, shillboi, see if you can answer this: What material is vital for the production of steel, glass, silicon, etc. from raw ores? And the IEA is a much bigger liar than you. N.B. shillboi ran away from answering. The answer is coal and petroleum. Energy is vital for their production. Did you sleep through the science class that explained the different forms of energy? Are you claiming it is possible to manufacture steel with wind turbines? Fool. As usual, Karlomonte seems to be the fool: “Yes, steel can be made with electricity: You quote the International Energy Agency? Try finding a credible source. You are deep into your Denial Silo — denial of peer reviewed science, now denial of reliable sources, and embrace of junk science. Another moronic comment from the beetroot. Your insults further erode what minimal credibility you once had. Read that. First it is IEA, which is a propaganda arm of the UN. Second, their analysis is terribly flawed. Third, LCOE has many unqualified assumptions, one of which is how long an energy producing system functions at 100% and excludes MTBF. https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Solar-Is-Cheapest-Energy-Source-Says-IEA.html It is also BY FAR the most polluting of all electricity supply options. It’s truly one of the most filthy industrial processes ever invented. The mining, acid leaching, high tonnage coal use for heat treatment and smelting with associated fumes and silicosis disease from dusts and much more makes solar manufacturing one of the filthiest processes ever. It costs 3x more to recycle than landfill, so recycling is nearly non-existent. The toxic heavy metals leach out over time. The first step in cleaning silica to produce metallurgical grade silicon is to rinse it with a mixture of one part acid to one part water This process is called acid leaching and is used to remove impurities such as iron, aluminium, and calcium from the silica. The purified silica is then heated with carbon in the form of coal or charcoal in an electrode arc furnace at a temperature of 1500-2000°C to produce metallurgical grade silicon that is 98% pure.. Some of the solvents used are hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid possibly in combination with each other as a solvent for purification of MG-Si. You are POLLUTION WORSHIPPER….. disgusting !! You are absolutely correct, silicon wafer production is not an easy task. Bullshit, from a bullshitter. So now you are quoting a source that quotes IEA. Peer reviewed? Not. In fact, you did not even read it. LOL. I read it. It is contrary to your stubborn position. Some key points in that oilprice article: “Substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “But what the LCOE formula does not account for is the fact that wind and solar do not generate electricity around the clock. That’s one major cost that is getting overlooked.” “Another substantial cost related to renewables that gets overlooked on a regular basis is the need for storage capacity to offset the intermittency problem.” “First, there is no such storage capacity available that could solve the problem in its entirety, and this already means solar is not as cheap as suggested by its LCOE. Second, available storage technology is rather expensive, piling on more additional costs, also overlooked by the LCOE formula.” BOTTOM LINE: “The reason that the IEA has reached that conclusion is a simple one: cost assumptions. It is based on cost assumptions for solar power generation costs versus fossil fuel costs by the International Energy Agency, an enthusiastic cheerleader for a complete energy transition to a wind, solar, and hydrogen dominated grid, who has concluded that solar is the cheapest form of energy available.” “The transition to cheaper cleaner energy is all good“ Which is why electricity prices SKYROCKET everywhere the infection of wind and solar gets too big. 😉 New AI in the USA will mean a HUGE increase in GAS, and nuclear… … and coal is also likely to make a big resurgence. Wind and solar are totally useless for this purpose. It is neither cheaper nor is it cleaner. So Beeton is gaslighting? Who could have ever guessed? That is a categorically false statement. You are ignoring reality. Its is totally TRUE. You are just too dumb to realise you are doing it. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science paper that refutes my statement. I double dog dare you! Cheaper? Cleaner? Not when one includes the lifecycle costs and the total cost of ownership, which includes disposal of use, non-recyclable materials. From the electronic bible… The iron shall lie down with the lamp Climate change is not a problem, they have a crisis of faith Running an industrial society on wind and solar will require science fiction level storage, something with the performance of Robert Heinlein’s Shipstones. A major plot element in “Friday” was that the trade secret was so valuable the various factions of the Shipstone Trust run that fictional society. A note to various investment companies:it is fiction. Thanks for the Heinlein reference. I was not aware of that when I mentioned that AI would require dependable energy “in science-fiction-like quantities.” “These two former economic powerhouses currently receive over 40% of their electricity from renewables.” Really? I kinda doubt it- other than some rare moments. I don’t know- somebody here can nail it down. It is actually about correct. Go to https://ourworldindata.org/energy Scroll down to the selection boxes about half way down, and click “Electricity Mix” Find the graph which has a tab saying “edit countries and regions”, deselect ‘World’ and select the country you want to look at. You should get a chart where you can read of the values for each type of electricity supply, and be able to do some quick calculation. Bear in mind though… both the UK and Germany are teetering on the edge of collapse energy-wise and are destroying all their manufacturing base because of very high electricity prices. They are on their way to third world status. Anglo-Saxons are practically there … Practically, but.., ‘Strained’ Keir Starmer badly needs holiday, his friends say as they reveal PM is suffering from the ‘relentless strain’ of the job https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14217547/Strained-Keir-Starmer-badly-needs-holiday.html Snowflake PM For the UK, number is actually 43% https://www.cladcodecking.co.uk/blog/post/renewable-energy-percentage-uk and for Germany 52% https://www.cleanenergywire.org/news/renewables-cover-more-half-germanys-electricity-demand-first-time-year#:~:text=Clean%20Energy%20Wire,-, according to these two sources. Even if these numbers are too high, the wind and solar contribution is large enough to have put both countries in jeopardy from Dunkelflaute in November and again in the past 10 days, after I wrote the piece. There is a very simple solution to our energy conundrum, we know big tech, AI and related industries need outrageous amounts of power. If we want a reliable and plentiful source of energy we put them last in line for the power. In other words if there is a danger of a brown out or black out they are the first to have to cut back. The health and wellbeing of the citizen comes before anything else. If we demanded this new fossil fuel and nuclear generators would start popping up everywhere and the big tech/AI guys would be standing in line to help finance them. As for the government and outfits like Blackrock they can go to hell. We don’t much care what they think. Also, maybe, those with the larger demand should pay more per unit because they’re putting a strain on the system. Yes, they should pay more. In Virginia, the legislature is considering changing the cost allocation formula to put more of the burden on data centers instead of spreading the costs across all rate payers. Is that the Virginia that plans to import lots of coal, gas and nuclear powered electricity from out of state ?? Virginia is basically surrounded by Republican states. I hope they say.. “If you want the data centre, the you provide the electricity for it.” That will force Virginia to build new COAL, GAS or NUCLEAR power stations. That would be fun to watch 🙂 Or, require the data centers to build their own power plant. If the data centers pay more for energy, then data center users pay more. Those users then pass their higher costs on and on and on. Either way, the common folk foot the bill. This is econ 101. Joseph, I don’t want them treated different in any way so long as they see to it that new fossil fuel and nuclear generators are built. I would hope that since they are so dependent on reliable and available energy that they would build plenty for all of us. Germany and UK are moving steadily toward economic oblivion. BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen are all facing losses with massive slump in profitability. It is not possible to combine 2,500kg of exotic materials in a way that makes any motor vehicle suitable for the masses. They are creating engineering monstrosities unfit for purpose. A motor vehicle weighing 2,500kg capable of carry 4 people and luggage – say 500kg payload. The Ford Model T weighed 750kg and could transport 750kg if needed. It was a useful vehicle. . Great for woke virtue-seeking though !! “AMD’s new series scales from eight cores up to the $14,813 192-core / 384-thread EPYC 9965, a 500W behemoth that leverages TSMC’s 3nm node for the ultimate in compute density with dense Zen 5c cores.” A building full of these for a super-computer will require several nuclear generators Quick…. build the solar farm to drive it. 😉 Conventional data centers consume about 300-400 watts per sq ft. AI will increase that number 3x or 4x, or more. And that will require solid reliable electricity supply Are you ADVOCATING GAS or Nuclear ? Even a nil-educated monkey like you must know that wind and solar can never provide. He is the co-founder of the Prince William Virginia Chapter of Citizens Climate Lobby and teaches the science of energy and climate change to continuing education students in Northern Virginia. Is this you ? That’s a collection of uneducated brain-washed students in the making !! No hope for their future , thanks to this low level indoctrination. Really sad. The IEA estimates that data centres total electricity consumption could reach the equivalent of the electricity consumption of Japan by 2026. IEA ‘Electricity 2024 Analysis and forecast to 2026’ (Jan 2024) Ok. Cite with a link the peer reviewed science report that backs up your claim. And it is also high time that investors let them know that they will no longer entrust their capital to those who refuse to see that AI lions cannot live on peekaboo sunshine and the whimsy of the wind. Or, investors should recognize that an AI stock market bubble is growing and will eventually burst. I want to put my money into self-driving cars! Then sell them to gullible Democrats and AGW-cultists. 🙂 What could possibly go wrong !! 😉 The future of AI investments was outside the scope of my piece. See this Goldman Sachs report, in particular the comments by Acemoglu and Covello https://www.goldmansachs.com/images/migrated/insights/pages/gs-research/gen-ai–too-much-spend%2C-too-little-benefit-/TOM_AI%202.0_ForRedaction.pdf?ref=wheresyoured.at?ref=wheresyoured.at Half of what most people think about AI is true and the other half not. The true part is that it is artificial. As for renewable, green, net zero, climate protecting, sustainable, energy systems, the only true part is that they are tenuously connected somehow to the idea of energy.

Title: Elon Musk could soon be as rich as the Netherlands
URL: https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/2024/12/22/elon-musk-could-soon-be-as-rich-as-the-netherlands/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T12:24:06Z
Full Content:
In 2027 or soon after we’ll have a new type of fat cat on the planet: the trillionaire (in dollar terms at least). We’ve had billionaires for over a century. US oil tycoon John D Rockefeller was the first to reach that milestone in 1916. According to wealth tracking group Informa Connect Academy (ICA), several current industry titans will achieve trillionaire status before the end of this decade. Elon Musk leads the race but it depends on whose share price performs best over the intervening period. As the head of the electric carmaker Tesla, private rocket company SpaceX and social media platform X (formerly Twitter), Musk is currently the world’s richest man with a current net worth on paper of roughly $450 billion (€431.5bn), according to the Bloomberg Billionaires index. His wealth is estimated to have jumped by more than $170 billion since the US election and his alliance with president-elect Donald Trump, largely on the back of Tesla’s share price. Since the November 5th election Tesla’s stock has surged 70 per cent. On the basis of his current trajectory the ICA predicts he will hit the trillion mark in 2027. But Telsa’s share price has been volatile and Musk appears to be driving X into the ground so things may change. India’s business mogul Gautam Adani is predicted to hit the trillion mark in 2028 followed by Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the AI giant Nvidia, and Prajogo Pangestu, the Indonesian energy and mining mogul, provided their current financial trajectories hold. $1 trillion is a hard quantum to hold in your head. Put it this way it would comfortably buy every home in Ireland. It was only six years ago that companies reached the trillion dollar milestone in terms of valuations (Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion mark in August 2018) and we marvelled, or thought absurd, that a single company could be financially bigger than a developed economy. There are currently nine companies with trillion dollar valuations: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Meta, Berkshire Hathway and Taiwanese semiconductor giant TSMC. Now we’re about to confront the notion that an individual could be as valuable as a developed nation and the millions of workers and their labour that comprise it. The Netherlands, one of Europe’s richest countries, has an annual GDP (gross domestic product) of roughly $1 trillion (€960bn). So if the ICA is right Musk will be richer than the Netherlands is now by 2027. What this acceleration in individual wealth says about the state of the world or modern capitalism is disturbing. On one level it suggests that the current period of rapid technological transformation has outgunned the antitrust legislation designed to police it, creating behemoth monopolies and uber elites wielding too much economic power. According to UK economist Duncan Weldon, the wealth of these aspiring trillionaires is also tied into three more conventional but no less consequential economic trends: decades of low interest rates (which have boosted asset values); accelerated corporate profits; and a shift towards less progressive tax systems. Combined these trends have accelerated global inequality. And this appears to be feeding into a breakdown in consensus politics, a throwback to the Rockefeller days when democracy in many countries fractured. According to Oxfam, this inequality trend has been supercharged by the pandemic. In a report earlier this year the charity noted that almost five billion people had been made poorer by the pandemic while the wealth of the five richest people had more than doubled, from $405 billion in 2020 to $869 billion in late 2023. That’s an increase of $14 million an hour. Oxfam says the world’s richest 1 per cent now own 43 per cent of all global financial assets and emit as much carbon pollution as the poorest two-thirds of humanity. Let’s not be naive, market capitalism depends on inequality and is, in part, driven by it (some people will work harder or take financial risks to get ahead), but when the gap between top and bottom gets too large, when a critical mass of citizens feel the system is rigged against them, we tend to get radical politics. That was surely the lesson of the 20th century. In the 1960s the gap was modest by today’s standards. Expressed as the ratio of the boss’s salary to those on the factory floor, it was just 15-to-1 in the US. According to the Washington-based Economic Policy Institute it is now 221-to-1. Other estimates suggest it is higher. Of course salary is just one metric. In Ireland and other countries an intergenerational divide on housing has become a major and ongoing source of grievance. Musk said once that he believed the effects of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) on employment would soon make it necessary for countries to provide citizens with a basic income as a guardrail against inequality. This was before he bought his way into the second Trump presidency (spending a reported $250 million on the campaign) and supercharged his wealth in the process.

Title: Weekend reading: Merry Christmas everyone
URL: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-merry-christmas-everyone/
Time Published: 2024-12-21T12:57:19Z
Full Content:
What caught my eye this week. I can’t deny the Monevator Christmas party is always a little awkward, but I look forward to it every year. It’s the anonymity that makes it tricky. Not just keeping our identities secret from the waiting staff, but also from each other. Finumus doesn’t want anybody to know who he really is, you see. But when you land your private helicopter in the pub garden it’s a bit of a giveaway. Meanwhile my false beard always gets covered in gravy. Secret Santa adds to the surreal air, but again it’s easy to guess who gave what. Did I really need The Accumulator’s slightly musky Chillbreaker now the cost-of-living crisis is over? And while Squirrel accepted her framed stock certificate of a triple-levered uranium ETF – blatantly from Finumus – with good grace, TA groaned as he unwrapped a copy of One Up On Wall Street. “Every bloody year…” he complained, warding off Peter Lynch’s stock-picking classic with a copy of Tim Hale’s Smart Money – which he carries with him everywhere to shun temptation, like a Holy cross. Lynch’s book flew back through the air at me – it’s not easy to duck when you’re sporting a three-foot long beard – and I packed it away for next year. (Stay hungry, stay frugal!) Then there are the gatecrashers. It’s nice enough when Lars shows his face for old time’s sake. And it’s heartening to see The Greybeard grown fat on his equity income trust dividends after all these years. But is that not Ermine in the corner? Plotting something with a bright-looking fellow on a dusty old Sinclair computer? When the whole of yesteryear’s Team Monevator turns up expecting brandy and mince pies, I’m afraid to say we sneak out the back door and escape via that waiting chopper. Monevator membership revenues are going quite well, but we’re not running another Studio 54 here! Talking of membership, a huge thanks to the many readers who now support this site with a few quid every month. It’s made a big difference. I was reading Ed Zitron this week on how the Internet, media, and just using a computer has been progressively ruined over the past decade, and I thought again that I’d probably have turned off Monevator if enough people hadn’t signed up to support our work. Zitron writes: As every single platform we use is desperate to juice growth from every user, everything we interact with is hyper-monetized through plugins, advertising, microtransactions and other things that constantly gnaw at the user experience. We load websites expecting them to be broken, especially on mobile, because every single website has to have 15+ different ad trackers, video ads that cover large chunks of the screen, all while demanding our email or for us to let them send us notifications. I know – of course we do some of this ourselves. We show ads to non-members on the website, and I prompt new visitors to sign-up to read us by email. We (sparingly) use affiliate links. And some of this involves the same tracking stuff we’re all exposed to on every other site on the Internet, apart from possibly Wikipedia. I suppose a few people may consider us adding a membership tier to be part of this ‘making everything worse’. Well I don’t. I love the membership tier and the purity of email. Some dwindling number of diehards will never accept that creating digital products and destinations for years on end has to be paid for somehow. But for the rest of us I prefer a model where we directly pay for things. I do it myself with other websites and newsletters. Though I accept the costs add up, and there is a limit. If you are of the grumpier persuasion, you’d probably be surprised at everything I turn down. Paid-for links to crypto, currency exchange, and loan sites. (We never sell links). Well-known companies asking us to create stealthy articles to promote their products. Lucrative guest posts by SEO firms. The long trails of clickbait ads that even old-line newspaper sites have at the end of every article these days. Again, you might say you’re looking at an advert next to these words on our website right now. All I can say is that this is the thin end of a very thick wedge. And I fight to stay at the right end. Zitron’s article turned a bit hyperbolic but I agree with most of it. However where I disagree is his broad brush claim that media sites have done all this ‘enshittification’ for vast growth and profits. In fact they’ve usually made endless compromises and degraded the experience to near-unusable levels either because they are desperate not to go bust or because they already went bust and the new owner is squeezing out whatever juice is left in the brand. The big platforms have sucked all the air and money out of the Internet, and everyone else is left to starve. We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing. But countless others have gone dark, or else it would have been better had they done so. As for independent blogs, maybe 95% of those I’ve linked to in the UK are no longer around. Honestly, I’m sometimes tempted to turn Monevator into a subscription-only newsletter and switch off the lights, too. It’s a better experience for readers and better for us. No more fighting spam each day! But we still get so many emails from new people thanking us for helping them take their first steps in investing, or from older hands for keeping them on the straight and narrow. I’ve collected several hundred of these. That folder is probably the crowning achievement of my working life. Perhaps I should have tried harder to achieve more, I guess, but anyway I’m loathe to turn off the site while we’re making a difference – however much Google is trying to kill us and others off with its endless algorithm changes. So again, if you’re signed up as a Monevator member then thank you! You make it possible for us to continue to keep 99% of the 2,000-plus articles we’ve written free to read. A portion of your subscription covers the 30 minutes or more I spend every day keeping Monevator clear of toxic links, racist and sexist comments, and bit rot. Hopefully you’re enjoying the extra member content too, of course! We’re able to go deeper in the member-only articles, especially with my active ones. And it’s very nice not to worry about search engines with them. Don’t forget you can browse all our Mavens and Moguls posts in their archives. There’s quite a few now! On the opposite tack, a few members have asked me to paywall more content. Really – I was surprised too, but I guess it reflects a desire not to be taken advantage of. Personally I feel we have the right balance with our investing-related content, but there is a chance that I will eventually make the Weekend Reading links a members-only affair. Doing these links is a service to our regular readers. Nobody stumbles across them via search. And Weekend Reading is the reading list I’d love to see each week if I wasn’t creating it myself. It takes eight to ten hours to compile each one (much of which consists of reading and rejecting articles you never see links to) but it is a labour of love. However its roots lie in that better Internet of 20 years ago. Back then we used to do ‘blog carnivals’ where blogs would link to each other to spread their traffic and credibility around. Yet besides one or two honourable exceptions – thank you Simple Living in Somerset and Abnormal Returns – almost nobody links freely now. I’ve included hundreds of links to certain blogs and had at most a couple back to us over two decades. More often zero. I get it’s harder because we’re a British site and we can be kind of nerdy. But we do have some articles that are universally worthy of linking to. Even worse, Google probably penalises us nowadays for doing what used to be the right thing and highlighting the best of the web via these links. It’s so rare to do this now that it’s potentially become an indicator of a spammy link farm. Ho hum. A halfway house would be to keep the Weekend Reading list free but for email subscribers only. So again, subscribe to the free emails if you haven’t. Finally, if you’re a member but you’re not getting the emails you expect to see, then please do drop me a line via a reply to this email (ideally) or via the contact form link top-right (risk of getting stuck in spam.) The system is not perfect, but I can always sort out problems. Ditto if you have log-in issues. (Deleting your cookies usually does the trick). Okay, that’s a lot in the weeds for a busy Christmas weekend. I try not to solicit membership too often but the reality is some people churn away (et tu Maven?) so we have to keep topping up. TLDR: please everyone sign-up as members and then we can stay classy indefinitely. Beyond that, thanks for reading us for another year. With all the competition from cat and dog TikToks and belaboured YouTube videos where someone reads out their Vanguard statement for 20 minutes for 100,000 views, we do not take our audience for granted. Nor, for that matter, the many wonderful readers who add so much value in our comments. If Monevator still has a USP in today’s universally indexing-friendly age, it’s surely in the quality of the discussions that take place beneath so many of our articles. Right, that’s us almost done for 2024. I’ll have my Moguls missive out for December but otherwise we’re taking a break until the first Saturday of the new year.

Look forward to your posting a (ID redacted) selfie from the festive works outing! ;o) Thank you for all your content in 2024 (and previous years). I would not complain if all your content was behind a paywall, however, I know you help people at the start of their investing life and may not have access to your content otherwise. Season’s Greetings, Lee. Thanks again for all your work, time and musings, and the rest of the team. 2024 has been a bit of a naff one on a personal level, but the learnings and information gained via this site have meant the financial impacts of some poor health have been cushioned. Roll on 2025. Wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year year. Thanks for inviting me to the party, TI! (I didn’t realise until I bit into one that the gold coins weren’t chocolate… But the crackers with stock tips instead of jokes were a nice touch.) Happy Christmas to all – and wishing the site a successful year to come! Yeah, back at you big fella. Thanks to all for all your efforts. See you next year, DV. Happy Christmas and thanks for all you do! Thanks for another great year of education and discussions. Much appreciated and hopefully long may it continue. Thank you for your excellent job. Your help was greatly appreciated during my long years of toil in the NHS to facilitate my escape act and live a life of modest luxury in the Med. Merry Christmas and looking forward to more excellent articles and links in 2025. I must say that the comments are also some of the best I have seen in any website. You have created a great community of experts around this site. Peace and goodwill to the Monevator Massive! Love monevator..long may it continue. Obs thanks for the great articles but I would also like to express my gratitude to the mostly unsung heros that are the comments posters. There are too many great ones to list but many times I’ve read a post that I would like to thank but don’t want to clog up the discussion. Here’s a nod to you all. Thanks, have a good one! And keep them coming Merry Christmas to you and all the contributors to Monevator, including the commentees. I came across this website comment via the dreaded X and thought it might be of interest to you (if this comment doesn’t end up in spam) https://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/proxyactivism.html But I thought it kind of describes what your members are doing by our small fee – keeping something we feel is worthwhile going and maybe changing the world for some in a small way. The Monevator community feels special, and I’m happy to form part of it. You made the right pricing choices by creating the lower entry Mavens subscription. If it was for the premium Moguls only I’d never have converted, and would feel bad for not supporting the site. Agree that comments add value to already superb content. After years of reading nowadays perhaps 2/3 of even the nerdier comments make sense to me! Happy holidays! Please keep running this site. It is such a useful resource. I know from personal experience how difficult it is – and have given up myself in my niche interest presence some time ago. Thank you for all the good work! Have a great festive time. Thanks for all the effort and articles to TI and TA. I really think you need better pseudonyms – Batman & Robin, Butch & Sundance or Delboy and Rodney possibly. Also echo the thanks to the other posters who take the time to write thoughtful, constructive and helpful posts in the main. One comment on this week’s links – the Chase 5% offer should read as “including” rather than “plus” as it is 3.5+1.5 for 6 months. I raise a glass to y’all. I really enjoyed Ed’s never forgive them link – I was recently and fairly charged as a mobile refusenik but I ain’t got nothing on Ed. It sounds like I iced my Facebook account in the nick of time earlier this year. To the old ways of intelligent human discourse rather than AI slop 😉 Another hearty thank you from me too. After *counts on fingers* about seven years of religiously logging onto your site a couple of times a week and reading almost every article (I draw the line at the nerdiest posts about bond drawdown strategies…), you’ve just persuaded me to sign up via email. I feel a bit ashamed not even being a Maven, but – and I probably shouldn’t admit this – if you put Weekend Reading behind a paywall, that would probably push me to become a paying member. Thank you, and Merry Christmas. I love coming here. Another big thank you for all the great articles (which must involve a significant amount of research and time I’m sure) and weekend reading items over the year. The comments are great to read too. All make the membership subscription extremely worthwhile. [Existential mini special, re the Garden of Forking Paths, see also comments + links at #41, 42, 44 & 45-48 (Aug 23) on DA here: https://monevator.com/weekend-reading-not-a-prayer-for-serenity/ Thank you for all your efforts this year. I too love this site and look forward to my Saturday reading. I subscribe to Pensioncraft and the FT and I would give them up before Monevator! Merry Xmas and best wishes for a successful 2025 I am sure you believe it, as having followed this site since the beginning i have never thought you into trolling, but the statement “We’re spoiled in the UK. We have the BBC and (whatever you think of the politics) The Guardian, two of the least-polluted free media sites left standing.” Is quite incredible, amid even a cursory look at how both responded to the October mass murder and rape of Jewish children and elders. Both weee found to deliberately pivoting against Jewish people. Many, many other examples exist. The Times is but one that is head and shoulders of both. Enjoy the financial info as ever, and have a great Xmas Is anyone going to mention how lucrative 2024 has been? It’s been an annus miraculus. I guess if we do that we’re guaranteed to come a cropper in 2025 Gary, The Times site isn’t free. Might be much better, but it isn’t free. Marry Christmas to TI and TA, long as this site exist. Thank you TI & TA, other contributors and regular commenters. I have only commented a couple of times before, and never in a substantive way to actual financial discussions (I have no particular financial expertise or unique experience to share). However, I am here several times a week and religiously read all the articles and comments, gaining much in the way of entertainment and education on the way. So, I do want to momentarily step out of the shadows to say “Cheers” to you all at the end of another informative, enlightening and thought provoking year. I have followed this site for many years: there is so much great, informative content, you should be proud of what you have achieved. Merry Christmas As Roberto #8 but colder and wetter in Wales.Thankyou. For this tired dad, you are the Sunday Supplement of personal finance email round-ups. I look forward to and devour the content in the same way I used to for old media. Thank you and merry Christmas Thanks for all the effort and time it takes to produce the excellent articles and resources. Merry Xmas all I understand the sentiment of not being taken advantage of but for me supporting a site that I regularly direct people to when teaching them about investing is a way of paying it forward ( i really must look into whether i could leave the day job and do financial coaching full time as its definitely the ‘find something you love enough to do for free and youll never work again’ ). The fact I feel I can afford to is in no small part down to the knowledge gained on this website. Take advantage all you want Thanks @TI and @TA for all your efforts this last year … and a big thanks to folks like @ermine and @AlCam for all their follow-up musings too. Whilst financially it’s been a good year, in all honesty I cannot wait for 2024 to be over. This site has kept me distracted from my cancer treatment (fingers crossed all sorted, now in remission) and it has been a mine of fantastic content and (mostly) great banter. Due to the work of @TA I think I’ll be cooking up a gilt-ladder or two next year – would never have approached doing this before, so thank you very much. Here’s to 2025 … bring it on ! @Rhino #22 > It’s been an annus miraculus. I confess I have made the assumption that this is simply the high recent levels of inflation rattling out, shortening the ruler against which we measure our networth. It was one of the useful points made in Rob Dix’s money book that your market holdings are a store of value outwith government manipulation of the money supply. But hey, not to look a gift horse in the mouth, wherever the uplift came from it’s better than not having it at all. Merry Christmas, and happy winter solstice all! I’m a non subscriber. I love the site. I love Weekend Reading especially. The site feels like one of the few non toxic corners left on the internet. I’m not one of the typical readers though, I don’t think. Not high earner, not high net worth. Every month finances are very tight. Monevator has changed my life for the better, from piles of debt in 2014, to small regular investments these days (I’d probably be homeless without the site given recent health issues, if I’d not changed finances). I’d hate to lose access – certainly to the articles that help people like me most, but also understand that producing such quality should be rewarded. Hopefully in the future I will be able to start to repay what this site has given me, but for now thank you is all I can offer. @ermine – well 2024 was the year I did some ‘inflation adjusted’ calculations (with a helping hand from Al Cam the inflation guru). Let’s just say I wish I hadn’t. . I quickly recoiled and took the blue pill of nominal returns. Think I’ll stay there for mental well being reasons. 2024 also the year I attended a FIRE meetup for first time which was pretty cool. Matching blogs to real people is fascinating after all this time. I think you once met up with liberate dot life, a long since moth balled blog, in the real world. Which made me think an ermine hike to see some historic stones could be a grand day out! @Team M: Seasons Greeting to all at Monevator Towers. Great year in ’24! Long may it continue. P.S. I trust you have all now got over the office Christmas party? @Rhino: No guru – just wanted to understand inflation better and had the time and inclination to do so once I pulled the plug. Re: red pill (vs blue pill), see last para (that begins “Fearing …”) at: https://monevator.com/vanguard-price-rise/#comment-1852375 Merry Christmas / holiday of choice. TI (and TA) thanks for all you do. The subscription is a thanks rather than a particular interest in the extra articles. Without the free content I would never have been able to read so many of your great informative articles and not gone on to subscribe. As you say, it’s a balance and I for one think you do an amazing job at maintaining that balance. @all — Thanks to everyone for such smashing feedback, very generous and great to hear that we’re still mostly hitting the right spot. 🙂 @carl — Understood, and thanks for reading us. We definitely appreciate some people at the start of the journey are watching all the pennies — in fact we support that if things are tight! 🙂 One way we’ve tried to tilt towards this reality is to make the Maven member articles a bit more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared more for those at the other end of the journey, where there’s a bit more cash to spare but also a need for insights into the trickier and arguably less well-covered end of lifecycle… @The Investor First of all, thank you for all the amazingly helpful articles over the years and I wish you and everyone at Monevator a lovely Christmas and New Year! I think the general idea of making Maven member articles more de-accumulation focused, so hopefully geared for those with more cash to spare, is a pretty smart idea. It would be nice, however for the occassional free article on this area, even if it is primarily only a collection of free resources for less wealthy retirees. Happy 2025! Thank you to all the Monevator team! Another year of tremendously insightful articles and well worth the subscription. Happy Christmas. Ditto, all the supportive comments. It has been 5 years since feeling comfortable with our level of FI and finally pulling the plug on work. After many years of benefiting from all the fabulous articles and associated comments, I have finally and belatedly signed up as a Maven. £30 pa is a small price to pay for this great resource. Not sure I am yet a Mogul! Long may Monevator continue. Thanks to all at the Moneyvator team for the work you do and best wishes. @Rhino #33 Well I’m all for stoney things 😉 I went a blog meetup 12 years ago. In tribute to our host’s ‘I’m Still Standing’ riff I note that very few of those blogs are still standing. Ed Zitron’s article seems pertinent – it was the platforms wot ate all the good things. Plus people have lost the ability to read – it’s all youtube videos and podcasts. Panem et circenses because, y’know, focus is hard. I am still not a digital native, though I accept the STFU old man vibe from the last post. In return for eschewing the hive-mind I have time to think and to look, Thoreau’s a man is rich in what he can afford to leave alone is me. There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me. And absolutely nobody else. Not quite Nagel’s What is it like to be a Bat but further along that line than is useful. The demon inflation makes it hard to see right. I do think anyone looking at a great 2024 does need to ask the question how much of this is real particularly if a lot of your capital was bought a while ago – pre Covid say. They still need to kiss the ground and thank their lucky stars, because although the numbers are wrong the value is largely preserved. But we do need to think of those starting out too. Hopefully they will gain from the crash yet to come when we discover AI isn’t all that, or indeed they will gain from the next 15 year bull run is somebody works out how to use it to add value. @TI I am all for keeping Weekend Reading on the open part of the site, and the deacc emphasis on mavens seems an equitable balance. I don’t feel taken advantage of at all, in the round playing some of the hints easily pay for a mogul subs. Sure, there’s some small print saying don’t do that, but I am old enough and ugly enough to go yeah whatever. So far my error was not to go big enough. A Merry Christmas to all Monevatorites, and be of good cheer because the World can’t end today since it’s already tomorrow in Australia 🙂 It is curious how my and @Gary’s (#21) recollections disagree. None of the media I saw expressed anything but stunned horror to the atrocities of 7 October 2023 – and that would have included both the BBC and Guardian because of their open access. In the weeks and months subsequently several commentators expressed their concern that the Israeli response was disproportionate, and that included people writing for the Guardian and also other papers – though there was rather little on the BBC website which includes little other than news (of course the broadcast discussion programmes will have covered all points of view). The Guardian also gave space to writers expressing support for Israel, though none that I saw that gave any credible justification for the death of 14,000 children as part of any legitimate self-defence. But more importantly, absolutely none used anyone’s Jewish faith as a basis for criticism. At least in the mainstream media I see. @Gary @Jonathan B — Thanks both for sharing your views but there are better venues to debate such a contentious topic I’d suggest, so with both sides represented let’s now please leave it there. Thanks! @ermine – ‘There’s little I can contribute to a meet-up, because as I learned then, I am a serious anomaly’ ..and therein lies the value of the contribution. Precisely because, rather than despite the fact, you present a perspective not shared by the majority. Sometimes we need the inconvenient lone voice of alternative rather than the comforting cacophony of the status quo. Happy Christmas & thanks as always, Monevator team. Glad to hear others who enjoyed the Ed Zitron piece (but agree that it did veer a bit into ‘old man shouts at cloud’ at times, so I hope it wasn’t just read by people like us as confirmation bias). This & the OG Doctorow piece are so important, I think, we are sleepwalking into it all, and it’s already pretty hideous. It will remain a slight mystery (I think being UK, rather than US, is definitely some of it, & not being as aggressive monetisers) why Monevator isn’t much bigger than it is, & so it’s a shame to have to say that consequently it’s probably the better for that. I suppose I must ask (unless I missed something) *cough* where’s the book. I know many people who say their careers went into another gear once they had a book published. But I also know that writing a book is really hard! And very different from writing shorter online pieces. (I must be in a minority of one who was unimpressed by Morgan Housel’s first book – I adore his blog essays, but didn’t think he managed to convert it successfull into a book format). Happy Christmas again, & here’s to good things in 2025 (for me, a return to form for LTI is high on my list!). Merry Christmas everyone, have a lovely time! As always, thanks for the links TI. 😀 Happy Christmas everyone. I’m so pleased that I found Monevator a few years ago (I can’t quite remember but think it was through the compound interest calculator). I agree that it does seem like one of the more civilised parts of the Internet and I routinely find the comments very intelligent and thought provoking. Thank you @TA and @TI for providing such a useful and informative resource. I look forward to the weekend reading email each and every week. @Alan — I think you’re right re: the Chase account wording, ‘including’ is a bit clearer. I’ve changed it now. Thanks! @Rhino — TA (mostly) and me (a little bit) finished 95% of a book about ten years ago. But for various reasons we couldn’t/didn’t get it to 100%. Now the original text would need revising and it’s all too daunting for what would probably be a labour of love only, realistically. @all — Thanks for the further nice comments — and for the new sign-ups! 🙂 Don’t want to clog this thread up with my thanks but we’re enjoying and appreciating them all. It’s interesting—I initially visited the site for the articles, but it’s the weekend reading that I find absolutely brilliant. As a financial adviser, I value having access to a diverse range of articles and opinions, and this is a standout. The best £8 I spend every month! All the best to everyone here, both content makers and commentators. This site remains one of the few civilised places left on the internet. I’ve been following for years but don’t comment much, if at all, mainly because I can’t match the expertise on show here but also because I don’t read the articles until a few days have passed. This allows the comments to build up to a reasonable level. And as mentioned already, the comments (mostly) really do add to the enjoyment of the site. Merry Christmas! Thanks for all the hard work that you all do to keep this unique site going without lowering the bar. Please KBO into the new year and beyond. Long live the Monevator! @ermine(#41) – ‘I am a serious anomaly, both in having a work does not equal meaning philosophy which 12 years and some experimentation shows holds for me’. You are in good company. Bertrand Russell agrees with you: https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/ @Nimbus, couldn’t agree more. A great, civilised site with loads of information and brilliant comments that take the debate to another level. Wishing you all a Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025. I’m sure it will be another quiet year…! This particular passage in Russell’s ‘In praise of Idleness’ is unforgettable: ‘When I was a child, shortly after urban working men had acquired the vote, certain public holidays were established by law, to the great indignation of the upper classes. I remember hearing an old Duchess say, “What do the poor want with holidays? they ought to work.” People nowadays are less frank, but the sentiment persists, and is the source of much economic confusion’. Just another voice to add to the Merry Christmas and Thank You chorus. Merry Christmas and thank you for all that you do. I think that Weekend reading is one of the best curations on the Internet. And that the whole Monevator concept represents a hopeful reminder of what the Web can be. Since the subject of Russell has arisen here’s my merry Xmas prezzie to all. It’s a cracker. Ho, ho, ho. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OXtO92x5KA Merry Xmas one and all. May 2025 bring you good fortune. Verdad Persistent Alpha piece reminiscent of FundExpert’s fund momentum approach (as well as macro hedge fund pod shops). CFA Institute series should provoke caution in using the widely circulating comparisons back to 1928 and 1871 for the US markets. That said, UK Dividend Stocks highlight that we’re likely approaching bubble territory regardless of issues with underlying data for metrics. Thanks to the Monevator team and best wishes to all for 2025! And thanks also for the Bertrand Russell links, fascinating stuff. Thanks to all at Team Monevator and all the readers who comment, for entertaining and educating me these past 10 years. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas and a prosperous 2025. Merry Christmas and all the best for 2025, thanks for everything! @TI Sorry to have to “fuel your ire” at this festive time but reality has to be faced viz: https://www.lse.ac.uk/News/Latest-news-from-LSE/2024/l-December-2024/brexit-reduced-goods-exports-by-27bn @Factor — Yes, it’s grim of course but I think the appetite for doing anything about it has probably fallen even further given how the first few months of the Labour administration have gone. They have certainly played their hospital-pass of a hand poorly, but nevertheless they are also getting panned by the electorate / media for more or less coming clean on the real numbers and the state the UK is actually in. The same would be true of anyone trying to ‘fix’ Brexit. Remember a substantial number of nincompoops still think it was an economic boon for Britain, and they’d be reminded of that as soon as any new trade-offs were agreed to try to take the edge off the economic damage. As always, nincompoops = believing the non-existent economic argument for Brexit. (If you voted to reduce immigration or for superior government then fair enough, though I wouldn’t rush to mark that report card either if I were you… 😉 ) Verily ’tis a time for giving – the state pension is normally paid with “religious” regularity on every fourth Friday but I see from my daily balance check that it has actually been paid today! @Factor, So you NI number ends (before the alphabetic last character) 80 to 99, see: https://www.gov.uk/state-pension/when-youre-paid. My DB seems to always be paid early in December too – but did not know that largesse extended to the SP too. Will hopefully find out about this in a few years time. Unfortunately, this approach can make January seem like a long month though. But I should have got accustomed to that by now as my salary was always paid early in December. When I worked overseas I learned that some nations pay their employees double pay in December – ie their salary is effectively divided by 13 and 1/13 is paid Jan to Nov inclusive and 2/13 in December. No idea if this still happens? Then there are those that get paid every 4 weeks – and I guess that must be a bit confusing. Pay day itself is also a curiosity. All my working life I was paid in arrears very much towards the end of the month (although various algorithms applied, e.g. 28th (unless a weekend/holiday), the last Friday, the last working day, etc. I do know of some company’s that pay their staff in the middle of the month – but I never worked for one of them. Having said that, my DB actually pays me in advance, so I receive e.g. Aprils pension (in principle) at the start of April but in reality it is always paid at the end of March. This year I received Januarys DB pension yesterday. Merry Christmas and best wishes to all at Monevator and all its readers!

Title: Top 10 Investment Themes For 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2024/12/20/top-10-investment-themes-for-2025/
Time Published: 2024-12-20T18:23:18Z
Full Content:
Will the bull market continue into 2025? Happy New Year, all. My overall macro theme for 2024 was An Expansion of the Rally. The theme ultimately proved to be accurate, as the dominance of the Magnificent 7 stocks (Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta Platforms) dissipated during the second half of the year as the other “Not So Magnificent 493” stocks (i.e., the remaining stocks of the S&P 500 Index) took over the leadership role. The Magnificent 7 accounted for 62% of the total return of the S&P 500 in 2023, and 59% during the first0 half of 2024, but just 9.2% during the third quarter of 2024. This passing of the baton is important, healthy and constructive for the continuation of the current bull market run, which is now over two years old, with a cumulative return of 74.2% as of November 29, 2024. For perspective on this front, prior to the current bull market, according to data from Yardeni Research and Yahoo! Finance, there have been 12 bull markets since 1946 and the average duration of those bull markets was 5.3 years, with an average cumulative return of 177.5%. Of course, this time could be different, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Stock market leadership was not the only significant transition that took place in 2024. The U.S. election concluded with a transition in the White House and Senate as the Republicans now control all three legs of the federal government stool, given that they also maintained control of the House of Representatives. Time will tell what this transition will mean in terms of policy implementations and their impacts on economic and stock market growth. The Federal Reserve also transitioned from an inflation-fighting, higher interest rate environment to the beginning stages of what will likely be a multi-year rate-cutting campaign. They kicked off the campaign with 100 bp (1%) in rate cuts towards the latter stages of 2024. According to the Fed's final 2024 release of their infamous "Dot Plot" chart in December, they are forecasting another 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2025 and 50 bp (0.50%) in rate cuts in 2026. The Fed is also forecasting inflation, as measured by Core PCE, to decrease to 2.5% in 2025 and then decrease further to 2.2% in 2026. As a result, I see the theme for 2025 as Growth Opportunities Ahead. This theme does not imply that all areas of the market will move higher in the new year because they likely will not. It also does not mean the economy will experience exponential growth because it likely will not. Finally, it does not imply that periods of short-term bouts of volatility will not happen, as they likely will, given current valuations and the many geopolitical and central bank uncertainties that lie ahead. What it does suggest, however, is that the next four years will undoubtedly look very different than the prior four years, and the next decade will look very different than the last decade. Over the shorter term, the outlook for lower interest rates and inflation, coupled with expected economic growth and stability under a Trump Administration (with the support of Congress), provides tailwinds for potential growth opportunities in both equities and fixed income. However, while I see numerous growth opportunities ahead in 2025, investors would be wise to be selective as growth will likely be less than what the stock market experienced in the prior two years and more pronounced in certain areas of the market than others. Some of these areas are highlighted below. 1. Bull Market and Earnings Growth Expansion: For the breadth of the bull market to continue to expand, the breadth of the earnings rally also needs to expand. Fortunately, both of these expansions began during the second half of 2024, and I believe that the momentum will carry forward through 2025. In terms of earnings growth, according to FactSet, the per-share operating earnings growth pace for the overall S&P 500 Index is currently forecasted at 15%. As a result, expanding beyond, but not necessarily abandoning, U.S. large-cap stocks is worthy of consideration for the new year. Expansion candidates would include U.S. mid-cap, U.S. small-cap and international stocks (predominantly international developed market stocks) that pay attractive dividends, have a history of price performance, and are poised for total return potential ahead. 2. The Long Game of Artificial Intelligence Investing: In terms of where we are in the timeline of artificial intelligence (AI), I believe that we are just in batting practice of a double-header with so many more opportunities that lie ahead in the development and application of AI. According to Faist, as of June 11, 2024, the global AI market is expected to reach $1.81 trillion by 2030, with a 36.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR). However, investors and companies need to be patient with their investments in this revolutionary technology, as some may not necessarily see a return on their investment for years to come. As I see it, the AI revolution road is a long one with many potholes that will create many winners and many losers. As a result, as opposed to just trying to find the next Nvidia or hot chips/semiconductor company, investors should consider potential investment opportunities in the entire AI Ecosystem, which is comprised of data centers, software, hardware and chips/semiconductors. Data centers and their associated tremendous need for power and cooling solutions, in particular, have become a critical component of the AI ecosystem. 3. Increased Investment in Defense and Security: U.S. defense and national security needs to focus on replenishment, upgrades and modernization, addressing gaps in naval readiness, advancing missile defense systems highlighted by recent conflicts, and integrating cutting-edge technologies like autonomous systems (i.e. drones) to meet evolving global threats. Fortunately, more spending is on the way as defense spending in the United States is predicted to increase every year over the next decade, totaling approximately $1.1 trillion in 2034–that represents an increase of over 20% vs. 2023 and 263% vs. 2000, according to Statista Research Department as of July 5, 2024. Companies that play a pivotal role in areas such as enhancing military readiness, advancing missile defense systems, and driving technological innovation in autonomous and defense technologies stand to benefit from the increases in investment and spending in these areas. 4. Fed Adopts More Gradual Pace toward Interest Rate Cuts: According to its updated Dot Plot chart (see below), the Fed is currently forecasting 50 bp in additional rate cuts in 2025 and another 50 bp in rate cuts in 2026. All this would follow the 100 bp in rate cuts that the Fed enacted during the latter stages of 2024. These cuts align with their long-run neutral rate expectation of around 3.0%. In terms of the pace of their cuts, I believe that the Fed will adopt a more gradual pace of easing in 2025 and 2026 with no single rate cuts of greater than 25 bp until the Fed Funds Target Rate is closer to their long-run neutral rate expectation of 3% (which may not be achieved by the end of 2026), given the many uncertainties surrounding the labor market, inflation, potential tariffs, and the policies to be implemented by the incoming administration. Regardless of the pace and extent of this rate-cutting campaign, it has become abundantly clear that interest rates will be lower in 2025 and over the next two years. As a result, investing in areas of the market likely to benefit from a declining interest rate environment is worthy of consideration. These areas may include, but are not limited to, certain sectors of equities, such as healthcare, information technology, consumer staples, financials, communication services and consumer discretionary, as well as bonds of different credit qualities, with an overweight towards investment grade. Federal Reserve "Dot Plot" Chart as of December 18, 2024 FOMC Dot Plot Chart December 18, 2024 5. Large Cap Pharma Turns to Small Cap Biotech for Answers: Large-cap pharmaceutical companies face multiple headwinds as they continue to have their profit margins pressured by Washington D.C.'s push to lower drug prices and larger revenue-producing drugs that have come off patent or are scheduled to see come off patent and be challenged by lower generic drug prices. One answer to their revenue quandary can be found in the innovative healthcare solutions being developed by smaller-cap biotech firms. These innovative healthcare solutions, which are now being assisted by artificial intelligence developments in certain cases, include but are not limited to gene therapies, RNA therapeutics, precision and target oncology treatments such as CAR-T cell therapies, and, of course, obesity drug breakthroughs such as GLP-1. In 2024, according to BioPharma Drive, as of November 26, there were 36 Biotech M&A transactions totaling just over $45 billion, the latter well below expectations coming into the year as many of the deals involved smaller companies. However, the average premium paid for the 36 transactions in 2024 was an impressive 83%. Looking ahead to 2025, many analysts are optimistic that the total number and total money amount of biotech-related M&A transactions will increase. To this end, PwC, in its "Pharmaceutical and life sciences: U.S. Deals 2025 outlook," expects transactions between $5 billion and $15 billion to see sustained activity in 2025 while recognizing geopolitical factors that could bring headwinds. Investors thus need to find those smaller-cap biotech companies with existing breakthroughs or innovative drugs in the FDA approval pipeline that large-cap pharmaceutical companies desire to add to their platforms and thus have the greatest chance of being acquired. Small-and mid-cap biotech companies with strong pipelines and focused therapies, such as rare diseases, RNA-based therapies or advanced immunology, according to Biopharma Boardroom, appear to have the most appeal to potential large-cap pharmaceutical acquirers in the current environment. Looking for those companies with related drugs in Phase II or Phase III of the FDA approval process is a good starting point for identifying potential investment opportunities. 6. Munis Poised to Perform: Tax free income is always attractive to income-oriented investors, particularly investors in higher tax brackets. I anticipate this level of attraction being heightened in 2025. Heading into the new year, the balance sheets of many local and state governments are relatively strong, and the positive outlook for employment and the economy in 2025 should bode well for the tax revenues of many municipalities. Additionally, comparable yields of municipal bonds are currently and should remain, very attractive to investors. According to data from Schwab* as of December 3. 2024, the tax-equivalent yield of munis for an investor in the top tax bracket is near its high over the past 15 years. Concerns over the potential repeal of the municipal bond exemption appear now to be overblown, setting the stage for what could be a high level of demand for municipal bonds and municipal bond-oriented strategies in the new year. Lower short-term interest rates should also benefit municipal closed-end fund (CEF) strategies that employ leverage, many of which are still trading at a discount to their net asset values (NAVs). 7. Financials (including Regional Banks) Rebound: Many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis and ensuing hangover have seemingly abated as short-term interest rates have declined (and are forecasted to decline further), the prices of U.S. Treasurys have increased, and the prospects for more economic growth and less regulation have increased following the election of Donald Trump. Less regulation and lower potential capital requirements could also lead to great industry consolidation via an increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). To this end, Piper Sandler analyst Mark Fitzgibbon said in a Banking Dive article that he expects 2025 and 2026 to see robust bank M&A activity and that deal approvals, under a Trump administration, will speed up markedly and the process will be more clearly delineated. Regional banks rebounded during the latter half of 2024. I believe that the rebound will extend, and more potential upside remains for certain regional banks in 2025. 8. Preferreds Benefit from Financials Rebound and Lower Interest Rates: Preferred securities represent ownership in a corporation and have both bond and stock-like features. Preferreds generally pay a fixed income, have a par value, hold a credit rating, and trade on major exchanges. They also typically have a higher stated dividend payout than the corporation's common shares and even bonds. Despite these features, they are often not considered by investors to help meet their respective income and growth needs, and perhaps they should be. Preferreds did suffer a pullback following the regional bank crisis that began back in March 2023 with the seizure of Silicon Valley Bank, given that banks are typically the largest issuer of preferred securities and contagion risk was at the forefront of many investors' mindsets. However, as discussed earlier, many of the factors that led to the regional banking crisis have now dissipated, creating attractive entry points for many preferred securities that have not yet fully recovered from the pullback and potential total return opportunities ahead. 9. Look to Sources of Power to Help Power Your Returns: Data centers are forecasted to use up to 9% of total electricity generated in the United States by the end of the decade, more than doubling their current consumption, according to Reuters as of May 29, 2024. Electricity is stretched in the U.S., and our electricity grid is antiquated and unreliable. As a result, the data centers that serve as the nervous system of the AI ecosystem will need to look beyond traditional energy sources, such as electricity, and alternative sources of energy, such as natural gas and nuclear energy, to help provide the massive amount of power they need. As it relates to natural gas, S&P Global Ratings estimates that U.S. data centers' increasing energy demands will lead to additional gas demand of between 3 billion and 6 billion cubic feet per day by 2030, from a starting point of almost none today. As it relates to nuclear energy, Goldman Sachs believes that we are in the early stages of a nuclear renaissance in the U.S. and globally as it relates to data center power demand in the form of small modular reactors (SMRs) and larger-scale nuclear power plants. Companies that provide products or services in these areas stand to benefit from all of this anticipated demand for power in the new year. 10. Expect More Short-Term Bouts of Volatility but Don't Abandon Stocks: In 2024, as of December 2, there were only 16 days where the S&P 500 Index moved by more than 1.5% in a given trading day–and 7 of those 16 days were positive moves! This amount translates to just 3% of the trading days involving a downside move of 1.5% or more, representing a historically low level of volatility and should not be expected to continue throughout 2025. The S&P 500 also saw 54 record closes in 2024, as of December 2, so valuations are rich, and smaller-scale corrections are possible. These corrections, of course, can be met by money coming off the sidelines to take advantage of more attractive entry points. The potential for more volatility in 2025 does not mean that investors should try to time the market, as timing the market is often an exercise in futility, and "staying on the sidelines" for too long can have a negative impact on achieving longer-term financial goals. Rather, a more balanced approach towards stock market positioning, perhaps through equal-weighted strategies, covered calls, or more defensive stocks, may be worthy of consideration for certain investors and/or portions of their overall portfolios. Best wishes for a productive and successful 2025! * Source: Schwab, Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index, as of 12/3/2024.

Title: Databricks raises a cool $10B as the boom in AI models rages on

Full Content:
UPDATED 13:04 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 THIS WEEK IN ENTERPRISE by Robert Hof The bottomless pit of funding for all things artificial intelligence remains… bottomless. Case in point: This week Databricks raised more money than God. That’s going to be one monster IPO next year (maybe) if the economy holds up. Meanwhile, Perplexity raised $500 million for its AI search and immediately bought AI startup Carbon. And continuing the AI funding bubble boom, Sandbox AQ raised $300 million. But the business is real, as AI is expected to drive enterprise tech upside next year. The bubble boom in AI models is continuing too, as Google, OpenAI, Nvidia, Meta and others all released new models and ways to use and access them. Salesforce also beefed up its just recently introduced AI agent platform Agentforce. But OpenAI faces legal headwinds as Elon Musk and Meta both opposed its plans to create a for-profit company. Neobank Chime filed confidentially for an initial public offering next year, following ServiceTitan’s IPO last week. Is a thawing in the works this winter? Dave Vellante and David Floyer have a plan to revive Intel’s chip foundry business, but it’s going to take a lot of cooperation by some powerful companies and the government. Cyber consolidation keeps chugging along, as Arctic Wolf bought BlackBerry’s Cylance unit and Cisco bought SnapAttack. Elsewhere in technology, TikTok’s bid to survive in the U.S. will go to the Supreme Court next month. Your guess as to what the Supremes will do is as good as mine.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / DECEMBER 20 2024 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – NVIDIA, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners.

Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Dendias and the military camps, the donors and… poor Loukas, the registrar’s anxiety, and the new investor in Athens hotels

Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:32:19Z
Full Content:
Hello there! With the holiday season upon us, it seems the Christmas spirit is spreading, and the idea of goodwill is more prominent than ever. Let me begin with an event that took place yesterday at the Ministry of National Defense. Thanasis Laskaridis and his family laid the foundation for the new building of the Special Cyber Unit of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA), which will be constructed thanks to a donation by the “Athanasios C. Laskaridis Foundation,” named after him. The modest ceremony was attended by Minister Nikos Dendias, Deputy Minister Yiannis Kefalogiannis, the host, GEETHA Chief General Dimitris Choupis, and a select few distinguished guests, including U.S. Ambassador George Tsounis and Chania MP Sevi Voloudaki. Minister Dendias expressed his gratitude for the donation, noting that last year, donations to the Ministry of Defense amounted to €234,000, while this year they soared to €26 million. Interesting, right? But even more striking was the closing remark of the donor, Thanasis Laskaridis, which I’ll quote verbatim: “After all, as the popular song says, dedicated to poor Loukas, we won’t take a single penny to the grave. It’s good, then, for those whom God has blessed with some surplus to do something to help our homeland. It’s time for all of us to get rid of the ‘crabs in our pockets’ and do whatever we can, whatever is necessary.” Dendias’ Commentary and Military Camp Rumors During the same event, Dendias couldn’t avoid questions from those present about the well-known issue (regarding the President of the Republic), jokingly responding, “Well, I’m probably the last person who could comment on this matter,” which, of course, has been settled for a while now—if it was ever truly open. On the other hand, the Minister was much more talkative about efforts to modernize military camps, making sure to throw in a jab about the sparse rumors suggesting that the areas formerly used as camps will be turned into business ventures. “When someone wants to slander another person or initiative, they immediately turn it into a story about interests and that’s the end of it,” he remarked. The Registrar’s Anxiety (Which Has Ended) Over Pavlos Possibly today—or at the latest tomorrow—the former royal family will take action regarding their citizenship. Whether their lawyer will show up, as happened with Michel de Grèce, or Pavlos himself will make an appearance, I can’t say for sure. However, what I can say is that yesterday at the Athens Registry Office, there was quite a commotion, with phones ringing off the hook as employees scrambled to handle all the technical details of the forthcoming request. This was complicated by the fact that certain procedures have been digitized since the Venizelos law. After all, it’s not every day that the former royal family gets added to the records. I hear that written instructions were issued yesterday by the Ministry of the Interior to ensure everything goes smoothly when the request is made. The process is simple: the request is submitted, the Registry Office forwards it to the Ministry of the Interior along with the required documents, and the Ministry determines whether the applicant can be registered or not. That’s what we reported this morning. Eventually, at 11 a.m., it was confirmed that Pavlos and Nikolaos submitted the relevant application at the Athens Registry Office through their proxy lawyer. The surname they chose is “De Grèce,” and a total of 10 members of the former royal family have signed the application. Elections in the Regional Unions It’s a day of decisions for the Union of Greek Regions, as today the successor to Tzitzikostas will be chosen. The role is expected to go to the governor of the South Aegean, Giorgos Hatzimarkos. Following Nikos Hardalias’ announcement that he is withdrawing from the Presidency, the first vice-presidency is set to go to the governor of Crete, Stavros Arnaoutakis, and the second vice-presidency to the governor of the Peloponnese, Dimitris Ptochos. 5% Decrease in Abstention Due to Electoral Roll Cleanup The Ministry of the Interior has received very few applications to reverse deletions from the electoral rolls. This means that in the next national elections, the number of registered voters will be approximately 440,000 fewer. These are individuals aged 80 and above who have had no physical presence in the country or have passed away but had not been removed from the rolls until now due to unreported deaths to the relevant Greek authorities. These individuals contribute to the abstention rates, inflating them by about 5%. Parliament’s New Year Under the Shadow of Presidential Speculation Parliament will suspend its work tonight for the holiday season and is expected to reopen on January 8. Don’t ask me about the legislative agenda because I estimate that the only topic occupying the political and journalistic scene will be the individual proposed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis for the position of President of the Republic. The Prime Minister stated in his interview with ERT that he would reveal the name within the second half of January, triggering another wave of speculation. The official process is expected to commence in Parliament in early February 2025. According to the Constitution, the absolute deadline for the first vote is February 13, one month before the end of Katerina Sakellaropoulou’s term. The first vote requires a majority of 200 MPs; the same threshold applies for the second vote, which takes place five days later. The third vote lowers the threshold to 180 MPs, the fourth to 151 MPs, and, finally, the fifth requires only a relative majority. Poor Anagnostopoulos, what a fate you’ve met After the €5.5 million fines issued yesterday to eight multinational companies, and with more likely to follow for retail chains, no one would want to be in the shoes of the General Secretary of Commerce and Consumer Protection, S. Anagnostopoulos. The General Secretary has been invited tomorrow, Friday, to speak at an internal event of SELPE, the association of major retail chains. The big retail chains are up in arms over the fines, as they believe that the system implemented by the ministry is intentionally convoluted and complex, aimed at imposing fines they deem to serve public relations purposes. So tomorrow, Anagnostopoulos is expected to face heavy pressure as they demand clear rules. Meanwhile, note that a total of 26 companies—multinationals, food manufacturers, and other consumer goods firms, as well as supermarket chains—are under investigation to determine if they comply with the law on profit margin caps. Yesterday’s announcements involved eight companies, so expect more to come in the next few days. The last law passed by Parliament for 2024 extends the validity of the law on “caps on gross profit margins for all products essential for consumer nutrition and dignified living” until April 2025. For now, the government’s intention—provided market conditions stabilize—is not to extend the measure further beyond April, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Hotels: A new investor for Attica Banks are aiming to increase their financing and are closely monitoring tenders and other processes for the sale of European banks’ maritime loan portfolios. Piraeus Bank has taken a significant step by providing over €100 million in financing following a competitive process to the Cypriot Thanos Resort & Hotels, owned by Thanos Michaelides. Michaelides plans to expand his presence in Greece’s hotel sector. The group, which includes the Anassa in Paphos, intends to invest in Attica and Milos. The race to break the €4 barrier Speaking of Piraeus Bank, its stock is once again approaching the €4 mark—the level at which a placement was made last March for 27% of the share capital. Since then, the stock has only managed to stay above this level for three trading sessions, closing at the same price on three other occasions, with an intraday high of €4.08. Yesterday it closed at €3.91, showing an inclination to move toward €4. However, there’s often a gap between intention and reality. We’ll see if the stock gets closer to the generous target prices given by analysts, which range from €5 (Deutsche Bank), €5.90 (JPM), and even €6.31 (Eurobank Equities). Salary increases at SEV The new president of SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises), Spyros Theodoropoulos, brings extensive experience in business transformations and restructuring. He’s undertaking a similar effort at SEV, implementing a new organizational chart and redistributing responsibilities. The goal is to bring SEV’s members closer to society and to activate all members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee in SEV’s daily operations. This ambitious effort demands considerable work from SEV’s 60 employees, which is why one of the new administration’s first decisions was to significantly increase their salaries. Manousakis’ term at ADMIE renewed Last night, ADMIE Holdings sent a letter to the Chinese State Grid announcing the renewal of the term of ADMIE SA’s Chairman and CEO, Manos Manousakis. The term has been renewed for four years. The Board of Directors will meet tomorrow, Friday, to approve the renewal. €110 million investments in clean energy storage Staying in the energy sector, Deputy Energy Minister Alexandra Sdoukou met yesterday with representatives of 15 companies selected in the first two energy storage tenders. The government aims to expedite the construction of energy storage stations, offering operational support and investment aid. Investors, who collectively are investing €110 million in lithium battery energy storage systems, highlighted key issues they face, primarily the need for new connection infrastructure, such as the development or expansion of substations and networks. These processes are often delayed due to lengthy equipment procurement timelines. Additionally, delays in licensing procedures that impact overall project progress were also discussed. Sdoukou pledged to support each case individually, announcing the creation of a special coordination team. This team will work closely with ADMIE, RAE, and DAPEEP to resolve all licensing and technical issues. Timely project completion is critical, as they are funded by the Recovery Fund under strict deadlines. Let’s see if anything gets done! Lavipharm’s Investment Lavipharm’s new investment in transdermal drug production is set to launch in early 2025. The modifications and expansion of part of the production facilities in Paiania have already been completed, and the mechanical equipment is arriving in Greece in the coming period. This investment is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical company’s business plan, as it will double its transdermal production capacity, while the addition of the new production line ensures uninterrupted manufacturing. Over the past five years, Lavipharm has achieved a 55% increase in its market share, and its management has stated that it is exploring opportunities for new drug acquisitions while also making new moves focused on pharmaceutical production. Alumil’s “Trump Trade” Alumil, led by G. Mylonas, is steadily moving towards a market capitalization of €150 million. Its stock, now at €4.59, is 58.2% higher than three months ago. After struggling through the tough years of 2013–2022 and eventually reaching an agreement with banks and servicers to handle its heavy debt load, Alumil is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. The next step is to spin off its casting division and sell 70% of the new company (Alufond) to a foreign investor. G. Mylonas, encouraged by Trump’s election, has turned his gaze across the Atlantic, aiming to finalize the deal within the first quarter of 2025. Even if it slips to the second quarter, it’s no big deal—after all, in the market, you hear a lot of talk but see little action. Window Dressing Next week, the Athens Stock Exchange will remain closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after. Opportunities for short-term investment strategies are extremely limited. The primary goal of window dressing remains a top priority. As previously mentioned, Piraeus Bank aims to bridge the gap to the €4 placement level (yesterday it closed at €3.91, up +1.79%) so that those who invested at that time don’t end the year in the red. Similarly, National Bank has risen to €7.70 (+1.45%), Athens International Airport to €8, Cenergy to €9.25, and so on. By Tuesday, December 31, everyone will close their books with satisfaction and present the results of their efforts to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. These movements, coupled with the lack of large-scale strategic placements, have brought the General Index to 1,455.67 points, with a modest increase of +0.2%. While trading volume may appear higher, it isn’t—of the €155.3 million total, €57.1 million came from a large Eurobank package and several smaller ones, leaving €85 million in stock trades on the board. Once again, Coca-Cola HBC, typically the General Index’s reliable supporter, remained at €32.80 (-1.5%), leaving OPAP (+2.21% at €15.74) and Motor Oil (+1.38%) to take over its role. Meanwhile, a consistent seller is holding PPC at €11.70, despite analysts’ glowing reports making headlines. Nuclear Energy and Artificial Intelligence: Parallel Paths Yesterday, Meta published an RFP (Request for Proposals) seeking a provider for a nuclear energy installation of up to 4 gigawatts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. This move reflects a broader trend in the artificial intelligence industry, where the exponential growth in computational requirements is creating unprecedented demand for stable and reliable energy. Meta’s strategy to place nuclear plants near its data centers aims to minimize energy transmission losses. Given that Meta is already the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U.S., with 6.7 GW in operation, this step marks a new era where nuclear energy suddenly emerges as a key pillar for the growth of artificial intelligence.

Archives An intensification of surface Earth’s energy imbalance since the late 20th century, Li et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm−2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm−2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown. Fusion of Probabilistic Projections of Sea-Level Rise, Grandey et al., Earth's Future: A probabilistic projection of sea-level rise uses a probability distribution to represent scientific uncertainty. However, alternative probabilistic projections of sea-level rise differ markedly, revealing ambiguity, which poses a challenge to scientific assessment and decision-making. To address the challenge of ambiguity, we propose a new approach to quantify a best estimate of the scientific uncertainty associated with sea-level rise. Our proposed fusion combines the complementary strengths of the ice sheet models and expert elicitations that were used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under a low-emissions scenario, the fusion's very likely range (5th–95th percentiles) of global mean sea-level rise is 0.3–1.0 m by 2100. Under a high-emissions scenario, the very likely range is 0.5–1.9 m. The 95th percentile projection of 1.9 m can inform a high-end storyline, supporting decision-making for activities with low uncertainty tolerance. By quantifying a best estimate of scientific uncertainty, the fusion caters to diverse users. Earth's Climate History Explains Life's Temperature Optima, Schipper et al., Ecology and Evolution: Why does the growth of most life forms exhibit a narrow range of optimal temperatures below 40°C? We hypothesize that the recently identified stable range of oceanic temperatures of ~5 to 37°C for more than two billion years of Earth history tightly constrained the evolution of prokaryotic thermal performance curves to optimal temperatures for growth to less than 40°C. We tested whether competitive mechanisms reproduced the observed upper limits of life's temperature optima using simple Lotka–Volterra models of interspecific competition between organisms with different temperature optima. Model results supported our proposition whereby organisms with temperature optima up to 37°C were most competitive. Model results were highly robust to a wide range of reasonable variations in temperature response curves of modeled species. We further propose that inheritance of prokaryotic genes and subsequent co-evolution with microbial partners may have resulted in eukaryotes also fixing their temperature optima within this narrow temperature range. We hope this hypothesis will motivate considerable discussion and future work to advance our understanding of the remarkable consistency of the temperature dependence of life. Widespread outdoor exposure to uncompensable heat stress with warming, Fan & McColl, Communications Earth & Environment: Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events. ["uncompensable" means physiologically intolerable, acutely dangerous, ultimately deadly] Stabilising CO2 concentration as a channel for global disaster risk mitigation, Lu & Tambakis, Scientific Report: We investigate the influence of anthropogenic CO2 concentration fluctuations on the likelihood of climate-related disasters. We calibrate annual incidence rates against global disasters and CO2 growth spanning from 1960 to 2022 based on a dynamic panel logit model. We also study the sensitivity of disaster incidence to stochastic carbon dynamics consistent with IPCC-projected climate outcomes for 2100. The key insight is that present and lagged CO2 growth contains valuable information about the likelihood of future disaster events. We further show that lowering carbon stock uncertainty by dampening the persistence or the variability of CO2 concentration has a first-order impact on mitigating expected disaster risk. Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment, DeVerna et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) used for fact-checking affect the perception and dissemination of political news headlines. Despite the growing adoption of AI and tests of its ability to counter online misinformation, little is known about how people respond to LLM-driven fact-checking. This experiment reveals that even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users’ abilities to discern headline accuracy or promote accurate news sharing. LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is unsure about an article’s veracity. These findings underscore the need for research on AI fact-checking’s unintended consequences, informing policies to enhance information integrity in the digital age. Droughts in Wind and Solar Power: Assessing Climate Model Simulations for a Net-Zero Energy Future, Liu et al., Geophysical Research Letters: Understanding and predicting “droughts” in wind and solar power availability can help the electric grid operator planning and operation toward deep renewable penetration. We assess climate models' ability to simulate these droughts at different horizontal resolutions, ∼100 and ∼25 km, over Western North America and Texas. We find that these power droughts are associated with the high/low pressure systems. The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes. This suggests that regional response to future warming can vary considerably in high- and low-resolution models. These insights have important implications for adapting power system planning and operations to the changing climate.

One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance. Most articles appearing here are found via RSS feeds from journal publishers, filtered by search terms to produce raw output for assessment of relevance. Relevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database. The objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only: A few journals offer public access to "preprint" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as "preprint." The section "Informed opinion, nudges & major initiatives" includes some items that are not scientific research per se but fall instead into the category of "perspectives," observations of implications of research findings, areas needing attention, etc. Please let us know if you're aware of an article you think may be of interest for Skeptical Science research news, or if we've missed something that may be important. Send your input to Skeptical Science via our contact form. A list of journals we cover may be found here. We welcome pointers to omissions, new journals etc. The previous edition of Skeptical Science New Research may be found here. 0 0 Printable Version | Link to this page There have been no comments posted yet.
