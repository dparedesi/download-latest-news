ByCharlie Fink ByCharlie Fink, Contributor. Legal win for AI industry? A U.S. federal judge ruled that Anthropic’s use of copyrighted books to train its AI model Claude qualifies as fair use. Judge William Alsup likened it to a writer learning from prior work. However, he found Anthropic liable for copyright infringement for storing over 7 million pirated books in a central repository unrelated to training. That storage was not protected under fair use. Damages could be as high as $150,000 per infraction. A trial in December will address potential damages. Alphabets AI on advanced central processing unit (CPU) chip and gavel and sound block in wireframe ... More on electronic mother boards. Illustration of the concept of legislation and regulations of AI Act In the Northern District of California, U.S. federal judge Vince Chhabria, dismissed a copyright lawsuit from 13 authors against Meta. The plaintiffs, which include Sarah Silverman and Ta‑Nehisi Coates, claimed Meta improperly used their books to train its Llama AI model. The court found the plaintiffs failed to show market harm or dilution, and granted summary judgment for Meta. The decision applies only to the specific authors involved and does not affirm that Meta’s data use is lawful across the board. On Last Week Tonight, John Oliver skewered the rise of “AI slop,” mass-produced, low-effort content flooding social media. In previous weeks, I’ve shared anthropomorphic cat dramas, and vlogs from Storm Troopers, Bigfoot and Jesus. It’s entertaining. It’s designed to go viral, and earn ad money. But, argues Oliver, it’s slop that drowns out real content. One landscape designer complains she can’t find pictures of real gardens on Pinterest anymore. Chronicle co-founders Aaron Sisto (l) and Chris deFaria (r) Chronicle Bets $12 Million AI Can Spot A Billion Dollar Franchise Chronicle's founders think social platforms are where tomorrow’s blockbuster entertainment properties will be born, and they are using AI to grow them.

(Photo by WANG Zhao / AFP) (Photo by WANG ZHAO/AFP via Getty Images) Xiaomi has unveiled its AI-first smartglasses—officially named Xiaomi AI Glasses (yes, really). Like Meta’s Ray-Bans, there’s no display. Instead, they use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon AR1 chip and Xiaomi’s Hyper XiaoAi assistant to deliver voice-based responses triggered by speech and touch. With no screen or HUD, the emphasis is on audio-driven utility and lightweight design. The glasses feature a 12MP stabilized camera, five mics, dual speakers, and electrochromic lenses that darken on demand. They weigh just 40 grams, support Alipay QR payments, and offer up to 21 hours of standby. Shipping in September, they start at ¥1,999 (about $280) and come in three colors.

ARtillery Intelligence’s June 2025 report projects headworn AR revenue to grow from $2.6 billion in 2024 to $13.05 billion in 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of nearly 38 percent. This growth is led by enterprise productivity use cases, currently accounting for over 70 percent of market revenue. But consumer adoption is accelerating fast thanks to the success of “lite AR” smart glasses like Ray-Ban Meta. These tier-3, audio-first, non-display glasses have validated a new design direction: style-forward, AI-powered wearables that prioritize utility over immersion. Meta’s success has prompted rapid follow-on moves from Apple, Google (via Android XR), and Snap, with key consumer AR glasses expected by 2026–2027. ARtillery anticipates a major inflection in 2027 as these players enter the market.

DAZN has launched a free Horizon OS app on Meta Quest (Quest 2, 3, 3S, and Pro) that lets US users stream all FIFA Club World Cup matches in 3D.

The quarter-finals, semi-finals, and final will also be available in 180° VR, similar to the NBA’s setup. Matches begin July 4, with finals July 13. Although the Club World Cup is US-hosted, this experience is only available to US-based Quest users.

Title: Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi on ‘the most significant launch we’ve ever had in our history’

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Earlier this week, I had a chance to chat with Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi and play with the four AI-powered agents that are rolling out next week for Quickbooks Online. It’s the first time I’ve seen agents deployed so effectively in handing off tasks to each other while helping humans be more productive. (I did enjoy seeing Cognizant’s Babak Hodjat create multi-agent systems on the spot at the Fortune COO Summit earlier this month, but many of us will deploy agents, not create them.) Intuit has four themed agents—a customer one for spotting leads in emails, drafting emails, and tracking interactions to the point of sales; one for payments to streamline and speed up that process; another for finance, to analyze and help you boost the health of your business; and a fourth for accounting, to reconcile expenses and make your bookkeepers happy. If I’d had this a decade ago, I might have remained an entrepreneur. “By far, this is the most significant launch we’ve ever had in our history because it’s end-to-end,” Goodarzi told me. “The fact that we have launched a virtual team that can do a lot of work, from managing your leads to making sure you get paid and your accounting is done, and it’s a combination of AI and humans doing the work. It’s been in the works for six years.” “It’s not about workflows,” he said. “It’s about a business feed that does everything for the customer while they’re always in control. And it’s not just about technology; it’s also about human expertise because, in our world, even Millennials, they want the reassurance of a human.” When I asked Goodarzi to reflect on what this means for the identity of a company that most associate with taxes and accounting, he said: “I want us to be known as the money company because of how we help businesses and consumers.”More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com U.S.-China trade deal The U.S. and China have reached an “understanding” on trade in which China will supply rare earth minerals to the U.S. and in return, “we’ll take down our countermeasures,” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg. Trump’s sons are considering a dynasty Eric Trump told the FT that he or Donald Jr., Ivanka, or his wife Lara might continue their father’s legacy in politics. “I think I could do it,” Eric Trump said. “And by the way, I think other members of our family could do it too.” Meta did not pay those guys $100 million Lucas Beyer, one of three OpenAI researchers who lead Sam Altman’s Zurich office, said on X that they did not get paid $100 million to join Mark Zuckerberg’s company. “No, we did not get 100M sign-on, that's fake news,” he said. Citi stock worth $100 a share, analyst says Citi chief Jane Fraser has suffered months of negative headlines but yesterday she got some good news. Bank of America analyst Ebrahim Poonawala rated the stock a “buy” with a price target of $100, and said Fraser’s reforms are working. The stock closed last night at $84.37. Two senior execs leave Tesla Omead Afshar, head sales and operations in North America and Europe, and Jenna Ferrua, director of North American HR, have exited Tesla, following a tough period for the company: Q1 vehicle deliveries fell 13% and profit declined 71%. Trump v the judges The White House sued all 15 federal judges in Maryland for opposing his deportation program. The normal method for disputing a judicial ruling would be to appeal a decision. The suit thus puts the Trump Administration on a legal collision course with the judiciary over which branch of government has a superior level of power. New York real estate developers in panic over Mamdani If Zohran Mamdani wins the NYC mayor’s race, it “would be the death penalty for the city,” Danny Fishman, CEO of Gaia Real Estate, told the WSJ. “And it would be the best thing to happen to Miami and Palm Beach since Covid.” Mamdani favors rent control, and New York’s property moguls are organizing to back almost anyone who might be able to beat him. Bill Ackman makes a pledge Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is looking to bankroll a candidate who can take down Democratic frontrunner Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral election. He shared that he and his associates have “hundreds of millions of dollars” at the ready, and once they find the person for the job, “the funds will pour in.” Not made in the USA The Trump Organization is no longer claiming that its T1 phone will be made in the U.S., now opting instead for more vague descriptions of the product on its website like, “designed with American values in mind.” This switch up comes less than two weeks after the company announced its new brand.

June 26, 2025 17:45 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, June 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a forward share split for the GraniteShares 2x Long PLTR (the “Fund”). The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of these splits. After the close of the markets on July 08, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a forward split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: As a result of the share split, shareholders of the Fund will receive fifteen shares for each share held as indicated in the table above. Accordingly, the number of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares will increase by the approximate percentage indicated above. The ticker and CUSIP will not be affected by the transaction. The share split will apply to shareholders of record as of the close of the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on July 08, 2025 (the “Record Date”), payable after the close of the NASDAQ on the Payable Date. Shares of the Funds will begin trading on the NASDAQ on a split-adjusted basis on July 09, 2025 (the “Ex-Date”). On the Ex-Date, the opening market value of the Fund’s issued and outstanding shares, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the share split. However, the per share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price on the Ex-Date will be approximately one-fifteenth. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical fifteen-for-one split on a shareholder’s investment. 15-for-1 forward split About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares offers the following leveraged single stock ETFs: In addition, GraniteShares’ ETF suite includes the following ETFs: (1) GraniteShares Advisors LLC has contractually agreed to waive its fees and/or pay for operating expenses of the Fund to ensure that total annual fund operating expenses (exclusive of any (i) interest, (ii) brokerage fees and commission, (iii) acquired fund fees and expenses, (iv) fees and expenses associated with instruments in other collective investment vehicles or derivative instruments (including for example options and swap fees and expenses), (v) interest and dividend expense on short sales, (vi) taxes, (vii) other fees related to underlying investments (such as option fees and expenses or swap fees and expenses), (viii) expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization or (ix) extraordinary expenses such as litigation) will not exceed 1.15%. This agreement is effective until December 31, 2025, and it may be terminated before that date only by the Trust’s Board of Trustees. GraniteShares Advisors LLC may request recoupment of previously waived fees and paid expenses from the Fund for three years from the date such fees and expenses were waived or paid, if such reimbursement will not cause the Fund’s total expense ratio to exceed the expense limitation in place at the time of the waiver and/or expense payment and the expense limitation in place at the time of the recoupment.(2) Estimated total cost in the absence of fee waiver or reimbursement.Contact Information:William Rhind, CEOGraniteShares Inc+1 646 876 5049william.rhind@graniteshares.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the GraniteShares funds (the “Funds”) carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747, or visit the website at www.graniteshares.com.

There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares in a Fund will develop or be maintained. Shares may trade above or below NAV. Brokerage commissions will apply. Fund Risks Multiple funds have a limited operating history of less than a year and risks associated with a new fund. The Leveraged and Daily Inverse Funds are not suitable for all investors. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by most ETFs and mutual funds. Investments in the ETFs are not bank deposits and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund is designed to be utilized only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily leveraged (2X) or daily inverse (-1X and -2X) investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Fund will lose money even if the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The funds do not directly invest in the underlying stock. The Funds seek daily inverse or leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. Each Fund with “Long” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the respective long leveraged multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each a Leveraged Long Fund). Each Fund with “Short” in its name attempts to provide daily investment results that correspond to the inverse (or opposite) multiple of the performance of an underlying stock (each an Inverse Fund). Investors should note that the Long Leveraged Funds and the Daily Inverse Funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives and daily inverse investment objectives (respectively), which means that the fund is riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage and inverse strategies because the fund magnifies the performance of their underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect a Funds' return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. For the Leveraged Long Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. For the Daily Inverse Funds because of daily rebalancing and the compounding of each day’s return over time, the return of the Fund for periods longer than a single day will be the result of each day’s returns compounded over the period, which will very likely differ from -100% and 200% of the return of the Underlying Stock over the same period. The Fund will lose money if the Underlying Stock’s performance is flat over time, and as a result of daily rebalancing, the Underlying Stock volatility and the effects of compounding, it is even possible that the Fund will lose money over time while the Underlying Stock’s performance decreases over a period longer than a single day. Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the ETF. There can be no guarantee that an active trading market for ETF shares will develop or be maintained, or that their listing will continue or remain unchanged. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions and frequent trading may incur brokerage costs that detract significantly from investment returns. An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. The Fund is non-diversified and includes risks associated with the Fund concentrating its investments in a particular industry, sector, or geographic region which can result in increased volatility. The use of derivatives such as futures contracts and swaps are subject to market risks that may cause their price to fluctuate over time. Risks of the Fund include Effects of Compounding and Market Volatility Risk, Inverse Risk, Market Risk, Counterparty Risk, Rebalancing Risk, Intra-Day Investment Risk, Daily Index Correlation Risk, Other Investment Companies (including ETFs) Risk, and risks specific to the securities of the Underlying Stock and the sector in which it operates. These and other risks can be found in the prospectus. Investing in physical commodities, including through commodity-linked derivative instruments such as Commodity Futures, Commodity Swaps, as well as other commodity-linked instruments, is speculative and can be extremely volatile and may not be suitable for all investors. Market prices of commodities may fluctuate rapidly based on numerous factors, including: changes in supply and demand relationships (whether actual, perceived, anticipated, unanticipated or unrealized); weather; agriculture; trade; domestic and foreign political and economic events and policies; diseases; pestilence; technological developments; currency exchange rate fluctuations; and monetary and other governmental policies, action and inaction. A liquid secondary market may not exist for the types of commodity-linked derivative instruments the Fund buys, which may make it difficult for the Fund to sell them at an acceptable price. The Fund is new with no operating history. As a result, there can be no assurance that the Fund will grow to or maintain an economically viable size, in which case it could ultimately liquidate. Derivatives may be more sensitive to changes in market conditions and may amplify risks and losses. This information is not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of any Funds to any person in any jurisdiction in which an offer, solicitation, purchase or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Please consult your tax advisor about the tax consequences of an investment in Fund shares, including the possible application of foreign, state, and local tax laws. You could lose money by investing in the ETFs. There can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Funds will be achieved.

PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security.

The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Title: CoreWeave revives bid for Core Scientific causing shares to surge 33%

CORZ shares jumped nearly 34% on intraday fueled by the acquisition rumors. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. CoreWeave is negotiating to acquire Bitcoin (BTC) miner-turned-compute host Core Scientific, the Wall Street Journal reported on June 26, citing people familiar with the matter. The cloud infrastructure company attempted to acquire the miner for $5.75 per share in June 2024 but withdrew after Core Scientific’s board deemed the price inadequate. Core Scientific and CoreWeave have not issued public statements on the negotiations. Core Scientific’s CORZ stock was trading at $16.44 as of press time, up 33.7% on the session and more than 3x from last year’s proposal. The rally followed a year-to-date slide of about 15% that left the miner trading well below the all-time high it set after emerging from bankruptcy protection in January. CoreWeave, which went public in March with a $75 billion capitalization, lists Microsoft as its largest customer, accounting for 62% of 2024 revenue, and rents Nvidia GPUs to corporate clients that include Meta Platforms and IBM. Executives at Core Scientific dismissed last year’s $1 billion overture as “unsolicited” and below intrinsic value, then signed 12-year hosting agreements that commit the miner to deliver 200 megawatts (MW) of power for CoreWeave’s high-performance-computing clusters. Board members stated at the time that the arrangement would generate approximately $3.5 billion in cumulative revenue and help diversify income away from block subsidies after the April 2024 Bitcoin halving. Core Scientific already hosts 16 MW of CoreWeave GPUs at its Austin campus, and plans staged expansions across several sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The parties allegedly aim to finalize terms within weeks if talks stay on track, the sources said. Yet, neither side disclosed price parameters. Core Scientific’s rapid pivot toward AI infrastructure, combined with a power-constrained data-center market, could justify a premium well above the miner’s undisturbed value, bankers following the situation noted. CoreWeave CEO Mike Intrator seeks to expand capacity to meet the cloud-AI demand that exceeds current inventory across hyperscale providers. Core Scientific controls about 724 megawatts of contracted power across its US footprint and ranks among North America’s top owners of immersion-cooled mining rigs. The miner’s ability to repurpose part of that load for GPU computing aligns with CoreWeave’s push to secure low-cost electricity and ready-built shells, avoiding multiyear greenfield construction. If negotiations succeed, CoreWeave will absorb a fleet of Bitmain S21-class miners and a pipeline of brownfield sites that can flip to GPU racks. Core Scientific shareholders would receive cash or stock at a yet-to-be-determined ratio.

Title: Black Friday Email Marketing Strategy: 10 Tips and Examples (2025) - Shopify Ireland
URL: https://www.shopify.com/ie/enterprise/blog/customer-lifetime-value-after-black-friday-cyber-monday
Time Published: 2025-06-26T18:05:16Z
Full Content:
Black Friday is one of the biggest sales events of the year. Last year, Shopify merchants drove a record-breaking $11.5 billion in sales during the Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) weekend. With so many consumers open to shopping during the holiday weekend, leaning on tried and tested marketing channels can open the floodgates to more revenue in the fourth quarter. For many retailers, that’s email marketing. Email is the third-most influential channel on holiday purchase decisions, beating influencer endorsements, in-person experiences, and conversations with retail associates in-store. But when so many retailers rely on this direct line of communication to promote holiday sales, it’s difficult to stand out in a subscriber’s crowded inbox. This guide shares innovative Black Friday email marketing strategies to try this year, with best practices and examples from leading retailers. Customer data is the most valuable asset any ecommerce business has. It allows you to tailor email outreach and deliver on customers’ expectations for a personalized shopping experience. Yet 85% of internet users want to do more to protect their online privacy, meaning this strategy can be difficult to implement. Before the holiday season arrives, take stock of the customer data you currently have. If your email list is small or you don’t have supplementary information to personalize campaigns to existing subscribers, deploy lead generation campaigns to gather more holiday season customer data. For example: Because Shopify offers a customer data platform (CDP) by default, any first-party data you’ve collected on your customers gets combined in a unified customer profile. Whenever they share their email address or phone number, this data—such as their order history, loyalty points they’ve earned, previous emails they’ve opened, and/or customer service tickets they’ve raised—all funnel back to one place, giving you one source of truth for every shopper. Black Friday might only last one day, but consumers are still open to making holiday purchases in the run up to the big event. Klaviyo found that more than half of consumers think a month earlier than November is the ideal time for brands to initiate their holiday shopping season sales. Most retailers start seeding their Black Friday email promotions 21 days before the big event—a strategy dubbed “Black November,” which includes other holiday shopping dates: The majority of consumers look for discounts and sales during this period—so much so, 7 in 10 consider price the top factor in their holiday purchase decisions, beating quality (61%), variety (34%), and warranties or returns policies (31%). Take advantage of consumers’ openness to pre-Black Friday promotions by creating a holiday calendar. Perhaps you give your email list early access to your sale, or build hype around a new product drop by teasing it to subscribers, with an automated series like this: Not all holiday shoppers are the same. Some might be looking for gifts for a loved one—others might want to take advantage of a hefty discount to buy a product that’s been on their wishlist for months. Segmentation allows you to identify these buyer preferences and deliver personalized Black Friday email marketing campaigns. Key Black Friday customer segments to email include: Customers who’ve visited your New Orleans store within the last six months, for instance, could receive an email that invites them to your retail store’s exclusive holiday sale which starts two days before Black Friday. Yet instead of relying solely on historical data to forecast each segment’s next steps, lean on predictive analytics. These tools digest large datasets using machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to accurately predict what a customer will do next. 💡Tip: Shopify’s segmentation features pull data from unified customer profiles to group customers based on qualities they share. Choose from prebuilt segment templates, or build your own with the ShopifyQL query editor. All segments are dynamic—subscribers will move in and out of segments automatically when data from their unified profile changes. Segmentation isn’t the only way to personalize emails around the Black Friday weekend. Dynamic content blocks adjust smaller sections of your email, instead of sending the same email to everyone who fits your segmentation criteria. Let’s say, for example, that you’ve defined a segment of VIP customers to target during Black Friday. Subscribers have one thing in common—they have a customer lifetime value of over $500—but they don’t all share the same buying behaviors. Some have saved the loyalty rewards they’ve earned—others have made a portion of their purchases in-store. Further personalize the Black Friday emails that each subscriber in this segment receives with dynamic content blocks. That could be: Black Friday sales are effective because they’re exclusive—either in terms of product quantity (for example, a limited amount of inventory) or because the promotion ends at a specific time. Lean into this time sensitivity and encourage Black Friday subscribers to take advantage now rather than later. This scarcity can induce the fear of missing out, a psychological phenomenon that influences people to buy even when they didn’t intend on doing so. Effective marketing techniques to create urgency in your Black Friday emails include: reMarkable, for example, has a countdown timer in their email to announce Black Friday is ending. It offers visual representation of when the deal ends, instead of just a generic “Sale ends tonight!” message. Email inboxes are a crowded place to be at the best of times—never mind on Black Friday, when every retailer wants to capitalize on consumers’ willingness to buy. Email marketing platform Omnisend processed 1.13 billion emails in the week surrounding BFCM. Klaviyo reported similar figures: at its peak, merchants sent 420 million messages in a single hour on Black Friday. An email subject line is the first thing that subscribers see when your campaign lands in their inbox. A best practice is to split-test strategies such as: Here are some real examples that incorporate these best practices and stood out to me during the Black Friday weekend last year: Promotions and flash drops can incentivize holiday shoppers to make impulsive purchases. Remove the biggest barrier to them doing so—finding the money to pay for their order—by offering buy now, pay later (BNPL). During the BFCM weekend last year, consumers spent over $686.3 million on BNPL purchases, up 8.8% from the year before. Of those who have used this type of service, almost a third say they’d be more likely to spend money on discretionary goods if the retailer offered BNPL as an option. Shop Pay Installments offers an easy way to add BNPL options at checkout. Customers can choose to divide their purchases into smaller, more manageable installments. Combined with Shop Pay, the best-converting checkout on the internet, it’s no surprise that Shop Pay Installments has been proven to reduce cart abandonment by 28% and increase average order value by as much as 50%. Email might be the only direct line of communication you have with Black Friday customers, but it’s not the only way to command their attention. SMS marketing is the easiest integration since most email marketing platforms, including Klaviyo, offer SMS integration as standard. For example, you could send an email campaign to a particular segment, then use SMS to follow up with those who haven’t yet redeemed the offer or opened the email. It’s an approach proven to get results: Klaviyo reports that merchants who integrated SMS into their Black Friday email marketing strategy experienced a 20% YoY increase in ecommerce revenue during BFCM, accounting for more than $100 million in gross merchandise value. Email can also complement paid advertising strategies as costs skyrocket throughout Black Friday season. Shopify Audiences builds custom retargeting lists to export to platforms like Meta, Google Ads, and TikTok. It’s helped merchants like Happy Hippo achieve a 4.7x return on ad spend (ROAS) while cutting customer acquisition costs (CAC) by 72%. “Shopify Audiences is a huge benefit for Plus merchants,” says CEO and lead product designer Adam Biel. “It has helped lower customer acquisition costs so our investments can stretch much further with Facebook ads.” Transactional emails tend to be overlooked when marketers attempt to compete with other retailers for attention during Black Friday. Yet they’re an opportunity to strengthen relationships with the customers you’ve already acquired. Comb through the automated emails you send as standard when customers complete a certain action. Here are some examples and ideas to optimize them: Black Friday, Cyber Monday regularly break records, but not all of them are good. Most customers acquired during BFCM have a lower lifetime value. This occurs partly because these customers were being opportunistic and taking advantage of your promotions, but also because your brand loses mindshare throughout the year. Design an email retention sequence to retain holiday shoppers after Black Friday ends. You could: 💡Tip: Shopify Flow takes the logistical hassle out of these holiday marketing automations. Work from prebuilt templates—such as inviting shoppers to your loyalty program when their unified customer profile meets specific criteria—or custom code your own. It’s easy to get caught up in the excitement of new promotions and segmentation strategies that turn email subscribers into paying customers—so much so, that retailers often forget the fundamentals. Here’s a quick reminder of the email optimization best practices to keep in mind while writing Black Friday emails: If you’re in the midst of a creative lull and are searching for ideas on how to make your Black Friday emails stand out, draw inspiration from these examples. Shoppers are especially prone to abandoning online carts in search of better Black Friday deals. This cart recovery email from Pulp & Press reminds each individual customer of the products they abandoned, with a reminder that it’s the biggest sale of the year—and that they should take advantage now, before the deal ends. Black Friday might be the biggest online sales event of the year, but it’s not always the most profitable. Discounts tend to lure in low-value customers who might only purchase from you when products are heavily discounted. Detox Market’s Black Friday email is a great example of how to combat this with tiered promotions. The more customers spend, the bigger the discount. Freaks of Nature leans into scarcity with their “almost gone” Black Friday email. The call to action button tells people to “secure” their shirt—more strategic than just “get yours today.” Plus, it uses price anchoring to showcase the before and after sale price of each bestseller. There are also direct checkout links for email subscribers to complete their purchases without searching the online store for the perfect item. It’s tempting to shout about your bestselling products or hefty discounts with innovative email designs. Home furnishings brand Revival takes a different approach. Instead, the brand shares a letter authored by their founder, which wishes them a wonderful holiday weekend with a gentle nudge to buy the item on their wishlist. The email also features a note beneath the sign-off that teases the following day’s email. This tactic can increase open rates during Black Friday—subscribers are already on the lookout for the campaign. With so much competition to reach your target market during Black Friday, leaning into your brand values can attract conscious consumers who care more about sticking to their morals than impressive discounts. Deodorant brand Fussy, for example, is a certified B-Corp that sells deodorants made with natural ingredients and refillable cases designed to reduce plastic waste. Their target audience cares about sustainability, hence why the retailer’s Black Friday email marketing strategy was to rename the event “Green Week.” Email marketing spans every stage of the customer journey, from aiding initial product discovery to encouraging customer retention. Shopify has everything you need to personalize this end-to-end experience, including unified customer profiles and segmentation to put your data to work. Plus, when holiday email campaigns drive record levels of website traffic, you don’t have to worry about outages or downtime. Shopify’s infrastructure handled over 57.3 PB of data, 1.19 trillion edge requests, and 10.5 trillion database queries during the last BFCM. It’s why leading brands like Represent, Knix, and Muscle Nation trust Shopify to capitalize on Black Friday sales. “Black Friday can be nerve-wracking,” says Stefan Lewis, chief digital officer at Represent. “But Shopify has always helped us in terms of increasing bandwidth and we’ve never run into any issues around site speed.” Black Friday Cyber Monday (BFCM) email is a marketing strategy where retailers reach their target customers through targeted emails. These holiday campaigns typically include promotions, sales, discounts, gift suggestions, and product recommendations. To write an effective Black Friday email, lead with a time-sensitive offer in the subject line and header. Use mobile-first design, highlight bestsellers or exclusives, and include urgency-driven CTAs like “get yours before it’s too late.” The best time to send Black Friday emails is in the runup to the big event. Most consumers start holiday gift shopping before Black Friday arrives. A pre-launch campaign can ensure your brand is top of mind when they’re ready to buy. Use targeted emails to announce a Black Friday sale. Divide your audience into segments based on traits they share, and include contextual recommendations—for example, discounts on products similar to those they’ve bought.

Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficultâor impossibleâto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factorsâsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)âcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysisâa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "â¦any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "â¦total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10â The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "â¦agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking processâmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a ruleâan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefitsâsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scopeâbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insightsâespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity frameworkâthe net stable funding ratioâwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisionsâsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trialsâwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "â¦ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groupsâit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirementsâwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional windowâhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policyâand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them. Return to text 3. See Executive Order No. 12866, 58 Federal Register 51735 (October 4, 1993) and Circular A-4: Regulatory Analysis, Office of Management and Budget, Executive Office of the President (final-2003 and proposed-2023 versions). Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "â¦all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)â¦" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms â which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post. Return to text 19. In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same systemâand incur a similar absolute costâas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27.

See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and Rösch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al.

The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017).

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang begins sale of $925M worth of Nvidia stock — sale of 6 million shares barely dents his $123 billion in shares

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company’s stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company’s stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang’s timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia’s value hit record highs. This also isn’t the first time that Nvidia’s C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia’s massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, surging along with stock markets despite fears of a “Doomsday” scenario for the markets and the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared back toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, up around 50% from its April lows and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump surprising traders with a “massive” crypto prediction. Now, as the crypto market braces for a Congress game-changer predicted to “unleash” trillions, a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price to a $5 trillion market capitalization by 2030—putting it alongside technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The "de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism" has been named as the ... More driving force behind a huge $5 trillion bitcoin price prediction. Philippe Laffont, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, has added bitcoin to his Fantastic 40 list, a collection of investments he thinks will be the biggest winners over the next five years. Laffont’s list, which features Microsoft, Nvidia, bitcoin, Amazon and Meta as the top five and doesn't include tech giants Apple or Google at all, can be seen in full here. "I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, ‘why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in [bitcoin]?' And it just goes up and up," Laffont told CNBC, adding that, “sometimes you have to change your mind and you have to say, well, 'I made a mistake.'” According to Laffont, who claims he hasn't bought bitcoin yet, its price could more than double to give bitcoin a market capitalization of over $5 trillion by 2030, with Microsoft forecast to soar to $5.7 trillion and Nvidia to $5.6 trillion. "I always thought, bitcoin's amazing, but it's double or triple the volatility of the Nasdaq," Laffont said. "It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down."

Laffont pointed to the gold's $22 trillion market cap as justification for bitcoin's performance over the next few years, along with "the de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism." The U.S. Dollar Index, which measures the value of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, has declined 10% year-to-date, hit by growing fears over the $37 trillion U.S. debt pile and that inflation, which spiraled out of control in the aftermath of Covid-era money printing and lockdowns, could return. Earlier this month Jim Esposito, the president of market maker Citadel Securities, called U.S. debt a “ticking time bomb” as it revealed plans to ramp up its bitcoin and crypto trading.

Title: AMD's AI Moment May Be Coming. Will It Seize It?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDONESIA - 2025/06/16: In this photo illustration, the AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) logo is seen ... More displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that?

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Use the controls in the far right panel to increase or decrease the number of terms automatically displayed (or to completely turn that feature off). Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: “CAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions” and #2221803: “Collaborative Research: CAS—Climate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.” Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5–3.0 °C energy decarbonisation pathways, Šimaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Δ The rise took the company’s market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company’s latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company’s stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company’s total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a “chip company” but rather as a provider of “AI infrastructure” or “computing platform,” per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,” Huang said. “Nvidia is ready.” Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks’ Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Nvidia Rises to Record as AI Spending Momentum Stays Strong

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia’s growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls

Full Content:
Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify, via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. Grabar Law Office is investigating whether officers and directors of DoubleVerify breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

Why? A recently filed securities fraud class action complaint alleges that Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ: MANH), through certain of its officers, provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. These statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company’s ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services.The underlying complaint alleges that Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Manhattan Associates’ forecasting ability for its professional services; notably, the Company was either not truly equipped to deliver “responsible targets” for growth or, otherwise, Manhattan Associates’ services were not equipped to achieve such targets. Finally, the Complaint alleges that such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Manhattan Associates’ securities at artificially inflated prices. What You Can Do Now: Current Manhattan Associates shareholders who have held Manhattan Associates shares since prior to October 22, 2024, are encourage to visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/manh-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

A recently filed securities class action complaint alleges that, Treace Medical Concepts, Inc. (NASDAQ: TMCI), via certain of its officers, made materially false and/or misleading statements and failed to disclose adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the Complaint alleges Defendants failed to disclose that: (1) competition impacted the demand for and utilization of its primary product, the Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System; (2) as a result, Treace Medical’s revenue declined, and the Company needed to accelerate its plans to offer a product that served as an alternative to osteotomy (a surgical procedure involving the cutting and realignment of a bone to improve its position or function); and (3) Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump’s accusations

Full Content:
Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I’ve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America’s worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America’s best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to “stay strong, keep calm and carry on.” “I testified in Congress before I was CEO,” he says, “and was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‘there’s no way you should be CEO of this company.’ He didn’t think our company was any good or I was any good.” Flash forward a few years and that person was “a good colleague” on other issues. “I don’t hold grudges” quips Moynihan, “except as an Irish person for 100 years.” Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100—which he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. “You need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,” he says. “Some people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.” As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? “What you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you’re in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.” That’s a quality he hires for, too: “You’re looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,” he says. “When 210,000 team members look at you, they don’t want to see a person who’s going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can’t give energy.” You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com NATO on edge for Trump visit The president is in The Hague today for a top-level NATO meeting at which the military alliance is expected to confirm big increases in defense spending. On the way to the Netherlands, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.’s commitment to Article 5, the part of the NATO treaty that says if one member is attacked, all members must respond. “Depends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Trump shares DM from NATO chief The president also posted on social media an obsequious personal message from NATO chief Mark Rutte welcoming him to the meeting. It calls Trump “truly extraordinary” and says “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.” Read it here. Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were “obliterated.” Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding. Judge rules against Jony Ive and Sam Altman A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Ive and Altman’s io AI device venture, according to the FT. OpenAI was forced to take down a blog post announcing their deal because it may infringe upon a trademark established by iyO, a startup founded by Jason Rugolo, who is also pursuing a wearable AI device. Landmark AI copyright decision A U.S. District Judge has ruled that it was “fair use” for AI company Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted books. That is, as long as Anthropic purchased those books and didn’t pirate them. Powell talks to Congress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday that interest rates haven’t been lowered yet because the Fed predicts a “meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.” Powell notably declined to comment on President Trump’s policies during the Congressional hearing.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. It looks like the Xbox team is facing yet another round of cuts. By Eddie Makuch on June 24, 2025 at 8:14AM PDT Microsoft's Xbox division is facing more layoffs soon. That's according to a report from Bloomberg, which said "major" layoffs at Xbox could be announced next week. This would be just the latest round of cuts at Xbox, following 1,900+ layoffs after the Activision Blizzard deal closed and hundreds more job reductions after that. These cuts, and the ones reportedly planned to be announced next week, are believed to be part of a wider cost-cutting program at Microsoft that has resulted in many thousands of layoffs over the past two years. Tom Warren of The Verge reported earlier this month that Xbox would face more layoffs at the end of June. The timing is seemingly not random, as Microsoft's current fiscal year ends on June 30. Today, The Verge reported, citing a source, that "Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, resulting in some Xbox operations ceasing in some regions." A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment when approach by Bloomberg. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft as well in an attempt to get more details. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously said the company needed to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business. Xbox president Sarah Bond gave an answer many were not pleased with as well regarding the job cuts. Some of Microsoft's new moves in gaming recently have included expanding to branded handheld devices and a new Xbox Meta Quest VR headset. 2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft has big plans. Microsoft's reported latest round of layoffs comes amid profitable times for the company. For Microsoft's latest quarter, the company reported net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division specifically has posted year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft's stock price is up by nearly 150% in the past five years. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Debris flows represent a persistent challenge for disaster prediction in mountainous regions due to their highly nonlinear and multivariate triggering mechanisms. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm-Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-Attention (IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention) model, for precise debris flow hazard prediction in the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin, China. The model is developed and validated using data from 159 debris flow-prone gullies, integrating deep convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures, with hyperparameters autonomously optimized by IKOA. Model explainability is enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which quantify the influence of key factors. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework consistently outperforms 13 benchmark models, achieving a root mean square error of 2.33 × 10−6, mean absolute error of 1.51 × 10−6, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.006%. The model maintains high stability across 50 repeated experiments, strong resilience to 20% input noise, and robust generalizability under five-fold cross-validation. Interpretability analysis identifies potential source energy and maximum 24-hour rainfall as primary determinants and uncovers a dual-threshold physical mechanism underlying debris flow initiation. These findings provide a quantitative basis for adaptive early warning and targeted risk mitigation, and establish a transferable framework for explainable geohazard prediction.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Debris flows constitute a catastrophic geophysical phenomenon that epitomizes the complex interplay between gravitational forces, material rheology, and hydrological dynamics in mountainous environments. These rapid mass movements pose an escalating threat to human settlements, critical infrastructure, and ecological integrity globally, with disproportionate impacts on developing regions with expanding mountain populations [1]. The socioeconomic burden is substantial: between 2000 and 2020, debris flows accounted for approximately 17% of global landslide-related fatalities while generating annual economic losses exceeding 20 billion USD. Unlike other natural hazards with extended warning periods, debris flows manifest with minimal antecedent indicators and propagate at velocities reaching 10 m/s, severely constraining evacuation timeframes and necessitating high-precision predictive frameworks for effective risk reduction [2]. The multifactorial triggering mechanisms underlying these events, characterized by nonlinear threshold responses and complex factor interactions, present formidable challenges for contemporary hazard forecasting. The epistemological evolution of debris flow prediction has traversed distinct methodological paradigms, each characterized by specific conceptual frameworks and analytical limitations. Initial approaches relied on empirical correlations derived from historical event databases, establishing phenomenological relationships for inundation area delineation [3] and precipitation threshold determination [4]. Such frameworks, while operationally accessible, frequently exhibited limited transferability beyond their calibration domains. Subsequent advances introduced physically-based numerical models that simulated the complete process chain from material mobilization through deposition, incorporating rheological principles and granular flow mechanics [5]. These sophisticated simulations demonstrably enhanced impact assessment capabilities [6] and runout predictions in topographically complex terrain. Nevertheless, their widespread implementation remains constrained by intensive parameterization requirements, computational demands, and fundamental uncertainties in constitutive relationships governing material behavior during extreme mobilization events. Intermediate methodological frameworks emerged to address these epistemological limitations through probabilistic formulations and multi-criteria decision architectures. Statistical models employing Bayesian inference frameworks quantified conditional hazard probabilities under varying environmental scenarios, enabling the establishment of robust rainfall thresholds with explicit uncertainty quantification [7]. Concurrently, multi-attribute decision frameworks provided structured methodologies for integrating heterogeneous hazard factors [8], with recent innovations applying Analytic Hierarchy Process techniques to susceptibility mapping across diverse geological contexts [9] and multi-criteria analysis approaches to flood risk assessment in coastal regions [10]. Despite their theoretical elegance, these approaches frequently encounter fundamental constraints in high-dimensional feature space integration and often introduce systematic biases through subjective parameter weighting schemes that compromise prediction reliability. The integration of machine learning (ML) into geohazard assessment represents a paradigmatic transformation in debris flow prediction, facilitating the identification of complex, nonlinear patterns within high-dimensional environmental datasets that remain inaccessible to conventional analytical approaches [11]. Contemporary research has demonstrated the efficacy of artificial neural networks in characterizing rainfall-triggered debris flow probability distributions and advanced information-theoretic coupling methods for susceptibility assessment [12]. These computational frameworks excel in capturing intricate multivariate relationships without requiring explicit physical process formulation [13]. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques enhance predictive stability and generalization capabilities across heterogeneous environmental conditions previously inaccessible to traditional modeling frameworks. Despite their transformative potential, current ML applications to debris flow hazard assessment exhibit critical epistemological and methodological limitations that constrain their scientific impact and operational utility. First, model performance demonstrates an acute sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, with suboptimal parameterization inducing overfitting phenomena that compromise generalization to novel geomorphological contexts [14]. Second, conventional optimization algorithms frequently converge prematurely to local extrema, resulting in suboptimal exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space [15]. Third, and most fundamentally, deep learning architectures manifest intrinsic opacity that creates a profound disconnect between predictive capacity and mechanistic understanding [16]. This explainability deficit, frequently characterized as the “black-box problem,” represents a critical epistemological barrier in hazard forecasting applications. The black-box problem specifically refers to the inherent inability to trace how deep learning models transform input features into output predictions through their complex internal architectures. This opacity manifests through (1) algorithmic complexity, where numerous interconnected neurons and non-linear activation functions obscure input-output relationships; (2) latent feature representation, where models develop abstract internal representations that lack direct physical interpretation; and (3) stochastic learning behavior, where training procedures yield models whose internal configurations cannot be deterministically predicted. Contemporary neural networks, while achieving unprecedented predictive accuracy, typically obscure the contribution of specific variables to prediction outcomes, thereby inhibiting scientific elucidation of causative mechanisms and undermining the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies. Three fundamental research gaps persist in contemporary literature that motivate this study: (1) the predominant prioritization of predictive accuracy over model explainability creates an artificial tension between computational performance and theoretical advancement; (2) current methodological frameworks overwhelmingly employ single-algorithm approaches that inadequately capture the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering conditions; and (3) the systematic integration of advanced optimization techniques with explainable artificial intelligence frameworks remains largely unexplored in geohazard prediction contexts, particularly for multi-parameter debris flow risk assessment. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, particularly the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach, offer promising solutions to these challenges by providing mathematically rigorous attribution mechanisms derived from cooperative game theory principles [17,18]. Despite preliminary applications identifying dominant controlling factors in debris flow research, comprehensive XAI integration within holistic debris flow assessment frameworks remains substantially underdeveloped [19]. Motivated by these research gaps and the potential of XAI approaches, this study aims to develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework that maximizes both predictive accuracy and scientific explainability for debris flow hazard assessment. The specific research objectives include: (1) identifying optimal architectural configurations for capturing complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering factors; (2) quantifying the relative contribution of environmental, geological, and meteorological variables; (3) establishing a theoretical framework connecting physical processes to prediction outcomes through explainable AI; and (4) determining quantitative thresholds governing debris flow risk to support evidence-based intervention strategies. To address these objectives, this study implements an IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework that integrates physics-inspired optimization algorithms with deep learning architectures and explainability mechanisms. This framework combines convolutional networks for spatial feature extraction, bidirectional recurrent units for temporal dynamics modeling, and attention mechanisms for feature importance weighting, specifically designed to capture debris flow triggering mechanisms while providing SHAP-based scientific insights. The framework advances debris flow hazard prediction methodologically, theoretically, analytically, and practically, offering actionable insights for precision disaster risk management. The overall workflow of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g001 Precise determination of influencing factor weights constitutes a fundamental challenge in debris flow hazard assessment. This study proposes a novel game theory-based comprehensive weighting framework that integrates three complementary methodologies: the coefficient of variation method (CVM), entropy weight method (EWM), and CRITIC method [20–22]. Each methodology captures distinct aspects of factor importance: data dispersion, information entropy, and inter-factor correlations, respectively. The proposed framework applies cooperative game theory principles to optimize the collective strengths of these methods, conceptualizing each as a strategic element in a cooperative game to determine optimal weight distribution. The complete framework is illustrated in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g002 The Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA), introduced by Mohamed Abdel-Basset in 2023, serves as the foundation for model optimization in this study. KOA represents a physics-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion [23]. This algorithm conceptualizes the Sun as the optimal solution and planets as candidate solutions, with planetary motion mechanisms driving the evaluation of solution quality. Compared to established optimization algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), KOA exhibits enhanced exploration capabilities within the solution space through innovative search strategies, enabling effective avoidance of local optima entrapment while ensuring stability and robustness in hyperparameter optimization for complex models. From a mathematical perspective, KOA operates through seven sequential steps: Step 1: Initialization process. The algorithm begins with a random generation of candidate solutions representing planets moving within the search space. Each planet possesses a position and velocity representing potential optimization solutions. Each planetary position is formally defined as shown in Equation (1). In Equation (1), Xi represents the ith candidate solution in the model; d represents the number of dimensions; N indicates the number of candidate solutions; Xji,up and Xji,low determine the boundary range of the search space, with rand[0,1] randomly selected values between and . The eccentricity ei and period Ti are initialized according to Equations (2) and (3). In Equations (2) – (3), r is a random number based on a normal distribution. Step 2: Defining the gravitational force (F). Planets experience varying velocities at different orbital positions due to differential gravitational pull from the Sun along elliptical planetary orbits. The gravitational force experienced by a planet is formulated as in Equation (4), while the Euclidean distance is represented in Equation (5). Step 3: Calculating object velocity. Based on gravitational force and Sun-planet distance, the velocity of a planet at any position on its elliptical orbit is expressed as Equation (6). Step 4: Escaping from local optima. The parameter π in the velocity equation modulates search direction, simulating varying orbital directions of planets within the Solar System. This mechanism prevents convergence on local optima, as shown in Equation (7). Step 5: Updating object positions. Planetary motion occurs in two distinct phases: approaching and receding from the Sun. These correspond to the exploitation and exploration phases respectively. During exploration, the algorithm discovers new candidate solutions. During exploitation, solutions near the optimum are refined, as shown in Equation (8). Step 6: Updating Sun-planet distance. Manipulation of parameter h enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, as shown in Equation (9). Step 7: Elitism mechanism. The algorithm evaluates fitness values between current and newly calculated positions, retaining superior solutions while discarding inferior ones, as shown in Equation (10). Despite the promising capabilities of physics-inspired metaheuristics, optimization algorithms frequently encounter fundamental challenges including premature convergence, local optima entrapment, and suboptimal exploration-exploitation balance. To overcome these intrinsic limitations in the standard KOA framework, this study proposes a systematically enhanced variant, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm (IKOA), incorporating three complementary methodological refinements: (1) Chebyshev mapping for ergodic population initialization, (2) golden sine operator for solution space adaptation, and (3) dynamic weight coefficient for balanced search dynamics. This integrative approach ensures exceptional parameter optimization robustness across complex hypersurfaces. The complete algorithmic architecture is illustrated in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g003 Chaos mapping represents an uncertain and random methodology within nonlinear dynamic systems. In the process of initializing position updates, chaotic variables replace the random variables traditionally used in intelligent algorithm processes, thereby offering a broader search range in the solution space compared to probability-based random search strategies. Consequently, employing chaos mapping for population initialization in the KOA enhances the diversity of the population and the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm. This study utilizes the Chebyshev chaos mapping method [24], with its mathematical description presented in Equation (11), where k denotes the order. The Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA), proposed by Tanyildizi et al., is a novel metaheuristic algorithm [25]. Gold-SA differs from swarm intelligence algorithms by focusing on enhancing search efficiency and optimization precision in the later stages through the gradual narrowing of the current solution space. This means that the current search space continuously converges towards the optimal target value. In the traditional KOA algorithm, the efficiency of local and global searches by planetary individuals is relatively low, making the algorithm more susceptible to becoming trapped in local optima as it progresses. By incorporating the golden sine operator into Step 5, and leveraging the properties of the golden ratio coefficient to reduce the solution space, the overall performance of the algorithm is significantly improved. The position update formula with the added golden sine operator is presented in Equation (12). In Equation (15), R1∈[0, 2π]is a random number determining the distance of the individual’s movement in the next iteration, R2∈[0, π] is a random number determining the direction of the next movement, and x1 = -π+(1-π)*2π, x2 = -π + τ*2πare coefficients derived from the golden section ratio τ=(-1)/2, This ratio narrows the algorithm’s search space and guides individuals gradually towards the optimum. To address the issue of insufficient global exploration capability during the position updates for planets close to the Sun in Step 6, a dynamic weight coefficient based on the number of iterations is introduced in Equation (9). This addition provides a balanced capability for global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm, as detailed in the improved formula shown in Equation (13). In Equation (13), k1 = 1-t3/T3, k2 = t3/T3. Within Equation (13), k1 is larger in the early stages of iteration, enhancing the planets’ early exploration ability, while k2 gradually increases in the later stages, ensuring the planets’ local exploitation capability in the latter phase. To evaluate IKOA’s optimization capabilities, this study implemented a benchmark analysis using nine standard test functions from the CEC 2005 benchmark suite [26]. These functions provide standardized performance metrics across multiple dimensions: unimodal functions f1-f5 assess local exploitation efficiency; multimodal functions f6-f7 examine global exploration capabilities; and fixed-dimension multimodal functions f8-f9 evaluate performance in complex search spaces. Table 1 presents the mathematical formulations and characteristics of each function. Experimental dimensionality was set at 30 for functions f1-f7 and 2 for functions f8-f9, following standard protocols. The comparative analysis included IKOA, original KOA, and three contemporary algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) [27–29]. Each function underwent 30 independent optimization trials, with convergence trajectories illustrated in Fig 4. The analysis demonstrates IKOA’s superior performance across optimization metrics. IKOA consistently exhibits accelerated convergence compared to reference algorithms, achieving superior early-stage exploration and late-stage exploitation precision while maintaining an exceptional balance between search diversification and intensification. These qualities establish IKOA’s theoretical foundation for application in debris flow hazard assessment modeling, where its enhanced optimization capabilities directly translate to improved predictive performance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g004 This study presents a novel hierarchical deep learning architecture for debris flow hazard assessment that integrates optimization algorithms with specialized neural network components. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework, illustrated in Fig 5, implements a cascaded processing pipeline for multidimensional geophysical data. The CNN module [30] employs convolutional operations to extract spatially invariant features across multiple abstraction levels, identifying complex topographical signatures that serve as precursors to debris flow events. The BiGRU component [31] extends representation capacity through bidirectional recurrent processing, capturing non-linear dependencies in sequential geophysical processes by propagating information in forward and reverse temporal directions. The Attention mechanism [32] implements adaptive computational focus through learned importance weighting, dynamically modulating feature contributions based on contextual relevance. A distinctive contribution is the meta-optimization approach implemented through IKOA, which systematically refines four foundational hyperparameters: Learning Rate, GRU Units m, CNN Filters n, and Batch Size b. These parameters critically influence model performance, balancing expressiveness, computational efficiency, and generalization capability. The implementation proceeds through four systematic phases: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g005 Step 1: Data Preprocessing. Statistical standardization establishes numerical stability while K-Nearest Neighbors imputation preserves data integrity through the reconstruction of missing values. Step 2: Model Initialization. The preprocessed dataset undergoes chronological partitioning with 70% allocated for parameter estimation and feature learning. Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization. IKOA explores the hyperparameter space to identify optimal architectural configurations through iterative performance evaluation. Step 4: Model Deployment. The optimized architecture is applied to the remaining 30% for validation and hazard prediction generation. The study area encompasses the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin in China (Fig 6), spanning approximately 33,500 km2 and constituting 8.7% of Yunnan Province’s total area. This geographically significant region extends 650 km along the Nujiang (Salween) River, bordered by the Lancang River Basin to the east and Myanmar to the west, spanning from the southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau to the northern extent of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The study area is situated between 24°07’ to 28°23’ N latitude and 98°07’ to 100°00’ E longitude. The geomorphology exhibits extreme topographic heterogeneity characterized by dramatic alpine gorges and precipitous mountainous terrain. The landscape features a pronounced north-south elevation gradient, intersected by the Hengduan Mountain Range. The area contains one of the most significant geomorphological features in the region, the Nujiang Grand Canyon, which ranks among the world’s deepest canyon systems. This exceptional topographic amplitude creates optimal conditions for gravitational mass movements, particularly debris flows with substantial kinetic energy and destructive potential. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g006 The region’s climate is classified as humid subtropical monsoon, characterized by abundant yet spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Annual rainfall demonstrates significant variability, with maximum precipitation reaching approximately 1500 mm in higher elevation zones and diminishing to below 1000 mm in lower elevation areas. Temporal distribution exhibits marked seasonality, with over 51% of annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoon period [27]. This concentrated rainfall pattern constitutes the primary triggering mechanism for debris flow mobilization. The geological framework displays exceptional complexity, dominated by metamorphic complexes and sedimentary formations intersected by numerous fault systems. This intricate structural geology, combined with intense neotectonic activity, has produced extensive zones of fractured and weathered lithological material that serves as source material for debris flows. The synergistic interaction between fractured bedrock, steep topographic gradients, and concentrated seasonal precipitation creates ideal conditions for debris flow initiation and propagation. These distinctive geoenvironmental characteristics contribute to the elevated frequency and magnitude of geohazard events throughout the region. The prevalence of these hazards necessitates systematic investigation for effective disaster risk reduction strategies and sustainable regional development initiatives. This research utilizes comprehensive data from 159 debris flow prone gullies distributed throughout the Nujiang River Basin, applying advanced deep learning methodologies to analyze and predict debris flow hazard intensities across diverse geomorphological contexts. Elevation data are based on SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, NASA/USGS). Administrative boundaries and rivers are from Natural Earth (public domain). Map generated by the authors. This investigation established a comprehensive parametric foundation for debris flow susceptibility analysis through systematic integration of multidisciplinary data sources, including extensive literature synthesis [28], satellite remote sensing explanation, field-based geomorphological investigations, and archival geological and hydrological documentation. Advanced geospatial technologies facilitated rigorous extraction of topographical variables from 30m-resolution SRTM DEM data, while meteorological parameters underwent spatial interpolation through geostatistical inverse distance weighting algorithms calibrated with observational data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the study domain. The extracted factors for the study area include: maximum 24-hour rainfall (X1), annual average rainfall (X2), annual average temperature (X3), annual average wind speed (X4), annual average vapor pressure (X5), annual average relative humidity (X6), potential source energy (X7), catchment area (X8), average gradient of the main channel (X9), length ratio of the sediment supply section (X10), length of the main channel (X11), sinuosity of the main channel (X12), drainage density of the catchment (X13), valley profile roundness (X14), vegetation cover rate (X15), average slope (X16), maximum relative elevation difference within the catchment (X17), lithological impact (X18), and dynamic storage capacity (X19). A total of 19 factors were selected, sequentially numbered as X1 to X19. In line with the principles of systematicity, completeness, effectiveness, and comparability in the selection of evaluation indicators, and considering the accessibility and operability of the data, the debris flow outbreak system in the study area was divided into three subsystems: the hydrometeorological subsystem, material source subsystem, and geographic subsystem, encompassing the aforementioned 19 factors (X1-X19). The rationale for selecting each factor is detailed in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t002 Statistical independence among predictor variables constitutes a critical prerequisite for robust hazard modeling. The research implemented Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to systematically diagnose multicollinearity and optimize variable selection. VIF quantifies variance inflation of regression coefficients due to linear dependencies, calculated as 1/(1-R2), where R2 represents the coefficient when regressing a variable against all other predictors. While conventional guidelines suggest a VIF threshold of 10, the current investigation adopted a more conservative threshold of 5 to ensure model stability and parameter precision for complex environmental systems [51]. Multicollinearity diagnosis identified four factors exceeding this threshold: X10 (length ratio of the sediment supply section: 7.83), X14 (valley profile roundness: 5.62), X17 (maximum relative elevation difference: 8.14), and X19 (dynamic storage capacity: 6.95). These variables were systematically excluded to maximize model precision. Fig 7 presents the VIF analysis results for all hazard-causing factors, illustrating that the final variable selection optimizes unique information content while minimizing statistical redundancy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g007 The inherent complexity of debris flow systems necessitates sophisticated factor weighting approaches that accommodate the multidimensional interactions among diverse variables. This study implements the game theory-based comprehensive weighting methodology detailed in section 2.1, achieving optimal integration of complementary weighting perspectives. The resulting factor weights derived from this approach are presented in Fig 8. The hazard level assessment procedure follows a systematic framework: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g008 Step 1: Normalize the original dataset to eliminate the dimensional impact of different factors. The normalization formulas for maximum-type indicators and minimum-type indicators are shown in Equations (14) and (15), respectively. In Equations (14) – (15), xij represents the jth influencing factor of the ith gully, i = 1,2,…,n and j = 1,2,…,m, n denotes the number of data groups, and m denotes the number of factors. Step 2: For each debris flow gully, sum the weighted data of influencing factors to obtain its hazard assessment value. The calculation formula is shown in Equation (16). In Equation (16), wj represents the weight of each factor through Fig 8, and rij denotes the normalized value of the jth influencing factor for the ith gully. To ensure statistical robustness, experimental parameters were standardized with population size fixed at 30 and iteration count at 100 across all optimization algorithms. The dataset underwent a 70%/30% training-testing partition, with results averaged across 50 independent runs. Notably, 12 test samples with distinctive geomorphological characteristics were deliberately included to evaluate model generalization capabilities across diverse debris flow conditions. Performance evaluation employed three complementary metrics: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The proposed IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy when benchmarked against 13 established machine learning regression models [52–55], as quantified in Table 3. Performance comparisons among the top five models are visualized in Fig 9. The hybrid model achieved unprecedented prediction precision with RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6, MAE of 1.51 × 10−6, and MAPE of 0.006%, representing multiple orders of magnitude improvement over conventional approaches. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g009 This superior performance reflects systematic hyperparameter optimization through the improved Krill Herd algorithm. The learning rate underwent progressive refinement from 0.0061 to 0.0014, while GRU units converged to 116, CNN filters stabilized at 54, and batch size optimized at 31. The hyperparameter evolution across iterations, detailed in Table 4, demonstrates the algorithm’s capacity to navigate complex parameter spaces while avoiding local optima. Architecturally, the bidirectional GRU component captures temporal dependencies in multidimensional feature sequences, while the attention mechanism adaptively prioritizes critical factors including slope characteristics, precipitation parameters, and drainage properties. Unlike models such as GWO-ELM and PSO-SVM, which exhibit performance degradation with geomorphologically distinct test cases, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model maintains exceptional prediction stability across diverse geological contexts, validating its effectiveness in modeling the inherently nonlinear and multidimensional nature of debris flow hazard systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t004 Through systematic application of SHAP methodology, this study deconstructs the internal decision processes of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, revealing that the architecture captures both physical threshold effects and multifactorial regulatory relationships governing debris flow initiation. Fig 10(a) presents a quantitative hierarchical ranking of feature importance wherein potential source energy X7 emerges as the predominant factor with a mean absolute SHAP value of 1.07 × 10−2, approximately 4.6-fold greater than the second-ranked parameter. Annual mean temperature X3, annual mean vapor pressure X5, and average slope X16 constitute the second tier of importance, while annual mean rainfall X2, vegetation coverage X15, and main channel length X11 form a distinct third tier. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g010 Fig 10(b) elucidates the dependency relationship between potential source energy X7 and its corresponding SHAP values, demonstrating a threshold effect in debris flow triggering mechanisms. The relationship manifests as a sigmoidal nonlinear curve, optimally fitted by the cubic function y = 1.25 × 10-4x3 - 9.37 × 10-4x2 + 1.83 × 10-2x − 2.21 × 10−2 with an R2 value of 0.98. A critical inflection point is identified at X7 ≈ 3.12 × 109 J/m2, effectively partitioning the risk domain into two distinct regions: a low-risk zone where X7 < 3.12 × 109 J/m2 and a high-risk zone where X7 > 3.12 × 109 J/m2. Within the low-risk zone, SHAP values consistently approximate zero or exhibit slightly negative values, indicating insufficient energy accumulation for debris flow mobilization; within the high-risk zone, SHAP values demonstrate an accelerating positive trend as X7 increases, reflecting the nonlinear amplification characteristic of debris flow initiation. The SHAP value distribution in Fig 10(c) further illuminates the distinct influence patterns of various factors on model predictions. The distribution for X7 exhibits pronounced bimodal segregation: low-value samples cluster tightly around the zero SHAP value region, while high-value samples display substantial positive shifts, reaching SHAP values exceeding 0.2, surpassing the influence range of all other features. This polarized distribution provides statistical confirmation of the threshold phenomenon. High values of maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and annual mean relative humidity X6 similarly exhibit positive SHAP value tendencies, albeit with considerably greater dispersion, indicating that these parameters function as conditional triggers whose efficacy is contingent upon the antecedent state of source energy accumulation. Based on the comprehensive SHAP analysis, a physically explainable mechanistic framework for debris flow formation emerges: potential source energy X7 constitutes the fundamental prerequisite condition with a quantified threshold of 3.12 × 109 J/m2; environmental parameters such as annual mean temperature X3 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 function as regulatory modulators, exerting indirect effects by altering source material stability; hydrological factors, primarily maximum 24-hour rainfall X1, operate as activation triggers that initiate debris flow mobilization only when the prerequisite energy threshold condition has been satisfied. Building upon the identification of potential source energy X7 as the dominant factor, this section systematically explores factor interactions and their impact on debris flow risk prediction, revealing complex relationships with implications for monitoring and early warning systems optimization. Fig 11 illustrates the interaction effects between source energy and key environmental variables. The interaction between X7 and annual mean temperature X3 reveals a significant correlation r = 0.06, p < 0.05, with risk contribution substantially increasing when the temperature exceeds 16°C in high source energy areas. This temperature-energy interaction suggests that thermal conditions may accelerate material destabilization processes in areas with significant loose material accumulation. The practical implication for disaster prevention is that temperature monitoring should be integrated into early warning systems, particularly for regions with high material accumulation. Warning thresholds may require seasonal adjustments with heightened vigilance during warmer periods when temperatures exceed 16°C. Similarly, the interaction between X7 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 demonstrates a stronger correlation r = 0.19, p < 0.01, with high X7 samples manifesting significantly elevated SHAP values when X5 exceeds 15 hPa. This finding indicates that humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks alongside traditional rainfall gauges, particularly in areas with substantial loose material accumulation, as atmospheric moisture conditions appear to play an important role in destabilizing source materials. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g011 The interaction between maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and X7 provides particularly valuable insights for risk management. Despite statistical non-significance in overall correlation r = 0.02, p > 0.05, clear nonlinear patterns emerge: rainfall intensity substantially impacts risk only when source energy exceeds approximately 5 × 109 J/m2, while having minimal effect below this threshold. This conditional relationship fundamentally challenges the conventional rainfall-threshold approach to debris flow warning. For early warning system design, this finding suggests implementing a hierarchical approach where areas are first classified by source energy potential, with advanced rainfall monitoring prioritized specifically in high-energy zones. For low-energy zones, basic rainfall monitoring may be sufficient regardless of precipitation intensity. Rainfall thresholds should be dynamic rather than fixed, adjusting based on source material conditions. Fig 12 refines the threshold identification through a detailed SHAP response analysis. The upper panel presents a higher-order polynomial analysis of the X7 SHAP response curve with R2 = 0.99, identifying a critical inflection point at X7 = 3.00 × 109 J/m2. This value provides a quantitative criterion for classifying terrain vulnerability in hazard mapping exercises and prioritizing areas for source material control measures such as check dams, retaining walls, and slope stabilization projects. The upper right panel identifies a distinct inflection point in the X1 SHAP dependency curve at X1 = 27.01 mm, providing a data-driven basis for rainfall warning standards. This specific threshold offers a quantitative reference for evaluating and potentially adjusting current warning thresholds in operational early warning systems. The lower panel integrates these insights into a comprehensive two-dimensional risk contour map with three distinct risk domains that translate directly to operational warning levels. The blue region represents normal conditions where predicted risk values fall below 0.03, warranting routine monitoring procedures. The yellow zone indicates heightened alert conditions with predicted risk values between 0.03 and 0.20, necessitating increased monitoring frequency and preliminary emergency preparations. The red domain signifies emergency response conditions where the predicted risk exceeds 0.20, requiring immediate protective actions including potential evacuations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g012 Fig 13 extends this analysis into three dimensions, revealing a comprehensive risk response surface that captures the compound effects of X7 and X1. The visualization of threshold planes creates four distinct quadrants that translate to operational intervention priority zones. The first quadrant, characterized by values below both X7 and X1 thresholds, indicates low-priority zones warranting only basic monitoring. The second quadrant, where X7 exceeds its threshold while X1 remains below its critical value, demarcates source-control priority zones where engineering measures to reduce material accumulation should be emphasized. The third quadrant, characterized by X1 values above the threshold while X7 remains below its critical level, identifies hydrological management priority zones where drainage improvements and runoff control should be prioritized. The fourth quadrant, where both X7 and X1 exceed their respective thresholds, delineates comprehensive intervention zones requiring integrated approaches combining multiple strategies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g013 Building on identified risk factors and thresholds, this section evaluates the comparative efficacy of different risk reduction approaches, providing quantitative insights for evidence-based disaster management decision-making. Figs 14(a) and 14(b) present comparative risk response curves for interventions targeting X7 and X1, respectively. The analysis reveals that reducing maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 from 29.5 mm to 27.0 mm yields a 58.8% risk reduction, while reducing potential source energy X7 from 8.0 × 109 J/m2 to 3.0 × 109 J/m2 achieves a 25.0% risk diminution. This substantial difference in intervention efficacy provides clear guidance for resource allocation: rainfall control measures may yield faster risk reduction returns compared to source control measures. Figs 14(c) and 14(d) further refine this analysis through spatially-resolved risk reduction percentage contour maps, revealing that vulnerability mapping should identify transition zones where risk factors are marginally above threshold values, as modest interventions in these areas may yield substantial risk reduction. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g014 Fig 15 presents SHAP force plots from representative data points selected through stratified random sampling, revealing substantial heterogeneity in localized risk factor compositions. This heterogeneity indicates that effective risk management requires location-specific approaches tailored to the dominant local risk factors. For implementation, this suggests customizing monitoring systems based on local risk factor compositions. Locations dominated by meteorological factors would benefit from enhanced weather-based warning systems with meteorological monitoring, while areas where topographical factors predominate would likely respond better to physical infrastructure interventions rather than precipitation-based warning systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g015 Synthesizing these analytical results, a practical framework for precision debris flow risk management emerges with several actionable components. Early warning systems should implement rainfall thresholds that adjust based on source energy conditions rather than universal rainfall values, with lower rainfall thresholds applied in high source energy areas and higher thresholds in low energy areas. Beyond traditional rainfall monitoring, temperature and humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks, especially in areas where source energy exceeds the identified threshold. In resource-constrained environments, interventions should be sequenced according to threshold proximity, prioritizing areas just above threshold values where modest investments yield substantial risk reduction. Different zones require specific approaches: high-source energy zones warrant engineering interventions to reduce source material accumulation; critical rainfall zones require drainage improvements and runoff control; dual-threshold exceedance zones necessitate comprehensive management strategies incorporating both engineering measures and enhanced monitoring systems. Warning thresholds and monitoring intensity should be adjusted seasonally where temperature appears as a significant risk modifier, with heightened vigilance during periods exceeding 16°C. While the specific threshold values identified in this study are calibrated to the study area’s geological and climatological context, the methodological framework for threshold identification and factor interaction analysis remains transferable across diverse geographical settings, allowing regional calibration of specific thresholds while maintaining the structural integrity of the factor interaction paradigm. The stability of a model is crucial for reliable debris flow hazard prediction, as it ensures consistent results across multiple independent runs. To evaluate the stability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, 50 independent experiments were conducted, recording the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their standard deviations (SD). Lower SD values indicate higher stability and consistency in predictions. As shown in Table 5 the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated minimal performance fluctuations, with an RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6 ± 1.51 × 10−7 and an MAE of 1.51 × 10−6 ± 1.10 × 10−7, outperforming all comparative models. These results highlight the model’s reliability and reproducibility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in debris flow hazard prediction. Its stable performance improves the credibility of risk assessments and provides robust technical support for disaster prevention and mitigation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t005 Robustness is essential for ensuring a model’s reliability when handling data disturbances such as noise or outliers, which are common in real-world geological and meteorological datasets. To evaluate the robustness of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, random noise levels of 5%, 10%, and 20% were added to the test dataset to simulate possible data disturbances. The changes in performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were observed to determine the model’s ability to handle noisy data. As shown in Table 6, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model showed minimal performance degradation. When the noise level increased from 0% to 20%, the RMSE rose by only 7.9 × 10−7, and the MAE increased by approximately 4.9 × 10−7. Compared to other models, these slight increases demonstrate the strong robustness of the proposed model, which ensures high predictive accuracy even under noisy data conditions. This robustness confirms the model’s reliability in complex environments and enhances its applicability to practical disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t006 The applicability of a model is crucial for assessing its practical value, particularly its suitability across different regions and datasets. To evaluate the applicability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, a 5-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were recorded for each fold to assess performance consistency. As shown in the results in Table 7, the RMSE ranged from 2.35 × 10−6 to 2.50 × 10−6, and the MAE ranged from 1.55 × 10−6 to 1.65 × 10−6, with minimal fluctuations across the folds. This consistent performance demonstrates the model’s strong applicability and stability, making it suitable for predicting debris flow hazards not only in the specific study area but also in other geographical regions. Its generalizability provides robust technical support for global disaster risk assessment and early warning efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t007 This study proposes an integrated IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework with SHAP explainability for high-precision debris flow hazard prediction that combines advanced optimization techniques, multidimensional deep learning architectures, and explainable AI mechanisms. Through systematic implementation and validation in the Nujiang River Basin, China, the study yields five principal contributions: The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Information Technology Center, Zhejiang University.

Title: Meta’s Quest 3S Xbox Edition Is a Great Value, but There’s Just One Big Tradeoff

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoftâs wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S’ displays don’t offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience. Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesnât let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft’s streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain. Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming. Pros Cons Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it’s less effective for game streaming. I’ve become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it’s what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on whatâs normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, thereâs a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best. The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the QuestÂ 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you’re directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It’s not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying. While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920×1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you’ll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I’m already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing. If you donât own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strapâwhich offers better comfort than the default headbandânormally retails for $70. The controllerâs suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you’ll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streamingâwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titlesâyou wonât have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store donât take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option. Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a âgamer device,” enough that it shouldnât stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt. Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole âfamilyâ of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That canât be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the companyâs own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, weâll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

Title: A cease-fire between Israel and Iran hangs in the balance. The markets are holding their nerve.

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London. A former animation president at Warner Bros. and Comcast's DreamWorks is betting he can create the next Hollywood franchises with the help of AI — and just raised $11.6 million to do it. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump announced a cease-fire between Iran and Israel. Israel says Iran has violated it. We're looking at how the markets are reacting — and what they're expecting next. What's on deck Markets: Real-estate investors are no longer counting out San Francisco. Tech: Leaked files and the startup's own contractors are calling Scale AI's security into question. Business: Why we should all know less about each other at work. But first, the markets are hopeful. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "Please do not violate it!" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post earlier this morning. He was referring to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, which Trump said was "now in effect." It was the news the markets had been waiting for. European and US stock-index futures both jumped, while the dollar fell against all its major peers and gold, a safe haven asset, dropped 1.3%. Oil prices, meanwhile, continued their plunge. Hours later, Israel's defense minister said Iran had violated the cease-fire — and vowed to respond with "powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran." Iran has denied the accusation. BI is covering this developing story. Follow our coverage. In many cases, the traditional risk-off response would've hampered the early-morning market rally, yet US stock futures are still firmly up. While the latest developments appear to signal a renewed escalation, markets are reacting as if this is a temporary disruption in an otherwise steady move toward de-escalation. We saw a similar thing yesterday, when Iran said it fired missiles at a US military base in Qatar. Fears of supply disruption would normally send oil prices up, but the attack was largely believed to be symbolic — Trump thanked Iran for giving the US "early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost." Oil prices continued to fall. Investors had also been pricing in geopolitical risks for months. "There wasn't much in the way of escalation so markets breathed a sigh of relief," Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI. We might be witnessing a similar scenario play out. A cease-fire hangs in the balance, but amid a cloud of uncertainty, it seems the markets are holding their nerve. 1. Don't get too excited about Tesla's stock jump, UBS says. The EV-maker's stock leapt 11% Monday morning after its robotaxi launch, but UBS said the opportunity is "already priced into the stock" in a note. Tesla's stock has been on a wild ride this year and is still down 13.6% YTD. 2. San Francisco could be in for a real estate rebound. The city is buzzing again thanks to RTO mandates. While the average rent price is still below pre-pandemic levels, they're predicted to tick up. Large investors are aiming to capitalize on a rebound by buying up multi-family homes. 3. The housing market is slowly turning in favor of buyers. A Redfin report showed US home prices rose 0.7% in May, the smallest increase since 2023. They expect this trend to continue and potentially start showing year-on-year declines by the end of 2025. 1. Scale AI's data security problem. The startup, which uses public Google Docs to track internal work for its high-profile clients, has left multiple AI training docs labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with a link, BI has found. While there's no indication that Scale AI's practices have caused a breach, one expert called it "dangerous." 2. Leave a tip? JK! Tesla's robotaxi service trolls users who try to tip their non-human drivers, some commuters discovered shortly after the robotaxi launch in Austin. See what happens when you try. 3. Chatbots are competing for users on WhatsApp. The messaging app, owned by Meta, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," according to Mark Zuckerberg. It's also becoming an AI free-for-all as rival chatbots compete for audiences, which could hurt Meta's quest to become the default AI provider, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Make coworkers mysterious again. It's good that workplaces have become more inviting, but there's a cost to sharing too much. Besides annoying coworkers and managers, oversharing can hurt an employee's reputation and their organization's, writes BI's Emily Stewart. 2. Compass is lawyering up to fight Zillow. The real estate brokerage accused Zillow of violating antitrust laws by forcing listings onto its platform in a lawsuit filed Monday. Zillow has been beefing with big brokerages since they started gatekeeping certain listings, arguing that they're creating an uneven playing field for homebuyers. 3. DTC bedding brand Parachute folds 19 stores. Parachute shrank its retail footprint from 26 to seven storefronts over the past year, becoming the latest direct-to-consumer brand that's struggled to scale or turn a profit. It said it plans to focus on e-commerce and partnerships with retailers like Target instead. New York City primary mayoral election.

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth

Time Published: 2025-06-23T20:51:01Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

Title: Apple might buy Perplexity AI to bolster AI division
URL: https://mobilesyrup.com/2025/06/23/apple-might-buy-perplexity-ai-to-bolster-ai-division/

Apple is still considering its AI moves, and now it seems like the startup Perplexity might be on the menu. A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple is weighing the pros and cons of an acquisition that could help it acquire more AI talent and products. On the flip side, there are reports that Apple might partner with the company instead of buying it. This partnership could lead to an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and integrating the company’s tech into Siri. The report says Apple has made no formal offers, but has met with the company several times lately. This deal and/or partnership is likely spurred by two things. First is the potential for Apple and Google’s deal for search on iPhone to evaporate as U.S. courts look at Google as a monopoly on the search market. Apple is also seen as behind the competition in AI, and a major move like this is bound to be good for the stock price. The Bloomberg report mentions that Google’s stock fell a point after the news went live about Apple’s possible AI acquisition. There’s also some speculation that Sam Altman and OpenAI’s deal with ex-Apple design legend Jony Ive on some AI hardware might be putting pressure on Apple to get into the AI game sooner rather than later. That being said, Apple is working on its own AI tools, so it’s likely a matter of how long it thinks those will take to make and how much the company actually cares about what Wall Street thinks. There is an argument to be made that with Apple’s dominant market share in the iPhone, it can likely afford to be a few years late to the AI game, especially since we’ve seen so many issues with the current crop of generative and search AI tools. However, previous reports said Apple’s top executives are split on AI adoption, so things might be stalling in either direction. The report also mentions that Meta has already made an offer to buy Perplexity, but the companies couldn’t come to an agreement, so Meta invested in Scale AI. Perplexity’s CEO says that Meta even tried to poach them for its ‘Superintelligence’ team. Meta has also approached staff from OpenAI and offered salaries with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta’s investment in Scale was US$14.3 billion, (C$19.6 billion), so it stands to reason that the company offered a similar deal to Perplexity. The AI startup is valued at US$14 billion (C$19 billion) after its last funding round, so I expect it will cost even more if Apple wants to buy the company. The big question I have at this point is, if Apple is considering making big AI moves, will that delay some of the already announced features, like the Siri enhancements we’ve been waiting for since WWDC in 2024?

Title: Coffee Break: Nihilists at Google Wrecking Existing Business to Chase AI Growth
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=294347
Time Published: 2025-06-23T18:00:03Z
Full Content:
In 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that “in the long run, we’re evolving in computing from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.” In 2018, he famously told Kara Swisher that AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj I’ll circle back to ChatGPT and the fundamental reason it is not going to replace Google search. Ed Zitron has demonstrated beyond a doubt that it is not financially viable, not at the free level, not at the premium level. Their last best hope seems to be a turn toward surveillance tech but they’re going up against Palantir and multiple incumbents there. Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” my pleasure as always to post for this wonderful community. And yes, Zitron and Gary Marcus are my go-tos on AI scepticism. Zitron on the business side and Marcus on the tech fundamentals. We are in the midst of the biggest Ponzi scheme in human history. “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! thank you for the kind words and the analysis of AI’s summary of Ahab’s speech. Oh the lulz. Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. thank you NM. It’s entirely possible you’re correct. Google execs just have to be smarter than I’m giving them credit for or its the biggest deliberate destruction of shareholder capital in my lifetime. Amazon, Oracle and MSFT are definitely using AI to make cloudside plays but I don’t see Google cracking the top 3. However I think there remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in delivering high quality search — you know, the kind Google had up to about 2015 or so. It may be a situation where we are both correct to an extent. Don’t forget that Alphabet also owns DeepMind, which I would argue is one of the largest AI companies (that has certainly been overshadowed by others like OpenAI recently). In the Project Nimbus contract (the deal between the Israeli state and AWS and Google Cloud to build 6 “soverign” data centres), Israel stated specifically that they chose Google and AWS over Microsoft and Oracle because of their increased AI capabilities. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. As a reader of NC for over 20 years I am truly humble to have posted the post that triggered this conversation. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology. See companies like Kodak and Blockbuster that failed to adapt. This is more like Kodak choosing to abandon film for disappearing ink technology than any kind of film vs digital ink debate.
