Two of the biggest standalone VR headsets are about to do battle When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We're living in the age of standalone, mixed reality headsets, and with lots of brands getting in on the fun it's getting more and more important to be armed with the knowledge of which one is right for you. Unless you have thousands to splash out on one, there are two rivals duking it out for the top spot, the Pico 4 Ultra, and the Meta Quest 3. Squaring off for this Saturday night blockbuster fight are two headsets that can offer a lot of versatility. Whether you just want one of the best VR headsets for immersive gaming, you want spatial computing power, or you want a fun new way to enjoy some you-time without distractions, the Pico 4 Ultra and Meta Quest 3 are great products for you to consider. Although the Meta Quest 3 is much more commonly known, you shouldn't count the underdog out early. The Pico 4 isn't available in US markets, so that does take it out of contention for a lot of readers. Still, if you're anywhere else in the world, the Pico 4 Ultra is an extremely formidable opponent for Meta's Quest 3, and may even top it in certain aspects. There's a multi-round battle ahead of us, so grab your popcorn and get ready for a classic. Zuck's Meta Quest 3 is off to a raring start, as we all suspected. The Pico 4 Ultra just hasn't turned up in this opening round. Since the Quest 3 is available at so many retailers in the US and UK, it's the clear winner here. The Pico 4 Ultra is available in the UK though, and although I've seen it dip out of stock just once since its release, I'd say it's probably the harder of the two headsets to come across. As it continues to age, the Quest 3 is likely to get more discounts, bundles, and deals too. Let's not forget that the Meta Quest 3 comes in a few different variations too. The Pico 4 Ultra has one 256GB SKU, whereas the Quest 3 has its 512GB model, the 3S 128GB model, and the 3S 256GB model as well. The Quest 3 did have a more affordable 128GB version, but that's since been discontinued now that the 3S headsets are here. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Winner: Meta Quest 3 This is the round where things get interesting. After a near knockout in that first round, Pico 4 Ultra seems to have woken up, and we've got a real fight on our hands. On paper, the Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra have very similar specs. They both share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which in fighting terms is equivalent to having the same coach. In short, you're going to get very similar experiences with both of these devices, and there isn't much that separates them. Pico 4 Ultra Meta Quest 3 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Resolution 2160 x 2160 per eye 2064 x 2208 per eye Refresh rate 90Hz Variable - 72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz Field of View 105 degrees 110 degrees Sensors iTOF Depth sensor, Two MR cameras RGB cameras, 4 IR cameras Lenses Pancake Pancake Display 2 x LCD 2 x LCD Storage 256GB 512GB Cameras 2 x 32MB cameras 2x RGB 18PPD cameras Audio Integrated speakers Integrated 3D spatial audio speakers RAM 12GB LPDDR5 8GB Weight 580g 515g Eye Tracking None None Battery 5700mAh (2-4 hours depending on use) Up to 2.2 hours average Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, USB-C WiFi 6E, USB-C As you can see, it's a very close match-up to call between these two headsets. The tale of the tape has a lot of back and forth and a lot of things that are virtually the same, or cancel one another out. The Pico 4 Ultra has strengths in its Wi-Fi 7 support which means it'll be faster to install games and content. It also has 12GB of RAM up from 8GB in the Quest 3, which arguably futureproofs it more for more demanding VR games that have larger levels. RAM is really important in terms of VR computing power, so that's a huge win to have. The Pico 4 also does a great job of its crystal clear cameras and room tracking thanks to a depth sensor the Quest 3 doesn't have. The Quest 3 has more versatility when it comes to refresh rate, since depending on the application and what feels right for you, you can vary the frame rate of the headset from 72Hz to 90Hz, or even 120Hz. 110 degrees of horizontal field of view feels like a cheap win over the Pico 4 Ultra's 105, but it is a slight disparity. Storage also sits in the Quest 3's corner, although I'd argue this is less of a win in VR, since applications and games take up such a small amount of space compared to flat-screen games. Whatever Meta's been doing with audio has paid off though, and a big win for the Quest 3 comes in its quality of sound. While weight technically goes in Meta's favor too, I'd argue it's one of the specs that's virtually identical, for reasons I'll come onto. This is a tough round to call, but I think the wins that Pico 4 Ultra has in terms of its spec sheet are more significant strikes than the ones the Quest 3 can land. It's more about futureproofing in this arena, and the 12GB of RAM and increased Wi-Fi speed do make a big difference. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra (but not by much) If there's one disparity on the spec table that makes no sense, it's that the Meta Quest 3 weighs less than the Pico 4 Ultra. That's because the Pico 4 Ultra is designed to sit so comfortably on your face, and the way it distributes its weight across your head deserves a lot of credit. Longer sessions fly by while wearing this device, and that's down to some excellent design. A lot of that comes down to the fact that Pico's headstrap is much more substantial than Meta's. It reminds me of the one used for the Meta Quest Pro, and it feels like better value for money than the very simple material strap you get with the Quest 3. On the other hand, the best Meta Quest accessories do allow you to personalize your device to suit the comfort and weight distribution you'd like, so it's not a total walkover in this round. I'd argue this is a nice parry, but not an ideal counter since accessories demand more money on top of the headset. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra This one is another complicated round, and it's a bit of a shame, really. The Meta Quest 3 launched in October of 2023 and its 512GB SKU landed a lofty price tag of $649 / £619. The Pico 4 Ultra then launched just under a year later, and with a 256GB storage capacity that fit between the Quest 3's two models in price while touting some beefier specs. It launched to the tune of £529 in the UK, coming in comfortably under the Quest 3's larger 512 variant and making an excellent name for itself in the process. As an underdog, it really felt as though this was going to be a necessary move to win favor among VR shoppers who knew Meta's Quest brand well. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before things turned sour for Pico. The Quest 3S devices launched at $299 / £299 for 128GB, and $349 / £349 for 256GB. The Quest 3 128GB model was discontinued, and the 512GB Quest 3 received a price drop down to $499 / £469. It feels like a low blow has been struck to the underdog Pico 4 Ultra while the referee wasn't looking, and the Quest 3 has a smug look on its face as it walks back to the corner. Winner: Meta Quest 3 One of the biggest slights I hear against the Pico headsets is that they don't have access to the number of games that the Quest 3 has, and while that is true, it really isn't as bad as you think. A lot of the VR heavy hitters are still available on both headsets and if this is really a concern for you, maybe check to see if your favorite games are exclusive to one or the other before purchasing. You may find like I did, that the list the Pico 4 Ultra misses out on isn't actually that long. Both have access to Steam Link and can be hooked up to a gaming PC, so if you plan to tether to a beefier machine that can access SteamVR's library of games, both will do you just fine. Meta's Horizon OS does tend to be the first one to be thought of, however, so who knows what the future may hold as it likely continues to become the larger platform. Winner: Meta Quest 3 This one is slightly subjective, but from testing both headsets extensively and going through the process of reviewing them, I'd argue the Pico 4 Ultra is the better gaming device. It's a comfier headset that again, thanks to that weight distribution, extra RAM, and better depth sensing, makes immersive gaming experiences so much richer. There are fewer technical stutters that remind you you're running a standalone device through its paces, controllers track a bit more consistently, and in all honesty, I noticed more visual detail in Pico 4 Ultra games. At the same time, the visual fidelity on both headsets is virtually identical since their lenses, resolutions, displays, and FOVs are so close to one another. Meta Quest 3 has better passthrough quality since, for some reason, you can clearly read content on other screens better, but either will give you great passthrough quality. I'd say one of the big difference makers in this department is the controllers, which on the Pico 4 Ultra, are just that little bit better. They're marginally longer than the Quest 3 and have a few extra buttons, and it's amazing the difference this makes in games like Blade and Sorcery. Then again, the Quest 3 has some really polished hand-tracking features these days, if that's your thing. I think the motion trackers that come with Pico's device do add a lot more potential for immersive gaming experiences though. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra It's been an exhausting fight for the ages. Both combatants have come away bloody, beaten up, and bruised, and while neither has scored a decisive victory, there can only be one champion. I think the Pico 4 Ultra is, in a lot of ways, a better headset than the Quest 3. It feels a lot more tilted toward power users and those who want a futureproofed device that'll be able to run demanding VR games without compromise for years to come. It feels designed to counter some of the worst parts of the Quest 3. It's comfortable without the need for extra accessories, and its controllers aren't so small they lose tracking capability. Its software offering isn't as limited as some make it seem, and there's a lot of potential to use it in versatile ways, like any mixed-reality device today. It is hugely limited by its reluctance to enter the US market, however, and it's a shame we probably won't see a direct fight on the shelves between such close rivals. The Quest 3, thanks to its accessibly priced Quest 3S models, does a lot to bring VR technology into the mainstream limelight. In this day and age, it's the affordable, versatile, and genuinely capable VR device to own. In other words, the Quest 3 wins, but only because it had a home advantage.

Title: AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks. Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas. Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement. On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution. One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic. “You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.” Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality. The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation. Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise. “The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.” Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale. “It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said. On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.” DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels. Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns. So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube. One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers. “I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.” DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate. Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.” “It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.” Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out. Contextual adtech firms are focusing on signal loss fears, AI and brand safety to snare more clients. Across the board, there have been precipitous ad tech stock price declines, even if earnings are on the rise. WPP and Stagwell painted considerably different portraits of the future in the guidance they offered for the rest of 2025.

Title: The top wealth-creating stocks have put $21 trillion back into shareholders' pockets — and 3 are still cheap to buy

Past performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation. But that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars — like AI players — in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years. She also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever. In this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid. The list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value. However, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company. Nonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates. Microsoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending. Its fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply. Alphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business. Even as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. UnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud. Its stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes. However, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty. Jump to

Title: Nvidia: A complete guide to the hardware company behind the AI boom and its chips, financials, and leadership

Nvidia has been around for over three decades, but the chipmaker became a household name only in the past couple of years. Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem "with a vision to bring 3D graphics to the gaming and multimedia markets." The boom in AI technology has made it one of the most valuable companies in the world as companies scramble to buy its graphics processing units. Here's what you need to know about Nvidia. Nvidia's origin story began at a Denny's during a meeting between Huang — who once worked for the chain — Malachowsky and Priem. Personal computing was on the cusp of taking off, and the trio sought a way to capitalize on it. Huang said in a 2010 interview with Stanford University's engineering school that they "wondered whether starting a graphics company would be a good idea." "We brainstormed and fantasized about what kind of company it would be and the world we could help," he said. "It was fun." Their goal was to improve the experience of gaming on a PC. By 1999, the year it went public, Nvidia had invented the graphics processing unit, a computer chip that can handle many tasks simultaneously. It had faced challenges; it built two chips that failed, and it nearly went bankrupt. But it had also established itself as a formidable player in the industry, partnering with companies such as Sega, Dell, and Micron and winning rounds of funding from the venture firms Sequoia Capital and Sierra Ventures. In 2006, it released CUDA, a general-purpose programming interface that would expand its business far beyond gaming. On Sequoia Capital's "Crucible Moments" podcast, Andrew Ng, a Stanford professor who founded Google Brain, recalled his students telling him, "Hey, Andrew, there's this thing called CUDA — not that easy to program, but it's letting people use GPUs for something different." "We started to see 10x or even 100x speedups training neural networks on GPUs because we could do 1,000 or 10,000 things in parallel rather than one step after another," he added. Nvidia's GPUs were used to train AlexNet, an image classification system unveiled in 2012 that significantly influenced the field of deep learning. The launch of ChatGPT in late 2022 ushered Nvidia into a new era. The chipmaker's shares surged by more than 800% from the start of 2023 to the start of 2025. Much of that growth came from the success of Nvidia's H100 chip, which it released in March 2022. The $40,000 chip, named for the computer scientist Grace Hopper, has played a crucial role in providing the computing power for large language models. Nvidia's success may be best personified by its CEO: Jensen Huang. A 61-year-old bona fide tech mogul, Huang has a net worth of about $110 billion. While some execs sport chains or Patagonia vests, Huang is often spotted in a leather jacket. BI identified at least six versions he's worn over the years, including a nearly $9,000 lizard-embossed coat from Tom Ford he wore at the company's global AI conference, GTC, in 2024. He commemorated Nvidia's stock price hitting $100 with a tattoo of Nvidia's logo on his arm. Huang's early years were tumultuous. He was born in Taiwan, and he spent time there and in Thailand before his parents sent him to the United States because of social unrest in the region. He attended a reform school in Kentucky. In an interview with NPR in 2012, he recalled that "the kids were really tough," adding: "They all had pocket knives — and when they get in fights, it's not pretty. Kids get hurt." He later moved to Oregon, where he was reunited with his parents. In high school, he became a nationally ranked table tennis champion. Huang graduated from Oregon State University with a degree in electrical engineering in 1984. During his freshman year, Huang met Lori Mills, his future wife. In an interview at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, he said he won her over by offering to help her with her homework. They married five years after meeting and now have two children: Madison Huang, a marketing director at Nvidia, and Spencer Huang, a senior product manager at the company. Jensen Huang later earned a master's in electrical engineering from Stanford and he worked at the chip companies LSI Logic and Advanced Micro Devices before launching Nvidia. Huang sold about 1.3 million shares of Nvidia when the company hit a $3 trillion market cap in June 2024, but he retains a more than 3% stake in the company. Nvidia's business is built around GPUs, which can handle tasks simultaneously, as opposed to central processing units, or CPUs, which are in standard computers. Nvidia's GPUs have become a mainstay of the AI revolution because they provide the computing power needed to run massive large language models like OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's Llama 3. Demand for Nvidia's H100 chips, built on its Hopper architecture, has been so high in late 2023 and 2024 that tech execs like Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk have bragged about how many units they're training new technology on. ByteDance has found workarounds to US export bans on the chips to China. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have bought up thousands of units to fuel their AI ambitions, while venture capitalists have bought Nvidia GPUs as backup units for their startups. Last year, Nvidia unveiled its Blackwell chips, which it says are twice as fast as its Hopper chips and have attracted customers including SoftBank, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft. The recent frenzy around the Chinese company DeepSeek's models has fueled demand for Nvidia's H200 chips. But a key to Nvidia's success is CUDA, a software layer that can link GPUs to almost any AI application a developer wants to run. It's a critical component of the competitive advantage, or moat, that Nvidia has built up over the years. Still, AMD, Nvidia's main competitor, is quietly catching up. In AMD's third-quarter earnings call in October 2024, CEO Lisa Su said the company had "closed a good part of" the gap with Nvidia. Nvidia's other competitors include Intel and IBM. Tech giants like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta have also released their own AI chips. In January 2025, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Huang unveiled new chips targeting the gaming, robotics, and autonomous vehicle industries, as well as partnerships with Toyota and Microsoft. Nvidia has been competing with Apple and Microsoft for the title of the most valuable company in the world. It briefly surpassed Apple to take the top spot numerous times in 2024 and again in January 2025, when its market capitalization reached $3.45 trillion. For the fiscal quarter that ended January 26, 2025, Nvidia's earnings call reported record revenue of $39.3 billion, up by 78% from the prior year. Net income for the quarter was more than $22.1 billion, up by 80% from the prior year. Nvidia is based in Santa Clara, California. Nvidia's headquarters, known as Voyager, was designed by the architectural firm Gensler and is about 750,000 square feet. It has parks, "treehouses" for gatherings, and places designed to help employees focus. However, the overall design is intended to facilitate Nvidia's flat organizational structure. "When you're moving that fast, you want to make sure that that information is flowing through the company as quickly as possible," Huang told the Harvard Business Review in 2023. It's also a way to create more harmony between leadership and workers. Huang, who in 2023 oversaw 50 direct reports, has said that CEOs "by definition" should have the most direct reports at a company. Huang has earned a reputation among those who work with him as a demanding boss. Meetings with Huang can get heated, and senior employees have described his tough questions as a "Jensen grilling." Nvidia's top executives include Ian Buck, a vice president of hyperscale and high-performance computing; Colette Kress, the chief financial officer; and Bryan Catanzaro, a vice president of applied deep learning research. Landing a job at Nvidia isn't easy, but Lindsey Duran, a VP of recruitment, told BI that Nvidia applicants should express an interest in generative AI, tap into their professional network for referrals, and aim to do an internship.

Title: Google’s co-founder tells AI staff to stop ‘building nanny products’

Also: more on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. Also: more on Meta’s war against leakers, Gavin Newsom’s message to the tech industry, and Amazon’s buggy Alexa revamp. by Alex Heath For the last couple years, it has been evident that Google cofounder Sergey Brin is back in the building. This week, he sent a clear message to hundreds of employees in Google’s DeepMind AI division, known as GDM: the pressure to win the AGI race is on. “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM,” begins his note, which The New York Times first reported on yesterday and I’m publishing below in full. “We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts.” Brin goes on to recommend that Google’s AI teams work longer hours (“60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity”), come into the office “at least every week day,” prioritize “simple solutions” to problems, and generally move faster (“can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python”). What stuck out the most to me was his last point: that Google’s AI products “are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds.” According to Brin, Google needs to “trust our users” and “can’t keep building nanny products.” While his note was intended for a small audience of AI researchers at DeepMind and not all of Google, it’s still remarkable in a couple of ways. For one, it came from Brin, who technically has no formal role these days besides being a board member, and not Demis Hassabis, who runs Google DeepMind. As some employees have poined out to me, there’s also irony in Brin recommending that employees work 12-hour days when he and cofounder Larry Page arguably left Google rudderless when they retired in 2019 — just before this AI boom cycle began in earnest. Finally, it’s telling that Brin, who attended President Donald Trump’s inauguration with CEO Sundar Pichai, is now using his power to seemingly push for removing Gemini’s guardrails. You can read Brin’s full note to Gemini researchers below: “It has been 2 years of the Gemini program and GDM. We have come a long way in that time with many efforts we should feel very proud of. At the same time competition has accelerated immensely and the final race to AGI is afoot. I think we have all the ingredients to win this race but we are going to have to turbocharge our efforts. Code matters most — AGI will happen with takeoff, when the Al improves itself. Probably initially it will be with a lot of human help so the most important is our code performance. Furthermore this needs to work on our own 1p code. We have to be the most efficient coder and Al scientists in the world by using our own Al. Productivity — In my experience about 60 hours a week is the sweet spot of productivity. Some folks put in a lot more but can burn out or lose creativity. A number of folks work less than 60 hours and a small number put in the bare minimum to get by. This last group is not only unproductive but also can be highly demoralizing to everyone else. Location — It is important to work in the office because physically being together is far more effective for communication than gve etc. And, therefore you need to be physically colocated with others working on the same thing. We need to minimize reporting lines across countries, cities, and buildings. I recommend being in the office at least every week day. Organization — We need to have clear responsibility and organization with high functioning groups with shared management and technology leadership. Simplicity — Lets use simple solutions where we can. Eg if prompting works, just do that, don’t posttrain a separate model. No unnecessary technical complexities (such as lora). Ideally we will truly have one recipe and one model which can simply be prompted for different uses. Excellence — whether it’s an eval or a data source or a dashboard or a message in an internal Ul, please make sure they all work and all are good. Speed — we need our products, models, internal tools to be fast. Can’t wait 20 minutes to run a bit of python on borg. Iterate at small scale — we need lots of ideas that we can test quickly. The best way to do this is small scale experiments until you can ramp up and hopefully see increasing advantage at scale. This is an excellent validation. Working too much at just large scale has a habit of minor tweaking and overfitting to evals, checkpoint sniping, etc. We need real wins that scale. No punting — we can’t keep building nanny products. Our products are overrun with filters and punts of various kinds. We need capable products and [to] trust our users.“ By now, most employees at Meta have probably seen my story about the company firing around 20 employees for leaking. (A special thanks to the communications team for widely sharing it on Workplace!) Cracking down on leaks is nothing new for Meta, though leadership does seem highly motivated to snuff out this recent wave. Moments after my story was published yesterday, CTO Andrew Bosworth addressed the firings during a company all-hands meeting that was, yes, leaked to me. After joking about how chairs had been rearranged in the room to make the all-hands look more well attended than it actually was, here’s what he had to say about leaks: “There are three different types of leaks. A lot of times there are accidental leaks, people who are just being casual [and] clumsy with information. They’re trying to share it to a friend, a housemate, their mom, and they’re not paying attention to what they’re doing. The second kind is people who are trying to be helpful. ‘If only the press understood this one thing, then they would surely tell a good story about us.’ They won’t. And then there’s malicious leaks, antagonistic leaks, people who are trying to push an agenda that they hold and they think is more important to them than the company. All three of those leaks are fireable offenses. All three of them. And we take them seriously. We have a team dedicated to identifying these leaks. And so we did conduct a bunch of investigations and we fired more than 20 people for leaking in the last couple of weeks. More than 20. That’s not the entirety of the list. There’s quite a few more investigations that are proceeding right now. So, just to remind everybody, don’t be screenshotting stuff, don’t be recording stuff. We are getting pretty good at finding these things and those people aren’t here anymore… We just have zero tolerance. It doesn’t matter what the excuse is. It doesn’t matter how innocuous you think it was. We just fire those people. Okay. Great. Fun. Boy, we’re really off to a great roll. Nobody’s here. We fired people… And they wonder why they gave me the Q&A.” If you haven’t already, don’t forget to subscribe to The Verge, which includes unlimited access to Command Line and all of our reporting.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 28 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems.

Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell.

At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations.

It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: Investors Are Making Big AI-Based Sentiment Bets
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hershshefrin/2025/02/28/investors-are-making-big-ai-based-sentiment-bets/
Time Published: 2025-02-28T06:34:07Z

INDIA - 2023/02/17: In this photo illustration, the logo of Amazon is seen displayed on a mobile ... [+] phone screen with AI (artificial intelligence) written in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) There are indications that AI-enthusiasm is leading current stock market valuations to be driven by sentiment, the psychological biases of excessive optimism and overconfidence, rather than by fundamentals. Overvaluation bias increases the risk that companies will adopt big unprofitable investment projects. There are two separate issues discussed below which interrelate, namely capital investment and market valuation. Four of the largest U.S. companies engaged in AI have announced plans to increase their capital investment by 45%, a testament to their great optimism for the technology. The four companies are Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta. Of these, Amazon’s share of the planned increase in Capex is the largest, at almost one third. At the same time, U.S. stocks have held fairly steady, although the S&P 500 has declined by about 3% since the January 20 inauguration of President Trump. The traditional view is that a corporate decision creates fundamental value if the net present value of the associated cash flow stream is positive, or technically at least zero. Notice that this statement applies to fundamental value, but not necessarily to market valuations. Consequently, it is critical to distinguish between the two concepts, and to recognize when market valuations differ dramatically from corresponding fundamental values. In the presence of gaps between market valuations and fundamental values, there is mispricing risk to be borne, in addition to fundamental risk. During the dot.com bubble, mispricing-risk was high. Overvaluation led to many capital investments being funded that featured negative NPVs and then subsequent failures when the bubble burst. Investors would do well to keep this history in mind when making AI-based capital investments in the current environment. The NPV of a capital investment is the amount by which the investment changes the fundamental value of the company. The fundamental value of the company as a whole is based on the amount of cash a company generates over time, which is available to be paid to both the company’s debtholders and shareholders. This cash flow is called the company’s free cash flow. The fundamental value of the company’s stock is determined by the portion of the free cash flows available to be paid just to the shareholders. The case of Amazon provides a good vehicle for assessing the degree to which stock prices reflect psychological biases rather than underlying fundamentals. Elsewhere, I have written about similarities between Amazon and the other three companies mentioned above. A minority of sell-side analysts use free cash flow analysis to value Amazon’s stocks. Analysts at the former Credit Suisse, now part of UBS, are among this minority. The history of their past reports, as well as their recent reports, provides important insights into the degree to which Amazon’s current stock market valuation accurately reflects fundamentals. I should note that I reached out to both Amazon and UBS for comments on this post, but did not receive replies. On February 27, 2025, Amazon’s stock price closed at just under $210. The analyst team at UBS following Amazon set a target price of $230 for the stock. In October 2019, the team with the same lead analyst, Stephen Ju, established 2025 as the terminal year of their free cash flow analysis. In doing so, they divided their valuation number for Amazon’s stock into two components, one for the five-year period 2020 through 2024, and the other for 2025 and thereafter. A point very important for readers to understand is that for Amazon’s stock, in 2019 the analyst team assigned about 80% of the stock’s value to the period beginning in 2025. As a result, it is long-term issues that mostly drive the fundamental value of Amazon’s stock, not the short-term, day-to-day fluctuations upon which investors mostly focus. The significance of the long-term approach provides the reason why discussions about Capex are critical, as these expenditures significantly impact long-term free cash flows. Market psychology determines the degree to which the stock market is rational. Psychology impacts analysts’ estimates of free cash flows and it impacts investors’ reactions to market events. In a rational world, if analysts’ forecasts of future free cash flows turn out be reasonably accurate, then there is reason to judge that their valuation estimates would be relatively unbiased. Consider two questions. In October 2019, how accurate was the UBS analyst team in forecasting Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024? How accurate was the team in forecasting what Amazon’s market capitalization would be at the beginning of 2025? Based on my analysis of the UBS analyst report and Amazon’s financial statements, it appears that the UBS team significantly overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period 2020 through 2024. In this respect, the Covid pandemic might have been a contributing factor. That said, the ratio of the average annual free cash flow forecast to its actual value was four, an optimistic bias of 300%. This implies that had the analyst team used the actual free cash flow values for their 2019 valuation computation, their target price would have been 25% of the figure in their October 2019 report. The analyst team’s calculations from 2019 provide an estimate of what the value of Amazon’s stock would be at the beginning of 2025. The ratio of the actual value to the estimated value is 1.63, which means that the current market value of Amazon’s stock is 63% higher than what the analyst calculations from 2019 implied. Juxtapose the answers to the two questions. The UBS team severely overestimated by 300% Amazon’s free cash flows, and intrinsic value, during the period 2020 through 2024; and yet in 2025 Amazon’s stock price is 63% above UBS’ valuation estimate from 2019. In a rational market, this would be very surprising. However, the evidence suggests that the market is far from rational, and this is the point. An important reason why the analyst team overestimated Amazon’s free cash flows for the period beginning in 2020 is that they underestimated Amazon’s Capex. This, they did, to the point of assuming that Amazon’s property, plant, and equipment would decline from one year to the next, eventually approaching zero. The assumption of declining PP&E is unrealistic for a company like Amazon, and has no precedent in Amazon’s history. It stands completely opposite to Amazon’s stated investment policy at the time, and certainly to Amazon’s massive planned investment described above. Why the analyst team would make such an assumption is a matter of speculation. One thing to keep in mind is that for a given level of cash flow from operations, lower Capex implies higher free cash flows. Therefore, lower Capex, all else being the same, leads to a higher valuation. If the analyst team was looking for a way to construct the numbers to produce a higher valuation, this was a way to do it. In this regard, it is worth mentioning that the balance sheet the analyst team presents in their 2019 report omits values for the line item PP&E. Indeed, it is the only line item in the balance sheet with blank entries. Therefore, investors interested in the analyst team’s forecast for PP&E would have to compute the numbers themselves, which is what I did. Looked at this way, when developing their target prices, analysts can use upwardly biased estimates of free cash flow as a back door, nontransparent technique to capture irrational exuberance. It is just that in 2019, the Credit Suisse/UBS team were too light on the magnitude of this bias. For the record, consider the following fact. Suppose that in 2019, the analyst team used the actual figures for free cash flows to forecast the intrinsic value of Amazon stock at the outset of 2025. Then they would have arrived at a figure that is one ninth of Amazon’s actual market cap. In other words, had the team used estimates close to realized Amazon free cash flows, instead of what they actually used, it would have undershot Amazon’s 2025 market cap by almost an order of magnitude instead of by 63%. The difference between Amazon’s market cap and the estimate of fundamental value based on actual free cash flows is important. This difference is an indication of just how much bias there is in current market valuations for tech stocks, especially for companies making large AI-related capital expenditures. In 2017, the prices of technology stocks began to increase dramatically, reflecting a discernable change in investor excitement about technology. That year Greg Ip, now the chief economics commentator for The Wall Street Journal, created a video entitled “The Economy Needs More Amazons.” The website description of the video states the following: “The U.S. has observed a long period of low stock-market volatility and economic stagnation. The Wall Street Journal's Greg Ip believes the economy and markets could benefit from more risk-taking companies - creative disrupters like Amazon.com.” Amazon is a good company. For psychological reasons, investors exhibit a behavior pattern known as representativeness bias by assuming that good stocks are stocks of good companies. However, irrational exuberance can leads stocks of good companies to be bad stocks. Over the last five years, Amazon has been a good stock, returning 17% per year on average. Now 17% is well above Amazon’s required return on equity which was close to 10.5%, based on the analyst team’s October 2019 report. The point to keep in mind is that this return was not been generated by Amazon’s free cash flows, the basis of its fundamental value. Instead, it was generated by investor sentiment, the biased response to underlying fundamentals. Remember that the analyst team severely underestimated the rise in price of Amazon’s stock, even as it simultaneously overestimated Amazon’s free cash flow stream. Investing in stocks like Amazon involves bets on future sentiment as well as fundamentals. In a world of very high expectations for AI, and large capital expenditures in developing this technology, investors would do well to understand the extent to which they are relying on sustained and growing optimism to generate attractive returns. Analysts, investors, and corporate executives should be paying attention to the differences between market caps and corresponding estimates of fundamental value. However, there appears to be little evidence of them doing so.

Title: 'As good as it gets': Why one analyst says this is the peak for Nvidia
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-stock-price-outlook-q4-quarter-earnings-ai-blackwell-tech-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-27T20:20:35Z
Full Content:
After gaining 1,776% in five years, one analyst says Nvidia looks like it's hit a peak. That's according to Gil Luria, a tech analyst at DA Davidson. Luria wrote on Thursday after the chip titan reported earnings results that growth is set for a slowdown. "This is as good as it gets for Nvidia," he told CNBC on Thursday, the same day the stock saw a sharp decline of as much as 8%. Shares finished the day down 6% after the company's fourth-quarter earnings disappointed, dragging the tech-heavy Nasdaq 3% lower. For Luria, the concern is not whether Nvidia is executing on its strategy — because it is, with the company's fiscal year 2025 revenue more than doubling year-over-year to $130.5 billion. Instead, the concern is that Nvidia's growth is going to continue to decelerate. Clocking in at 78%, Nvidia's year-over-year fourth-quarter revenue growth was the company's slowest quarter of growth in nearly two years. Luria told Business Insider about some of the obstacles he sees ahead for the chip maker. First, spending for Nvidia's GPU chips by its largest customers, like Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Amazon, has likely peaked, even when considering massive increases to their capital expenditures guidance last month. "Their big customers increased their spend the most into Q4 as they ever have and probably ever will," Luria said. "Two of their three largest customers have said capex will be flat into the first half of the year." That's a big deal considering just over one-third of Nvidia's revenue comes from just three customers. This concern plays into the idea that there will eventually be an oversupply of Nvidia's GPU chips and waning demand for compute, especially as companies start to scrutinize the return on investment in AI. "Despite demand in the near-term continuing to be strong, we still believe a decline in demand for NVIDIA compute is inevitable as customers begin to scrutinize their ROI on AI compute," Luria explained. China is another big concern, with Luria arguing that even without the Trump administration's tariffs, Nvidia is facing increased competition. "There will be more restrictions on sales of chips to China so those sales are going to be under pressure," Luria said. In his earnings update note, Luria highlighted that Chinese labs are reportedly shifting their inference workloads to GPU chips made by Huawei, "underscoring the growing competiveness of compute in the region." But perhaps the most important factor is the see-sawing of Nvidia's profit margins due to its accelerated cadence of releasing a new GPU chip every year. "Everytime they get to 75% gross margins, a new product is going to drag it back down to the low 70s," Luria said. Nvidia's profit margin guidance was a weak spot in its latest earnings report, with the company expecting a gross profit margin of about 71% in the first quarter as it continues to work through the ramp in production of its Blackwell GPUs. Even with the tepid outlook, Luria isn't bearish on Nvidia. The analyst rates Nvidia at "Neutral" with a $135 price target. Shares of Nvidia initially see-sawed between gains and losses after it released its fourth-quarter earnings results, but the stock eventually moved decisively lower in Thursday's trading session, down about 4% to $126.49.

Title: Early economic evaluation of chelation therapy in kidney transplant recipients with high-normal lead
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0319022
Time Published: 2025-02-27T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Kidney transplant recipients (KTR) with high-normal lead have a higher risk of graft failure (GF). Clinically, chelation therapy using meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) removes lead. Despite the proposal that chelation therapy can prevent GF through lead removal, evidence is lacking. To guide research efforts, we conducted an early economic evaluation, aiming to explore the economic feasibility of screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA for high-normal plasma lead concentrations in KTR (i.e., the intervention) compared to standard of care. A Markov model simulated the life course of 10,000 KTR in the Netherlands from a societal perspective. Transition probabilities were estimated using the data from TransplantLines Food and Nutrition Biobank and Cohort study. Costs and utilities were sourced from publications and public data. Model robustness was investigated through deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Various administration strategies were tested. Five-year costs were calculated from a healthcare payer’s perspective. Value of information was assessed. The intervention was cost-saving and improved health, leading to a dominant incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. The result was most sensitive to transition probabilities (led by GF, followed by death with functioning graft and after graft failure). The probability of the intervention being cost-effective was 60%. Chelation strategies did not affect the result. The intervention applied to the Dutch KTR population could save €27 million in the initial five years. Further research is desirable if the cost of obtaining perfect information on GF survival is approximately below €4,000/KTR (all uncertainties under €5,000/KTR). The cost-effectiveness of the intervention is robust in KTR, except when considering the uncertainties around (graft) survival probabilities. Applying chelation therapy in the new setting we studied holds significant potential. However, trials that systematically assess the efficacy, administration strategies, and impacts on survival are crucial in updating the current evaluation and informing policies.

Lead is a toxic heavy metal predominantly found in environmental exposures, including ambient air, soil, dust, and various consumer products [1–3]. In the Netherlands, primary lead exposure originates from food and tap water supplied through ageing lead pipes [3–6], with additional contributions from legacy industrial lead and imported goods such as cosmetics [3]. Different from acute poisoning, where lead concentration surges over a dangerously high threshold, chronic exposure—from lifestyle factors, occupational settings and living conditions—poses a widespread public health concern [3,7]. Extensive evidence has indicated that even low-level chronic lead exposures can cause lead accumulation first in bones and then in kidneys [7,8], further contributing to nephrotoxicity and kidney damage [7]. As one of the risk factors for chronic kidney disease (CKD) among obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus [7,9], lead exposure and its harms have been overlooked. A recent observational study from Sotomayor et al. (2022), in which a cohort of kidney transplant recipients (KTR) was trichotomized based on plasma lead concentrations, demonstrated that higher plasma lead concentrations at a non-toxic level (high-normal plasma concentrations, i.e., high group), are independently and consistently associated with an increased risk of long-term graft failure [10,11]. Recognizing the detrimental impact of lead on kidney function, proposals as early as the 2000s recommended screening CKD patients for acute toxic and chronic high-normal heavy metal levels, including lead [12,13]. CKD is a gradual decline in kidney function that persists for over three months. It has five stages based on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). According to the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) foundation guidelines, end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) occurs when the kidneys can no longer effectively filter waste products from the blood for survival (i.e., eGFR < 15 ml/min/1.73 m2) [14]. Treatment for ESKD is limited to kidney replacement therapy—dialysis and/or kidney transplantation. Dialysis, a medical procedure that mimics normal kidney functions to filter waste products, can be performed either externally through machines (haemodialysis [HD]) or internally through the body (peritoneal dialysis [PD]). Modalities vary the costs of €95–€129 thousand annually per patient in the Netherlands [15]. Kidney transplantation, a surgical transfer of a healthy kidney from a donor into a patient, incurs initial costs of €56–€152 thousand; when successful, its subsequent annual upkeep expenses are substantially lowered [15]. Regardless, sustaining kidney function is essential at every stage. In addition to improving quality of life and patient experience, this is critical because kidney replacement therapy is expensive, and transplant failure would require dialysis or re-transplantation, placing further strain on resource-scarce healthcare system [16]. Acute lead poisoning is treated by chelation therapy [17], which uses chelating agents to bind metals and facilitate their removal through urine or feces. However, the efficacy of chelation therapy in reducing high-normal lead and its potential to prolong graft function through lead removal in CKD are mostly unknown. Earlier trials have shown that repeated low-dose chelation therapy with chelator calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (CaEDTA) effectively slows kidney function decline in CKD patients with low-level lead exposure measured by blood [18–21], which is effective over four years [22]. Despite positive results, these efforts have not been followed up or updated with technologies. For instance, compared to blood, lead measurement from plasma has a lower detection limit, higher sensitivity and better precision [23]. A newer chelator, meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), is currently preferred and commonly used due to reduced disruption of essential minerals, including calcium, copper, and zinc, and fewer side effects [24–27]. Its potential efficacies and possible oral capsule administration, relative to kidney replacement therapy, could theoretically delay the progression to graft failure and thus intuitively reduce healthcare costs in CKD. This may be particularly true for KTR. As the transplanted kidneys of KTR, compared to functioning native kidneys, face a heavier functional burden and demonstrate a greater susceptibility due to ischaemia-reperfusion injury during the transplantation procedure and intrinsically nephrotoxic immunosuppressants used post-transplantation, any means of reducing additional nephrotoxicity from these vulnerable transplanted kidneys could be essential to preserve graft function. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the economic feasibility and provide considerations for using oral DMSA to prevent graft failure in KTR with high-normal plasma lead concentrations compared to the standard of care. Given the early stage of the intervention (i.e., chelation therapy using DMSA) in a new setting (i.e., KTR) and a new treatment goal (i.e., maintaining graft functioning), we conducted an early economic evaluation aligned with guidance from The Early Health Technology Assessment (HTA) report drafted by the Dutch HTA consortium [28]. Using patient-level data from the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG), the Netherlands, we performed analyses on cost-effectiveness, budget impact and value of information. Particularly pivotal, the report also emphasizes the exploratory nature of early HTA [28]. While our findings are likely not definitive or policy-prescriptive, they provide a solid foundation and invaluable insights to guide and inform future research. An early economic evaluation was performed, which comprised cost-effectiveness, budget impact analyses and value of information. Incremental costs () and incremental effectiveness (, i.e., quality-adjusted life years [QALYs] calculated from utilities) for the intervention compared with the standard of care were calculated. The primary outcome is the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER = ). The analyses were conducted in accordance with the Dutch guideline for economic evaluation in healthcare and reported in line with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) 2022 checklist (S1 Table). Analyses were conducted in RStudio, version 2022.12.0 + 353 [29]. We used the data on adult KTR at the UMCG who participated in the TransplantLines Food and Nutrition Biobank and Cohort study (NCT03272841) [30], which is the same cohort in which it was found that elevated plasma lead concentrations were associated with an increased risk of graft failure [11]. The participants were recruited between November 21, 2008 and May 24, 2011. All participants provided written informed consent on enrollment. The study protocol received approval from the Medical Ethical Committee (Medisch Ethische Toetsingsingscommissie [METc]) of the UMCG (METc 2008/186) and was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The baseline characteristics of the hypothetical cohort and lead-concentration-based (graft) survival curves were based on an actual cohort size of 670 subjects with available plasma lead measurements. The plasma lead concentration was measured at admission for kidney transplantation and 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-months post-transplantation. Due to the lead stability that was found over this two-year follow-up period [11], the values at the admission were used, with a median of 0.31 µg/L (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.22–0.45 µg/L, distribution shown in S1 Fig). The trichotomized low, medium, and high groups had a mean plasma lead concentration of 0.19, 0.31, and 0.65 µg/L (S2 Table). A Markov model was developed to simulate the life course of KTR. A lifetime horizon (40 years from the first kidney transplant) and a one-year cycle length were used. The model, structured similarly to the one from Coerts et al. (2021) [31], consists of three health states which are functioning graft (FG), graft failure (GF), and death (Fig 1). A hypothetical cohort of 10,000 KRT entered the model at the FG1 stage. Since these patients still have options for re-transplantation if the transplanted kidney fails (from FG1 to GF1), a second transplantation was incorporated into the model (from GF1 to FG2). We assumed a maximum of two transplantations as a third transplantation is rare [32]. Every transplantation has a chance of primary non-function, which refers to an immediate and persistent functioning failure of a transplanted kidney (from GF1 to GF2) [33]. Each state has a chance of death, which can be categorized into death with functioning graft (DWFG) and death with graft failure (DwGF). Trapezoidal half-cycle correction was applied to account for events occurring at any point within a cycle [34]. The dashed arrow indicates primary non-function. From each state, it is possible to transition to the death state. FG1, functioning graft 1; FG2, functioning graft 2; GF1, graft failure 1; GF2, graft failure 2.

There is no screening for heavy metals. The intended intervention—chelation therapy—includes 1) initial screening of all incident KRT through an additional order of plasma lead measurement from the blood sample taken at the first post-transplantation regular checkup, 2) providing oral DMSA to the eligible KTR, and 3) among these eligible KTR, conducting follow-up screening in case of lead re-exposure every five years, using the blood sample taken via the standard of care, and administering oral DMSA if re-exposed. The administration of DMSA can be oral or intravenous. Considering the minor elevation in plasma lead concentration among KTR, oral DMSA was more suitable for our study and is more convenient to be administered at home. Oral DMSA consists of one or multiple courses of treatment, with each course comprising five days of capsule intake and a one-month waiting period for lead redistribution in the body, followed by a blood test to assess the results and determine if an additional course is needed. Blood tests were used for screening and monitoring in the process of chelation therapy; thus, their timing is important. The initial screening was conducted upon inclusion in the Markov process, and the follow-up screenings were conducted after the re-exposure period. The the lead removal effect was monitored at the beginning of the second year of chelation therapy and chelation therapy may follow depending on the results. The timeline and procedure of the intervention in the base case (BC) are visualized in Fig 2. The assumptions were as follow: a1) only the KTR in the high group were eligible for chelation therapy to achieve interventional benefits while avoiding potential side effects (i.e., intervention threshold 0.38 µg/L); a2) chelation therapy would help the eligible KTR to have a lowered lead burden from high to medium group (i.e., stopping threshold 0.38 µg/L); a3) no adverse event; a4) the eligible KTR would not require chelation therapy for at least five years after the first course of repeated chelation therapy; and afterwards, a5) in the follow-up screening every five years, 10% of the initial eligible KTR, would have a plasma lead concentration exceeding the intervention threshold, and thus, require another chelation therapy. Additionally, a6) lead stability was assumed, meaning that all KTR would remain in the same group except for the KTR eligible for chelation therapy who would transition from the high (medium) to medium (high) group due to the intervention (re-exposure). S3 Table elaborates on the rationales behind these assumptions and their potential impacts on results. Overall, the assumptions were deliberately conservative to ensure study validity and alignment with the study aims.

To estimate and extrapolate the transition probabilities for GF, DWFG and DwGF, parametric survival modeling was applied in compliance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline [35,36]. Models were fitted using the UMCG cohort with distributions including Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, Gamma, Log-normal, Log-logistic, and Generalized Gamma. Model selection was based on visual inspection, Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and expert opinions (co-author L.A.J. and S.J.L.B.) to ensure both methodological rigor and clinical applicability. Parameters from the best-fit models (i.e., GF: Log-normal, DWFG: Gamma, and DwGF: Gamma) were then used to extrapolate the survival curves to the model’s time horizon (S4 Table and S2 Fig), from which transition probabilities were subsequently calculated (, where i denotes time in years). For the GF endpoint (transitions from FG1 to GF1, and from FG2 to GF2), the parametric survival analysis was performed separately for each of the three lead groups at low, medium and high levels, adjusting for age, sex, transplant vintage, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 24-hour urinary protein excretion, to approximate the efficacy of oral DMSA in prolonging graft functioning through reduced lead. For DWFG (from FG1 and FG2 to Death) and DwGF (from GF1 and GF2 to Death) endpoints, the analyses were conducted in all KTR without lead trichotomization. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t001 The probability of re-transplantation (from GF1 to FG2) was based on literature [37], which was assumed to linearly decline from 0.15 after age 65 and reach zero at the age in the last cycle. The probability of non-primary (from GF1 to GF2) was assumed to be 0.7%, accounting for the patients with a third or fourth kidney in the UMCG cohort. The societal perspective requires both direct medical costs and indirect costs (Table 1). All costs were adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI) from Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek [CBS]) and presented in EUR 2022 [50]. Whenever possible, cost data were obtained from the Dutch costing manual for economic evaluations in healthcare [47]. Costs associated with chelation therapy were based on published price lists from the Dutch university medical centers and expert advice (co-author D.J.T.). Blood sampling costs, not available on the UMCG website and slightly varying across centers, were averaged. Given the lack of evidence on chelation therapy in KTR with high-normal lead concentrations, a low dose of 10 mg/kg/day was assumed [51,52]. According to the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (Rijksinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu [RIVM]) in the Netherlands, DMSA is an unlicensed drug with no domestic stock or suppliers. Hence, the capsules must be imported. The purchasing price of DMSA Succicaptal® 200 mg (15 capsules) for hospital pharmacists was €400.47, excluding 6% value-added tax (VAT) [42]. Blood tests for chelation therapy can be combined with regular outpatient visits every three months, meaning no additional costs concerning travel or outpatient services. Therefore, all procedures involved in chelation therapy can be considered an add-on to the standard of care. Costs per health state reflect those directly incurred by a patient being in a health state. For example, in the graft failure state (GF1, GF2), initial graft failure and ongoing dialysis costs were included. Dialysis costs depended on the chosen modality: Conventional center HD (CHD) requires hospital visits and trained professionals, while home HD (HHD) involves patients being trained to use a portable dialysis machine at home. Automated PD (APD) allows for automatic filling and draining of dialysate, while continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) requires manual dialysate change. Costs for transplantation and post-transplantation care were applied when a patient transitioned to or remained in the functioning graft state (FG1, FG2). One-off costs for death occurred when a patient transitioned to the death state. Following the Dutch guideline for economic evaluation in healthcare, productivity losses were estimated using the friction cost method. Annual costs were summed for each Markov trace and discounted at a 4% rate. Utility values for each health state were based on European Quality of Life, Five-dimension, Three-level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) values reported in a systematic review and meta-analysis (Table 1). In the graft failure states (GF1, GF2), the utility value was calculated in proportion of patients on HD (84%) and PD (16%). The utility for death was assumed to be zero. For each Markov trace, the annual QALYs were summed up and discounted at a rate of 1.5%. To assess the robustness of the model and results, univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis (DSA), multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), and scenario analyses were performed. In DSA, one parameter was varied at a time to the lowest and highest value of the 95% confidence interval (CI), with unavailable CI assumed as a standard error of 25% of the parameter’s value. Additionally, considering the high uncertainty in the price of DMSA capsules, variations of 50% reduction and 200% increase were tested. The results of the DSA analysis were plotted in a tornado diagram. In PSA, all parameters were varied simultaneously by random draws from their corresponding distributions: beta distributions for the utilities and the percentages of the working population; a gamma distribution for all the costs; and a normal distribution for the number of courses, time spent in hospital, the probabilities of re-transplantation and non-primary function. The uncertainties in the transition probabilities for GF, DWFG, and DwGF were incorporated by random draws from normal distributions defined by parameter estimates and 95% CIs of the chosen best-fit models (S4 Table and S2 Fig). Monte Carlo simulations were performed with 10,000 iterations and plotted in a cost-effectiveness plane with a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of €50,000/QALY, as recommended by the Dutch National Healthcare Institute considering the burden of disease (proportional shortfall: 0.63) [53,54]. To assess the probability of being cost-effective at different WTP thresholds, the simulation results were plotted in a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve (CEAC). Scenario analyses were conducted to overcome the uncertainties surrounding chelation therapy. Key assumptions, such as transplant vintage, time horizon, discounting, and inflation rates, were examined. The exploratory nature of the study prompted scenario analyses to investigate the intervention strategies, including the number of courses, effect waning and frequency of conducting follow-up screenings, and subsequent intervention (Table 2). Adverse events, although from the previous evidence unlikely to occur [52,55], mainly include e1) impact on other metals, e2) transaminase activities, and e3) skin reactions [51]. These adverse events are either inconclusive (e1) or naturally dissolved after treatment discontinuation (e2-3), with no significant impacts on patients, especially given the low DMSA dosage in our study. However, considering the vulnerability of KTR, two safety measures, checking for iron deficiency (e1) and liver dysfunction (e2), were added to the scenarios so that any adverse effects could be detected and acted on in time, ensuring patient safety. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t002 Budget impact analysis (BIA) assessed the short-term costs or savings of implementing chelation therapy in KTR in the Netherlands. The Dutch KTR population has a prevalence of 12,068 and an incidence of 957, according to the Dutch Renal Registry (Renine) [44]. It was assumed that all KTR would undergo a screening blood test and a third of KTR would be eligible for chelation therapy. A dynamic cohort and five-year time horizon were used with a healthcare payer’s perspective. The budget impact was calculated by the total number of patients multiplied by the discounted cost of the intervention at each cycle per patient. Value of information (VOI) evaluates whether further research to gather new data is justified by weighing the benefit of reducing uncertainties against its cost. The expected value of perfect information (EVPI), expected value of partial perfect information (EVPPI), and expected value of sample information were calculated in €/KTR across WTP and visualized in plots. Screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA in KTR with a high-normal plasma lead concentration (referred to as “the intervention” below), compared to standard of care, yields cost savings of €57.56 million and QALY gains of 351.88 per 10,000 KTR, thereby a dominant ICER (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t003 The 15 most influential parameters are illustrated in Fig 3 (all parameters see S3 and S4 Figs). Among all, the means of logarithm (i.e., meanlog) from lognormal distribution, used to calculate the transition probabilities for GF in the medium and high groups, has the greatest impact on both and This is followed by the standard deviations (i.e., sdlog) of logarithm, similarly used for calculating the transition probabilities for GF in medium and high groups, and the rate from gamma distribution used to calculate the transition probability for DwGF.

The probability of being cost-effective is 84.27%. When applying a WTP threshold of €50,000/QALY, the CEAC shows that 59.55% of the outcomes are cost-effective. Alternatively, when all parameters vary except for the parameters used to calculate transition probabilities for GF, DWFG and DwGF, the intervention is suggested to be 100% cost-effective (Fig 4B-C, results of varying one TP parameter at a time see S5 Fig).

An increased time horizon results in higher incremental QALYs and higher savings (i.e., 10, 20 and 40 years), with an observed small gap of between 20 and 40 years, indicating that most QALY gains and savings occur in the first 20 years of the model. Overall, the strategy variations in chelation therapy did not influence the dominance. incremental effectiveness; QALY, quality adjusted life year; incremental costs; BC, base case. incremental effectiveness; QALY, quality adjusted life year; incremental costs; BC, base case. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.g005 Initial costs for the intervention amount to €3.22 million, decreasing drastically to €1.92 million in the second year and further down to about €0.10 million from the third year onward (Table 4). In the first year, the health state-related costs match the ones with the standard of care but rise more gradually in the intervention arm. Generally, the intervention can incur €2.36 million additional expenses in the first year, transitioning to cost savings and increased savings from the second year onwards. In the first five years, €27.12 million can be saved. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.t004 Under the WTP of €50,000/QALY, the expected value of obtaining perfect information is €5,081/KTR (Fig 6, EVPI). To eliminate the uncertainties around the transition probabilities for all endpoints (i.e., GF, DwGF and DWFG), €4,542/KTR are required, when €4,095/KTR and €4,069/KTR are respectively needed to reduce the uncertainties in transition probabilities for GF among all KTR and KTR in medium and high groups (Fig 6, EVPPI). Across a sample size of zero to 1,000, gathering new information on the meanlogs—the parameter used to calculate transition probabilities for GF in medium and high groups—is estimated to provide an added benefit of €2,261–€2,521/KTR and €1,745–€1,950/KTR correspondingly (S6 Fig).

Our results suggest potential cost savings and health gains from the intervention, which is estimated to save around €27.12 million in the first five years of its launch compared to standard of care. A cap of about €5,000/KTR could eliminate all uncertainties, encouraging further research on the efficacy and administration strategy of oral DMSA. In the base case, the intervention is dominant compared to the standard of care. However, the DSA reveals uncertainties around the transition probabilities, substantially influencing the cost-effectiveness results. This uncertainty could be partially attributed to the limited number of KTR observations in the parametric survival analysis for the GF endpoint resulting from trichotomization. Additionally, the use of real-world data could cause variations across all endpoints due to clinical complexities. Nevertheless, other parameters, such as costs of center haemodialysis, discounting rate of costs, and utility at the state of functioning graft, while contributing some variations, have moderate impacts on the cost-effectiveness. The extreme variations in the price of DMSA capsules (50% reduction to 200% increase) introduce minimal uncertainties. PSA indicates that approximately 60% of iteration outcomes are cost-effective. To investigate the reason for the relatively low probability, we re-ran PSA by fixing the base-case values to the transition probabilities for all endpoints. The generated results, in line with DSA, show that whilevariations in other factors, such as direct and indirect costs, systematic considerations, and utility barely influence the intervention’s dominance, variations in transition probabilities are primary contributors to high ICER uncertainty. The transition probabilities for GF in the medium group and DwGF can expand the ICER cloud from the desirable () to the undesirable quadrants (), when the transition probability for DWFG mainly affects and potentially drives the ICER cloud towards the first quadrant (), thereby affecting the probability of the intervention being cost-effective. Additionally, scenario analyses suggest that the varying strategies of chelation therapy have limited impacts on the cost-effectiveness. Although the time horizon can modify and , the intervention remains dominant possibly due to declining marginal costs and effectiveness—as follow-up time extends, ageing KTR may experience reduced utilities, which were not accounted for in the current model. Our early economic evaluation presents a plausible probability of the intervention being cost-effective. BIA suggests €27.12 million in savings in the first five years from the intervention compared to standard of care. The initial investment is estimated at around €3 million, primarily due to the first scaled screening, which is moderate compared to the health state-related costs. In the following years, the intervention costs plummet. Synthesizing all available data and our results, the extreme price of DMSA capsules, seemingly flat CEAC curve and additional PSA inspections confirm the neglectable costs surrounding the intervention, offset by the potential savings from delayed dialysis and avoided transplantation. However, uncertain survival rates for all endpoints, particularly GF, are the main concerns, as they could substantially diminish the probability of the intervention’s cost-effectiveness, which currently still hovers around 60%. The desirability of further research to eliminate the aforesaid uncertainties depends on whether study costs remain below the thresholds revealed by VOI: approximately €4,000/KTR to gain perfect information on GF survival (€6,000/KTR if only in medium and high groups, i.e., = 4,000/2 × 3), €4,500/KTR on GF, DWFG and DwGF (€6,750/KTR), and €5,000/KTR (€7,500/KTR) for all uncertainties. Besides, added benefits vary mildly with sample sizes, suggesting a trial, at a small scale, with a preferably long follow-up period, and examining survivals at all endpoints—specifically, the efficacy of oral DMSA in preserving graft function through lowered lead—could already address key uncertainties exhibited in this study and improve decision-making. Grounded in the study explorations and results, future trials might consider or test the following aspects: Given the intricacies and uncertainties of the intervention, dependent on available infrastructures and resources, future trials might benefit from additional preclinical studies. Leveraging existing cohorts and registry data across regions, supplemented by measurement of plasma lead concentration, in-depth and large-scale investigations into the lead threshold and corresponding survival rates would be possible, thus refining the range for further trial exploration. In short, gathering empirical evidence, especially through (long-term) clinical studies, is indispensable for validating the model’s hypotheses and assumptions and updating follow-up evaluations on the intervention. Only with such dedicated endeavors can the likelihood of shaping policies, updating guidelines, and realizing the intervention in clinical practices be enhanced. To our knowledge, we are the first to systematically explore the economic feasibility of screening for and implementing chelation therapy using oral DMSA in KTR with high-normal plasma lead concentrations. We utilized real-world data from a large cohort spanning 2011 to 2020 and representative of the Dutch KTR population. We applied NICE guidance to calculate and extrapolate survival probabilities in different health states [36]. We explored various scenarios to address the uncertainties surrounding the administration strategies. Our early economic evaluation, a meticulous and rigorous assessment drawing upon the existing body of evidence, highlights the potential value of integrating chelation therapy into post-kidney transplantation routines and emphasizes the need for research to substantiate the true benefits of DMSA capsules among individuals with an elevated but normal level of lead in maintaining graft function. Importantly, we outlined key considerations to guide future endeavors. Despite its strengths, the study has several limitations. Firstly, utilities calculated from EQ-5D-3L were used, deviating slightly from the Dutch guidelines, and were not age-adjusted due to insufficient evidence. Nonetheless, delaying progression to graft failure remains preferable from a patient’s perspective. Secondly, including blood tests as separate costs may overestimate expenses, as chelation therapy could coincide with routine post-transplantation check-ups [62]. This decision, however, accounts for possible variations in the time of routine checks and flexibility in each step of chelation therapy. Thirdly, Markov models cannot track individual patients, meaning that KTR in the high group who surpass the treatment threshold at certain time points are unidentifiable, and transition probabilities thus could not be adjusted. This could cause a slight overestimation of effectiveness and explain the constant incremental effectiveness in scenario analyses. Fourthly, alternative DMSA access was unexplored (i.e., pharmacies purchasing raw materials from manufacturers to compound DMSA capsules) owing to data unavailability, though our results were insensitive to DMSA prices. Furthermore, our conservative approach—targeting KTR, applying a 0.38 µg/L threshold, lowering lead from high to medium group and excluding cadmium removal—has yielded modest QALY gains (0.106 QALY gains per KTR eligible for chelation therapy, i.e., = 351.88/10,000 × 3). This approach potentially underestimates overall effectiveness but ensures the study validity and is thereby preferred given the study aims. Lastly, due to the limited research on the intended intervention in this new setting, our assumptions were informed by expert opinions, current guidelines and publications. Although the number of assumptions implies that our study is primarily rooted in theoretical exploration, our study offers a robust foundation for subsequent empirical investigations, aligned with the objectives of early HTA to guide future research and support the development of the intervention. Preserving kidney function is paramount. In this context, our early economic evaluation suggests that screening for and implementing chelation therapy with oral DMSA in KTR exhibiting high-normal plasma lead concentrations is likely cost-effective compared to the standard of care, saving costs and improving health. The cost-effectiveness is primarily driven by (graft) survival probabilities while remaining robust against other uncertainties. The proposal of applying chelation therapy to individuals with normal-high lead to prevent graft failure is at an early stage but demonstrates substantial potential. Therefore, there is an imperative need for trials that systematically evaluate the efficacy and administration protocol of chelation therapy, including the optimal treatment threshold, addressing current gaps in evidence. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s004 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s005 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s006 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s007 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s008 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s009 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0319022.s010 (DOCX) We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the participants of the TransplantLines study for generously sharing their data and dedicating their time and efforts to research purposes.

Title: This Is the Biggest Trump-Musk Scandal That No One’s Talking About
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/192008/trump-musk-scandal-corruption-crypto
Time Published: 2025-02-27T11:00:00Z
Full Content:
In the months leading up to the 2024 presidential election, political ethics watchers, an endangered breed, worried about the increasing number of ways in which Donald Trump seemed to be for sale. “Trump keeps creating avenues for people to quietly give him money,” ran a Washington Post opinion headline, referring to the glitzy, $100,000 watches that Trump had recently presented for sale—purchasable with bitcoin. Steve Benen, an MSNBC columnist, suggested a dark scenario: “A hypothetical wealthy donor wants to give the former president a $100,000 donation—far in excess of the legal limit—so he or she buys an expensive watch. At that point, the nominee could take his cut and write a comparable check in support of his candidacy, since there is no legal limit on what candidates can spend on their own campaigns.” In the era of unlimited super PAC giving—when Elon Musk could throw hundreds of millions of dollars; the influence of X, the social media platform he owns; and his personal celebrity behind Team Trump with barely a regulatory hiccup—these concerns seemed practically quaint. Trump-themed nonfungible tokens, golden sneakers, gaudy watches, and other branded tchotchkes were small-time stuff, new incarnations of the steaks, the university, the airline, and many other failed products that Trump hawked as a private citizen. Compared to the $2 billion that his son-in-law Jared Kushner’s private equity firm received from the Saudi sovereign wealth fund—along with a nine-figure bailout from the Qatari government for his deeply indebted Manhattan office tower at 666 Fifth Avenue—it seemed that Trump had failed to fully monetize the power of his office. But Trump was already going after bigger prizes, pursuing potentially huge paydays while his donors and advisers developed plans to eliminate any legal, regulatory, and judicial obstacles still standing in the way of the ascendant American oligarchy. The new Trump administration wouldn’t just be open for business. With the aid of Musk’s DOGE wrecking ball, the administration would create the perfect environment for graft, self-dealing, and lucrative influence-peddling. And it would be legal, at least some of it. For now. One of Trump’s biggest business deals in recent history took a couple of years of waiting and some financial engineering, but it was worth it. In March 2024, after surviving a Biden administration investigation involving the Securities and Exchange Commission, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security into the financing of its special purpose acquisition company merger, Trump Media & Technology Group, or TMTG, the parent of Truth Social, became a publicly traded company. It did so with an assist from Jeff Yass, the options king, ByteDance investor, and richest man in Pennsylvania. After helping Trump find religion on ByteDance’s mega-popular app TikTok, Yass’s firm became the largest shareholder of the holding company Trump Media was merging with, helping the venture survive a lean financial period when two Truth Social investors pleaded guilty to securities fraud as part of an insider trading investigation. Yass sold his TMTG shares soon after the company went public; Susquehanna, his investment firm, also sold its TMTG shares, but later bought back in. Trump held onto his TMTG stock, which represented more than half of all issued shares. As of mid-February, his holdings were worth more than $3 billion, making them his most valuable asset—at least on paper. If Trump were to sell any of his shares, the already volatile Trump Media stock price would likely plummet. It’s possible that, like Musk and many other billionaires, Trump uses his holdings as collateral for large loans or other deals. Like much that underwrites Trump’s empire, the value of this collateral is pretty specious, a fiction of financial engineering. In 2024, Trump Media brought in only $3.6 million in revenue—a 12 percent decline from the previous year. Overall, the company reported $400.9 million in losses. Even so, Trump Media handed its employees $107 million in stock compensation while also instituting an executive stock buyback program. TMTG’s market capitalization was a nonsensical $6.59 billion. For someone who has long been a highly leveraged pauper-billionaire, in arrears on his bills, the stock offering must have been a revelation. Without doing much at all, beyond posting on Truth Social, Trump had a multibillion-dollar asset. There was potential for so much more. In mid-October, weeks before Election Day, Trump released his first cryptocurrency token under the auspices of World Liberty Financial, or WLFI, a new venture with which Trump and his sons had partnered. (Its founders include Alex and Zach Witkoff, sons of Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.) While it got off to a slow start, WLFI eventually sold tens of millions of dollars’ worth of tokens—with $30 million worth going to Justin Sun, a Chinese crypto entrepreneur with an exceedingly checkered career history and a taste for less regulated offshore markets. Sun is currently being sued—at least for the moment—by the SEC for fraud. He has every interest in becoming a business partner with the president who will appoint the next SEC chair. “Excited to have you part of the @worldlibertyfi team and our future working together,” wrote Steve Witkoff after Sun announced his investment. By Election Day, it seemed that Trump was not just open for business but establishing new avenues of payment and possible bribery unavailable to past presidents. Gone are the days of political operatives like Robert Maheu handing over suitcases of cash to Nixon administration officials. The payoffs travel on crypto rails now, in the relative open. Or they come as hundreds of millions of dollars in super PAC donations. President Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm in a blind trust seemed like the sort of accountability gesture that belonged to a far more naïve, less debauched era. After Trump handily won the election, the proverbial “For Sale” sign went up. Justin Sun, whose business interests include the TRON blockchain that is a favored money-laundering tool for global cybercrime, announced another $45 million purchase of WLFI tokens and began publicly advising Trump’s sons on crypto purchases. While Trump put his TMTG shares in a trust, there was little talk about his getting out of the crypto business or swearing off milking his voter base with fraudulent memecoin offerings. President Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm in a blind trust seemed like the sort of accountability gesture that belonged to a far more naïve, less debauched era. A few days before the inauguration, Trump crossed a Rubicon of grifting that seemed absurd even for him, releasing an official “memecoin”—more accurately called a shitcoin—an essentially worthless cryptocurrency token branded with the ticker symbol $TRUMP. The token had all the hallmarks of a pump-and-dump operation—dropped without warning and hyped by Trump’s social media accounts, with about 80 percent of supply reserved for insiders who would “dump” the tokens on retail traders after they surged toward a multibillion-dollar market cap. And that’s exactly what happened, with large holders quickly selling, while one company behind the coin reaped $100 million in trading fees. Most regular folks who bought and sold $TRUMP lost money. Back in the White House, on January 29, Trump Media announced a new DeFi, or decentralized finance, venture called Truth.­Fi. The new company would put $250 million into crypto tokens while offering crypto investment products to customers. It was at least his third distinct crypto company—not counting the $MELANIA shitcoin, which Trump also promoted. As Trump throws himself into one of the world’s shadiest industries, his government is smashing the regulatory and legal apparatus that once might have kept him and his donors in check. While Musk and DOGE take aim at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau—a major enemy of the crypto and banking industries—Trump is installing crypto executives, venture capitalists, and tech entrepreneurs in positions of authority across the government. A number of them come from Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm that poured billions into the crypto bubble, and whose eponymous founders emerged as major Trump backers. The SEC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and other financial regulators will soon be heavily staffed by crypto lawyers, fintech executives, and former government employees who passed through the revolving door into the private sector and are now returning, bearing the interests of their erstwhile private-sector employers. Against this backdrop, financial crimes and political corruption seem destined to receive minimal scrutiny under the second Trump administration. His Department of Justice has already tried to scrap criminal charges in the corruption investigation into New York City Mayor Eric Adams. The decision was announced as part of a brazen quid pro quo in which Adams, his legal fate held hostage to Trump’s goodwill, promised to devote more city resources to deporting migrants. Attorney General Pam Bondi has made a point of halting anti-corruption work, while Trump signed an executive order stating that the administration would “pause” enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans bribery of foreign officials and has been a useful check on wrongdoing by both U.S. and foreign companies (that can face prosecution in the United States for bribes paid abroad). The administration said that the FCPA “actively harms American economic competitiveness,” since multinational execs couldn’t pay the bribes needed to secure deals in competitive markets. We’re witnessing a monumental and sudden transformation of U.S. legal and regulatory systems. Even white-collar defense attorneys seemed rattled, wondering if this newly permissive legal landscape will cut into their caseloads. “Abolishing globally focused investigative teams and restricting the scope of overseas bribery and foreign lobbying transparency probes will have a significant impact on what’s been a boon for the defense bar this century,” wrote Bloomberg Law. With Musk and DOGE leading the push for austerity and privatization, Trump has established a form of corporate and political governance where financial crimes are tolerated, and even legal, if they redound to his benefit or that of his allies in tech and finance. At the same time, tech companies and their CEOs have offered more direct payments, giving millions to Trump’s inauguration committee. Amazon offered Melania Trump a $40 million documentary deal, which she negotiated with Jeff Bezos over dinner at Mar-a-Lago. That deal was part of an unprecedented postelection flood of cash moving from private industry directly to the president and his family—some $80 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, “as defendants settle lawsuits the president previously filed against them and corporations enter into new business ventures.” And rather than prepare to cover Trump critically, or to fend off the lawfare and intimidation he has long employed, large media companies seem in a rush to pay him off. After the election, Disney settled a lawsuit with Trump involving ABC News for $15 million. Meta shelled out $25 million in another settlement. CBS is reportedly considering negotiating a settlement with Trump over a 60 Minutes preelection interview with Vice President Kamala Harris that Trump falsely claimed was heavily edited in her favor, but executives at CBS’s parent company worry about the legal liability that might come with such a payoff. The Trump administration is duly applying pressure: Brendan Carr, the fiercely pro-MAGA, pro-Musk Federal Communications Commission chair, has been investigating the news program. On February 12, X agreed to pay Trump $10 million to settle a Twitter-era lawsuit relating to his suspension from the platform over his role in the January 6 Capitol riot. While some of these settlement payments went to a future Trump presidential library, that $10 million allegedly went directly to Trump, who now employs Musk as an adviser and special government employee. It seemed less like a typical legal settlement than a gift. Trump is, after all, the boss, and the boss needs to be paid.

Title: CEO Alex Karp says having Palantir on your résumé is gold. We asked tech recruiters if they agreed.

Time Published: 2025-02-27T10:57:02Z

Palantir CEO Alex Karp talks a big game when it comes to his employees. He's boasted on several occasions that Palantirians, as the company refers to employees, are the crème de la crème of tech workers. "If you work for Palantir, everyone knows you're good," Karp said on CNBC's Squawk Box on February 18. "No credible institution in commercial life can really be built without Palantir or an ex-Palantirian," Karp has also said. The company, which reported just under 4,000 full-time employees as of December 2024, recently hit an all-time high in its stock and brought in $2.87 billion in revenue in 2024. Following its most recent earnings report, Palantir hit a $240 billion market cap, surpassing companies like McDonald's and Disney. It hasn't only been clear skies, however, as Palantir's share price is down nearly 30% from its all-time closing high earlier this month. So do the people hiring from the tech talent pool buy Karp's glowing view of Palantirians? Business Insider spoke to half a dozen tech recruiting professionals to find out if having Palantir on your résumé is as powerful as Karp has made it sound. Deepali Vyas, a senior Partner and global head of data, AI, and FinTech at global consulting firm Korn Ferry told BI she can "absolutely say that he's right," and she considers Palantir the Goldman Sachs of the tech industry. "I've pulled people from Palantir," Vyas said. "They are a home run every single time." While she said Palantir employees tend to work long hours, the company has a "very hands-on culture" that allows even junior employees to work alongside the "brightest minds" at the company. Vyas said having that proximity helps create a certain level of training. Vyas said another factor that makes Palantir stand out is its ability to recruit people who are passionate about their work. "There's something in the sauce there," Vyas said. "They want to work on the complex problems because that's what excites them." Jason Saltzman, Director of Growth at Live Data Technologies, a company that tracks employment changes, told BI that "Palantir seems to be the stop on people's career journey that accelerates them the most." Almost a quarter of former product managers at Palantir have since become founders, he said. Ex-Palantir employees also tend to end up at a big tech company or "one of the hottest startups," Saltzman said. Google and Meta as well as Anduril and OpenAI employ many former Palantir workers, he told BI. "Not only is Palantir a rubber stamp on someone's résumé that allows them to go onto whatever they do next, but also many of them want to go solve the world's biggest problems that are shaping the future as we know it, either by joining a company or starting their own," Saltzman said. Aaron Sines, director of technical recruiting at global cloud consulting firm Edison & Black, told BI that there's some truth to Karp's statement, but overall he's seeing a "results revolution" among companies, where outcomes are placed above academic credentials and company names. "My team tells me all the time results are almost always coming over academic credentials," Sines told BI. Natan Fisher, the cofounder and co-CEO of tech and legal recruiting firm SingleSprout, similarly told BI that companies want to know how employees "operated under constraints, and whether they can drive impact in their environments." "No doubt, Palantir is a strong hiring signal, but the idea of a golden ticket in tech is outdated," Fisher said, adding that "the real hiring market doesn't reward brand names alone, it rewards execution and adaptability — who built what and scaled systems at speed." Fisher said that tech companies often seek to hire from "multiple high-caliber" talent pools such as Ramp, Stripe, Linear, and Notion, adding that they aren't clients of his. Sines said that Palantir has a reputation for seeking out top talent and having a "rigorous" and "results-oriented" hiring strategy. However, he said that while it carries a "badge of honor," for some clients, it may signal too much intensity for others. It depends on how companies perceive culture, Sines said. Farah Sharghi, a job search coach and former recruiter at tech companies including Google, Lyft, Uber, and TikTok, said that while Palantir's hiring process is "very stringent," a good employee at Palantir may not be a good employee everywhere else because "there might be some nuances to some companies versus others in terms of cultural fit." "A Palantir engineer who's used to working on some particular type of technology might not thrive in another different size company or different cultural company," Sharghi said. "So it's really subjective relative to what the company does, what their needs are, and so on." While culture may vary across tech companies, Sharghi says the guiding philosophy when it comes to hiring is largely the same across the board. "They're not looking for breadth of experience," she said. "They're looking for technical depth of experience." Alan Stein, the CEO of career-accelerating service Kadima Careers, told BI that "Palantir is a good brand name," but although it was considered, it didn't make his list of the top 100 companies that will accelerate your career. "I don't think that's as impressive as some of the other companies," he said. Stein, who has worked at several Big Tech companies, including Google and Meta, said that while Palantir candidates can definitely leverage their experience into data, engineering, or government roles, it doesn't have the same brand recognition as some other bigger companies, or Ivy League institutions like Harvard. "My hunch is more people would prefer four years of Harvard on their résumé," Stein said. Jump to

Forex traders react to US tariff news, boosting dollar; rupee closes at 87.21 against USD amid market volatility. TVS Motor Company has partnered with the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI), AMU Leasing, and Natural Resources Défense Council (NRDC) to launch the ‘Wheels of Empowerment’ initiative. Nvidia has once again delivered a stellar Q4 earnings update, posting $39.3 billion in revenue, which represents a 78% YoY increase from $22.1 billion in the same quarter last year, comfortably beating the market estimate of $38.1 billion. The real star of the quarter? Blackwell AI chips, which recorded a staggering $11 billion in first-quarter sales alone—the fastest in the company’s history. Net income also reached $22.1 billion (80% YoY growth), surpassing analysts’ expectations of $19.8 billion, suggesting investors might rethink their current strategy of investing in China and coming back to the US. Despite these impressive numbers, the market reaction has been rangebound due to the following reasons: A slight dip in gross profit margins (QoQ) Heightened competition Persisting customer concentration Stratospheric expectations Gross margins fell to 71%, barely meeting estimates but down from 73.5% last quarter, as the California-based company ramps up production of its cutting-edge Blackwell chips. The adjusted gross margins aren’t going to improve soon, with the management expecting it to remain in the low 70s due to “a significant ramp of Blackwell production”. The new-gen chips will have added complexities and involve higher costs as its CEO Jensen Huang admitted that the AI market is transitioning from generative AI to reasoning. Winner’s curse While a slight dip in margins is expected at this scale, Nvidia’s near-flawless track record has set exceptionally high investor expectations where even minor setbacks get magnified. Adding to the challenge is The potential upending of the chip market, as more players seek to replicate China’s DeepSeek, which has pulled the run from underneath the feel of US AI exceptionalism and created doubts about future AI linked chips volume and value growth. However, this time, the Nvidia brass was keen on stamping its products’ superiority, saying their chips are more advanced and have better use cases in the AI ecosystem. 57 of 63 of Wall Street analysts indicated a Buy rating for Nvidia since the earnings call, suggesting an emerging bullish sentiment despite the recent weakness of US tech stocks. Meanwhile, customer concentration risk remains, with major clients like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet (Google)’s current AI war continuing to dominate Nvidia’s revenue stream. In all, the world’s leading chipmaker, based in Santa Clara, California, has once again delivered strong results, but with the AI sector evolving rapidly and macroeconomic uncertainties looming, the margin for error is razor-thin. Investor sentiment remains cautious, as any perceived weakness—be it in financials, competition, or macro conditions—could weigh on the stock. In conclusion Nvidia’s numbers remain robust, shrinking gross margins notwithstanding. From an investment perspective, it remains a buy on dip, particularly with its next-gen Blackwell chips posting amazing numbers and protect Nvidia’s medium-term runway. In the short term, the upcoming Nvidia GTC conference, billed as the AI Woodstock, penned in for March 12 to 17 next month, will likely be another propeller.

Similarly, clarity on risk weights for MFI exposure for banks releases capital for growth. We refrain from concluding that the RBI is now satisfied with credit discipline in these segments. However, this would be sentimentally positive for the MFI segment. Basis the impact of these regulations, Bandhan Bank and Ujjivan Small Finance Bank would be most benefited. Amongst NBFCs, positive impact on cost of borrowings is expected to be under 0.1%, with Five-Star Business Finance and L&T Finance expected to see highest improvement.

Moody’s Ratings said India has a lower overall exposure to the US relative to others in the APAC region, although certain sectors such as food, textiles and pharmaceutical products face risks. Moody’s said most companies in its rated portfolio are domestic-focused with limited exposure to the US market. To mitigate pressure from reciprocal tariffs, the US and India are reportedly engaged in talks to lower import tariffs on select US products, increase market access for US farm products and increase US energy purchases, while seeking to initiate a trade deal by the fall of 2025. Across APAC, developing countries like India, Vietnam and Thailand have among the widest rate differentials relative to the US, Moody’s said. It said electronics, motor vehicles, food and textiles are the most exposed sectors. In addition to the hit from lower export demand, a key risk facing emerging economies in the region is that those aiming to nurture an export-led growth model similar to China and other advanced APAC economies will find it difficult to compete in an increasingly interventionist trade environment. US President Donald Trump has announced he will impose reciprocal tariffs on its trading partners, including India. The new US administration has already enacted additional 10 per cent tariffs on imports from China and 25 per cent tariffs on steel and aluminium. Moody’s said while the US is an overall net exporter of food, feeds and industrial supplies to APAC, it is a net importer of capital goods, automotive vehicles and parts and consumer goods. Reciprocal tariffs will have an impact on a number of key sectors in APAC with exposure to US final demand, such as computer and electronic products, chemicals, motor vehicles, as well as food, textiles and wood products. “India has a lower overall exposure relative to most others in the region, although certain sectors such as food and textiles as well as pharmaceutical products face risks,” Moody’s Ratings said. The rating agency said APAC’s overall policy response will be crucial in determining the full impact on credit strength. “We expect governments will likely act pragmatically, aiming to avoid escalation with the US, preferring to negotiate on a bilateral basis, as shown by recent developments,” Moody’s said. Given a more restrictive trading environment, currencies of targeted APAC economies could face continued downward pressure given potentially higher capital outflows and a likely stronger US dollar, with regional central banks having a much narrower window for easing domestic monetary policies to support economic growth. Most of these economies have adequate macroprudential buffers and sound monetary policy frameworks in place that will mitigate the impact of external shocks. Moreover, domestic demand in most parts of the region remains strong, bolstered by a modest easing of global and regional financial conditions, Moody’s said. Given the disruptions that lie ahead for the world trading system as result of US trade policies, governments in the region may also be further incentivized to achieve an enhanced degree of cooperation with one another, Moody’s said. ● Round also saw participation from Dewang Neralla’s family office and Jupiter Metaverse LLP along with other well known angels Dr. Ritesh Malik, Mr. Mitesh Shah, and Mr. Nilesh Doshi ● HiWiPay is a cross border payment platform revolutionizing international remittances for students, parents, and businesses ● Over the past 12 months, the company has partnered with over 500 consultants and expanded its operations across multiple cities in India, strengthening workforce in these regions to drive sales growth ● The Company plans to touch $100 million in transaction volume over the next 12 – 18 months ● Funds raised to be used to expand and enhance the trade remittance business, as well as to scale up operations in the education remittances sector ● The Company has built a portal that enables exporters to seamlessly collect payments with all necessary documentation in place Key highlights by DMI Finance Private Limited The global economy could undergo significant changes as the U.S., under President Trump’s “reciprocal tariffs” framework, seeks to renegotiate trade deals with major economies. This framework could potentially raise U.S. import tariffs significantly by factoring in tariffs, VAT, and non-tariff policies, and could disrupt decades of trade policy and challenge the post-WWII global order that has favoured free trade. India, with a high tariff differential with the U.S., may face headwinds from potential U.S. tariffs, but its relatively lower export dependence limits the economic impact. Further, India and the U.S. are actively negotiating a bilateral trade agreement, expected to be finalized by Sep - Dec ’25. This could potentially shorten the duration of any reciprocal tariffs, should they be implemented. With trade policy uncertainty, India is focusing on boosting domestic demand through fiscal and monetary policy measures to support growth. The FY26 Union Budget shifts focus from government CAPEX to boosting private consumption while maintaining fiscal consolidation. Aligning with fiscal efforts to boost demand, the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) reduced the policy rate by 25-bps in February to 6.25%—its first cut in nearly five years. India’s economic growth showed signs of moderate recovery in Q3, driven by continued robust agricultural growth, improved industrial activity, and resilient services. Recognising the moderate recovery and lower-than-expected GDP print in Q2, we revise our real GDP growth forecast for FY25 from 6.7% to 6.1%. For FY26, we project economic growth to show a moderate pick to 6.4%, factoring in policy support. Headline CPI inflation dropped to 4.3% in January, driven by a sharp decline in food inflation. It is expected to stay around 4% in February and March. This sets the stage for a potential 25-bps policy rate cut in April, though uncertainties from U.S. trade and tariffs persist. Economic Research Team The RBI’s measures to ease cost of and access to funding for borrowers and intermediaries (NBFCs) continue. This should further boost investor sentiment and help most NBFCs’ earnings over time. Among the biggest beneficiaries, we rate ABCL OW. PNBHF, SHFL, and BAF (all OW) are most preferred. Preferred stocks in view of this positive development: ABCL (OW) screens well on benefit to earnings, cheap valuation, and YTD underperformance; it is also a play on improving unsecured credit. Given the positive impact on overall group sentiment, we reiterate plays with stronger risk-reward: i.e., PNBHF (OW), Shriram Finance (OW) and Bajaj Finance (OW) – our preferred NBFC picks. The RBI notification on reversed the 16-Nov-23 notification of the additional 25% Risk Weight applied on the earlier rating wise risk-weight on a bank loan. However, the risk-weight increase to 125% from 100% on personal loans and credit card outstandings by NBFCs has been kept unchanged. Overall, we see this move (in addition to the 25bps repo rate cut earlier) as an important signaling from the RBI that it is getting comfortable with growth in the NBFC sector after the moderation achieved as a result of its Nov-23 actions. In terms of tangible impact, flow of funds to NBFCs from banks should improve hereon; notably, the fund-flow saw a considerable decline from Dec-23 to Dec-24. But the cost of funds (CoFs) for NBFCs will not see material improvement from this move, as CoFs had not risen too meaningfully following the RBI’s Nov-23 actions. Overall, outlook for the NBFC sector will continue to be driven by stable-to-slightly moderating AUM growth and stable NIMs, with sticky operating expenses and credit costs leading to slight moderation in RoAs in FY25 and H1FY26 vs FY24. Based on the risk-reward proposition, we prefer SHFL and MMFS. “India’s GDP growth in Q3FY2025 is expected to show an upward bias and is expected to be in the range of about 6.3-6.4%, primarily driven by increased government spending and improved household consumption during the festive season. Government capital expenditure surged to ₹2.7 trillion, marking about a 30% increase compared to the average of the first two quarters which was a bit muted due to general elections. This boost was aimed at stimulating economic growth amid uneven household consumption trends. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE), which constitutes ~58% of GDP, is expected to rise to 6.4% in Q3, following moderation in Q2 (5.4%), benefiting from festive season demand. Agricultural output remained strong, supported by favorable monsoons and higher Kharif crop yields, positively impacting rural consumption. The higher consumption (due to the festive season), higher government capital expenditure, and better agri-produce also helped the services sector in Q3FY2025. Besides, services exports have also shown upward trend in Q3FY2025 While long-term GDP sustainability depends on income growth, job creation, and private sector investment, the Q3FY2025 growth outlook remains positive, largely supported by public expenditure, conducive monsoon conditions leading to higher output in major Kharif crops, strong performance of the services sector, and services export.” “The restoration of risk weights to once again being based on external rating, for Bank lending to NBFCs, is a welcome move benefiting both banks and NBFCs. Lending to NBFCs constitutes ~9% of overall banking system credit. Revision in risk weights to the pre-Nov’23 levels will free-up capital for banks and provide additional headroom for credit growth to them. On the other hand, for NBFCs, banks have been a significant source of funding which was seeing a secular uptrend till the Nov’23 circular, which had increased risk weights on bank lending to higher rated NBFCs. Post implementation of the circular, bank lending to NBFCs stood almost flat at ~Rs.13 lakh crore for three quarters till Sep’24 seeing some revival only in the recent Dec’24 quarter. Restoring risk weights to the pre-Nov’23 levels could lead to additional credit flow from banks to NBFCs and thus increase funding availability for the NBFC sector”.
