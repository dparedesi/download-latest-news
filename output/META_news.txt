(Bloomberg) -- Warner Music Group Corp. stock dropped the most in 18 months after the company reported disappointing fourth-quarter results and said streaming growth stalled. The record label reported net income of $48 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, down 69% from a year earlier. Revenue rose 2.8% to $1.63 billion, beating the $1.59 billion expected by analysts. Recorded music streaming revenue increased 2.1% in the quarter, a significant slowdown from the 9.6% growth in the same period a year earlier and softer than some analysts expected. The shares fell as much as 11% to $29.96 in New York after the results were released but recovered much of those losses later in the day. They were down 5.9% at 2:53 p.m. Warner Music and its larger rival Universal Music Group NV have both been grappling with investors concerns over a slowdown in streaming growth. UMG stock got walloped in July after second-quarter results showed a deceleration in subscription revenue, which it attributed to a slowdown in subscriber growth at some platforms and as Meta Platforms Inc. stopped licensing premium music videos for Facebook. Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. also aren’t signing up a lot of new customers. Investors have known the streaming boom has been over for a while, but seeing the effects in the numbers has spooked Wall Street. Warner Music also said the end of its music distribution deal with BMG would weigh on financial results next year. In September, BMG, a unit of Germany’s Bertelsmann, said it would handle its digital distribution in-house, ending its nearly 8-year deal with WMG. In the first quarter, “streaming growth will be impacted by the BMG digital distribution roll-off, the digital license renewal in the prior year, and the lapping of Spotify price increases,” Bryan Castellani, chief financial officer of Warner Music Group, said on a call with analysts to discuss results. “Our digital distribution relationship with BMG that was planned to roll off by the end of fiscal ‘24 will now continue into fiscal ‘25.” That will affect revenue in the first quarter by about $16 million, he said. Recorded Music revenue was up 3.6% to $1.34 billion, in the fourth quarter, however the end of the distribution agreement with BMG resulted in $25 million less revenue compared with a year earlier, the company said. A renewal with one of the company’s digital partners also resulted in a $4 million “unfavorable impact” on recorded music streaming revenue. Music publishing revenue fell 1% to $295 million, missing analysts expectations of $313 million. (Updates with streaming revenue in third paragraph.)

Indexes ended higher on Thursday as traders digested another solid earnings beat from Nvidia. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped by almost 500 points, and the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq traded nearly flat as several mega-cap tech names struggled throughout the day. Here's where US indexes stood shortly after the 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Thursday: Nvidia stock whipsawed throughout the day, flipping between losses and gains before ending the day slightly higher, up 0.5% to $146.67 per share. The company reported another solid earnings beat, with revenue exceeding expectations and guidance coming largely in line with estimates. Over 20 firms boosted their Nvidia price targets afterward. JPMorgan upped its price target from $155 to $170, pointing to its strong competitive edge, while Goldman Sachs lifted its target from $150 to $165 on the expectation the company can deliver over $200 billion in revenue next year. "The team continues to maintain a 1- 2 step lead ahead of competitors with its silicon/hardware/software platforms," JPMorgan analysts wrote Thursday, adding, "The team is further distancing itself with its aggressive cadence of new product launches and more product segmentation over time." Meanwhile, tech stocks largely sold off. Google parent Alphabet ended over 4.5% lower as the US Department of Justice called for the company to divest its Chrome business in an anti-trust push. Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft also closed lower. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims dropped again last week, falling to 213,000, a 6,000 decline from the week before, according to data released Thursday. That number remains near the lowest since April. Continuing claims, or the total number of Americans collecting jobless benefits, remain high, though. Those claims rose to their highest in three years at 1.91 million last week, a 36,000 increase from the week before.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line.

Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail.

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel.

Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup.

The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours.

Millions of young Americans are forging unconventional paths to early retirement amid a growing desire for financial freedom and greater flexibility in spending their time. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the percentage of people willing to work full-time after age 62 fell to 45.8% in March, compared to 55% in March 2014. Don't Miss: Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." Here’s how you can earn passive income with just $100. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – Last Chance to get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share! How are young investors using dividend investing for early retirement? Let's examine a case study. Last month, an investor shared his detailed income report with portfolio screenshots on r/dividends, a discussion board for income investors on Reddit with 618,000 members. He said he reached about $61,600 in annual dividend income or $5,130 per month and was "finally able to retire." "There will come a day when I can put these distributions to good use. For now, we are just reinvesting," he added. The investor's portfolio showed most of his money was in risky, high-yield YIELDMAX ETFs that generate money by selling call options. Redditors quickly reminded the investor about how risky his investments were and why he could end up in losses during his retirement. However, the investor sounded self-assured, saying he was doing "not too bad right now." "Waiting till the end of 2024 to see where it’s at," he responded to a commenter who warned him that his principal was at risk of going to "zero." According to the screenshots shared by the investor, his total portfolio dividend yield was 9.89%. Since his annual dividend income is $61,600, his total portfolio value was roughly over $622,000. Trending: Over the last five years, the price of gold has increased by approximately 83% — Investors like Bill O’Reilly and Rudy Giuliani are using this platform to create customized gold IRAs to help shield their savings from inflation and economic turbulence.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq slides as Nvidia, Alphabet lead 'Magnificent 7' tumble

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies.

The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: What’s Happening With Google Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/21/whats-happening-with-google-stock/
Time Published: 2024-11-21T13:22:25Z

The Google logo displays on a smartphone screen in Reno, United States, on November 15, 2024. (Photo ... [+] by Jaque Silva/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) has been in the news lately, with the Department of Justice suggesting the sale of Google Chrome, and sharing data with rivals, among other measures to end its monopoly. The judge has set the trial on proposals for April 2025. Google will be given a chance to present its own proposals in December. [1] It was known that Google is facing antitrust cases and the remedies could be as extreme as selling the android platform. This overhang has also weighed on GOOG stock performance lately. Looking at a slightly longer period, GOOG stock has seen a 23% rise from levels of $144 in early 2022 to $177 now. This can primarily be attributed to: Google’s revenue growth over the recent years has been driven by its cloud business, which is seeing a strong momentum, with the segment sales surging a solid 72% between 2021 and 2023. However, its contribution of 11% to the company’s total sales is much smaller than 56% for its Google search business. The core search business is also doing well, with the company’s AI integration helping it to garner higher advertising revenues, a trend expected to continue in the near term. Looking at the latest quarter, Google’s revenue of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did the company see strong revenue growth, its profitability has improved. Alphabet’s operating income rose 34% from $79 billion in 2021 to $105 billion now. Its operating margin has improved slightly from 30.6% in 2021 to 30.9% in the last twelve months. With 26% gains this year, GOOG stock has fared marginally better than the broader S&P500 index, up 24%. However, the increase in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and Google’s antitrust case, could GOOG face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? From a valuation perspective, we think its stock price appears to be fairly priced. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, broadly aligning with its current levels of $178. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock’s average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 25x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. Now, Google has a monopoly with 90% of searches. The recent argument by prosecutors focused on the company’s search engine – Chrome – which is a widely used browser with over 3 billion users. Chrome is very important for Google, given that it acts as a gateway through which users access the search engine. The web browser alone could be worth as much as $20 billion. [2] Furthermore, the prosecutors stated that Google should share data it gathers from users with competitors. And, if the remedies fail to increase the competition, then Google should consider selling Android. None of these remedies would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term.

Chip giant Nvidia reported its third-quarter earnings earlier today, and all ears—and presumably some watch parties—were tuned in to try to determine what the company’s performance might mean for the near future of the artificial intelligence industry as a whole. The fate of the company’s newest AI chip, Blackwell, was a major focus after production issues caused shipments to be delayed for several months earlier this year. On Sunday, The Information also reported that Blackwell chips were overheating when connected together in Nvidia’s customized server racks, prompting the company to make design changes. But Nvidia cofounder and CEO Jensen Huang told analysts and investors on its earnings call today that Blackwell production now “is in full steam.” “We will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated,” Huang said. Some of Nvidia’s most important customers, like Microsoft and OpenAI, have already received the new chips, and Blackwell sales could end up generating several billion dollars in revenue for the company next quarter, executives said. Some industry analysts reported earlier that problems with the new chips had been fixed. Dylan Patel, chief analyst at the research firm SemiAnalysis, told Business insider that the Blackwell overheating issues “have been present for months and have largely been addressed.” Patrick Moorhead, founder and chief analyst of Moor Insights & Strategy, told WIRED that his manufacturing contacts were unaware of any major overheating issues. But it's not unusual, he said, for there to be tension between design, engineering, and production when bringing a new chip design to market. “It’s a debate as old as semiconductors: Is it a design issue? Is it a production issue?” Moorhead said. “People are going to look for any type of smoke that can get in the way of the thesis of [Nvidia’s] dramatic growth.” Nvidia generated $35.1 billion in revenue for the quarter, beating estimates of $33.2 billion. Its revenue rose 94 percent compared to last year. That’s a relatively small increase compared to a few of its recent quarters, when revenue rose as much as 265 percent on an annual basis—but Nvidia isn’t going out of business anytime soon. The results indicate that the AI market is continuing to boom as companies pour billions of dollars into buying advanced chips and other equipment, albeit at a slightly slower pace. A large portion of Nvidia’s growth this quarter was driven by data center revenue, totaling $30.8 billion for the quarter, which was up 112 percent from last year. The company’s gross profit margin was 74.5 percent, essentially flat from a year ago. But analysts expect that Nvidia’s margins could shrink as the company shifts to producing more Blackwell chips, which cost more to make than their less advanced predecessors. Nvidia’s earnings reports are seen as an important bellwether for the AI industry. The chip architect’s advanced GPUs, which power complex neural network processing, are what made the current generative AI boom possible. As Silicon Valley giants raced to build new chatbots and image-generation tools over the past few years, Nvidia’s revenue exploded, allowing it to surpass Apple as the most valuable public company in the world. Since the launch of ChatGPT in November of 2022, Nvidia’s stock price has increased nearly tenfold. Almost every major tech company working on AI, even those building their own processing units, rely heavily on Nvidia GPUs to train their AI models. Meta, for example, has said that it is building its latest AI technology on a cluster of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100s. Smaller AI startups, meanwhile, have been left without enough AI compute power as Nvidia struggled to keep up with demand. Blackwell, Nvidia’s newest GPU, is made up of two pieces of silicon each equivalent to the size of its previous chip, Hopper, which are combined together into a single component. This design has resulted in a chip that’s supposedly four times faster and with more than double the number of transistors as its predecessor. But the launch of Blackwell hasn’t been all smooth sailing. Originally slated to ship in the second quarter, the new chip hit a production snag, reportedly delaying the rollout by a few months. Huang took responsibility for the problem, calling it a “design flaw” that “caused the yield to be low.” Huang told Reuters in August that Nvidia’s longtime chipmaking partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited, helped Nvidia correct the issue. Moorhead told WIRED he remains bullish on Nvidia and is confident that the generative AI market will continue to grow for at least the next 12 to 18 months, despite some recent reports suggesting AI progress is starting to plateau. “I think the only way shareholders would have a mutiny is if they were concerned about the capital expenditures or the profitability of the hyperscalers,” Moorhead said, referring to big tech companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta that are heavily invested in AI cloud services. “But I think they’re just going to keep buying up Nvidia until that day actually comes.” Enterprise AI is still an area of growth for Nvidia as well, he added. On today’s earnings call, Nvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress said Nvidia’s enterprise AI tools are in “full throttle,” including an operating platform that lets other businesses build their own copilots and AI agents. Customers include Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow, she said. Huang echoed the same thing later in the call: “We’re starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI,” he said. “It’s really the latest rage.”

Nvidia’s stock broke to all-time highs recently, trading at $148 in early November and $147 yesterday. The stock has left many investors wondering “what comes next” after the unrelenting, historic surge that began seven quarters ago. To help my readers determine where Nvidia’s stock will go next, I’ve been fastidious in my analysis about the company’s outsized AI potential since 2018, tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for AI demand since 2022, discussing the anomalous earnings and revenue revisions throughout 2023 and 2024, and reporting on never-before published data on supply chain checks as recent as two months ago. CEO of Nvidia, Jensen Huang, waves during the launch of the supercomputer Gefion at Vilhelm ... [+] Lauritzen Terminal in Kastrup, Denmark, on October 23, 2024. The new AI supercomputer has been established in collaboration with EIFO and NVIDIA and is operated by the Danish Center for AI Innovation (DCAI). The computer is aimed 'at breakthroughs in quantum computing, clean energy, biotechnology and other areas serving Danish society and the world', according to Nvidia. (Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen / Ritzau Scanpix / AFP) / Denmark OUT (Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) The thoroughness is needed, however, as rumors from the media and short sellers alike run amuck. Rest assured, as 2025 approaches, supply chain data is giving bullish signals that the new generation of GPUs shipping in full volume by mid-2025 (and beginning to ship in the January quarter) will far exceed the GPU sales we saw in 2023 and 2024 combined. Regarding my firm’s confidence in tracking supply chain data, when The Information stated Nvidia was experiencing a material delay on the next generation of GPUs, going so far as to state that Taiwan Semiconductor had machines sitting idle, I quickly refuted the report based on supply chain data my firm had been tracking. Those data points continue to indicate Blackwell is ramping. Here is what I stated: “As of now, there’s a disconnect between next fiscal year’s revenue estimates of $167 billion and the $210 billion in GB200s alone expected to ship next year. Perhaps analysts are waiting for signals the supply chain can produce these outsized orders. So far, so good with the signals we see from TSMC and SMCI’s most recent earnings reports. Foxconn commentary helps, as well.” Fast forward two months, and next year’s fiscal estimates stand at $185 billion up from $167 billion; showing no material impact from the delay (quite the opposite). Our firm was also able to use that same supply chain data to buy Nvidia in July/August, for an average cost basis of $109. The I/O Fund’s first trade was at $3.15, but we actively track the stock and publish our real-time trade alerts for anyone who feels they missed out on the AI juggernaut. The first item that will determine the strength of the upcoming earnings report from Nvidia has nothing to do with the Q3 results. Rather, what the market will want to know is how much Blackwell revenue is expected in the January quarter. Morgan Stanley has estimates placed at $5 to $6 billion, with this number hitting a ceiling due to supply constraints; however, Piper Sandler sees Blackwell revenue potentially higher, at $5 billion up to $8 billion. The bigger picture is that Blackwell will ramp by an order of magnitude, eventually exceeding Hopper’s revenue. To quantify this, Hopper has delivered approximately $125 billion in data center revenue since Q1 2023, based on estimates from Trend Force placing Hopper at generating 90% of data center revenue in 2024. Blackwell, on the other hand, is expected to deliver up to $210 billion next year alone, based on estimates for up to 60,000 to 70,000 GB200 NVL72 servers priced up to $3 million each. Given the company is lapping tough comparables, the growth rate will slow considerably even if Blackwell does ramp from $6 billion per quarter to $60 billion per quarter by late-2026 (Hopper is in its seventh quarter and Blackwell will be in its seventh quarter by late 2026). This is because excellence begets excellence, and thus, Nvidia is competing with itself with each new generation of GPUs. For example, with Hopper, the company reported peak quarterly growth of 262% and 265% earlier this year, yet is expected to slow to the mid-40% for growth as we close out 2025. Nvidia has multiple levers it can pull and outside forces at play that will help it maintain this 40%+ growth rate. This includes a 1-year product road map, Big Tech’s large appetite for AI spending, and long-term AI GPU market growth from Enterprises and the Consumer, plus a commanding market share position. By coming to market with upgraded, more powerful GPUs on a now-annual cadence, with Blackwell Ultra, Rubin and Rubin Ultra soon to come, Nvidia will continue to be the largest beneficiary of Big Tech’s AI capex to an unprecedented degree as the company continually raises the bar on performance and TCO upgrades with each new generation. Additionally, Nvidia has a software moat with CUDA and the cash to reserve chip capacity in bulk at the fab level to maintain an 80% to 85% share of what executives foresee as a $500 billion AI accelerator market by 2028. I first covered these points in my free newsletter when I published: “Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap by 2030.” Of these points, one of the most visible is that Nvidia continues to pry away tens of billions in cash – and now hundreds of billions —- from the world’s leading tech companies. All roads lead to Nvidia, and it’s no secret that Big Tech and others are competing to purchase Nvidia’s supply constrained GPUs. Our firm began tracking Big Tech capex as a proxy for Nvidia demand in 2022, and tracking it on a quarterly basis starting in early 2023 – to help gauge AI demand, I continue to track Big Tech capex quarterly closely for our readers. Our recent checks published in the analysis “AI Spending to Exceed a Quarter Trillion Next Year” reveal that AI spending continues to accelerate, with Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta on track to increase their spend by ~$90 billion YoY in 2024. This does not include xAI, CoreWeave, Oracle and dozens of others who are also spending multiple billions on Nvidia’s GPUs, as well. To better understand the trajectory of AI spending, let’s take a step back to 2023, where the rapid ascent of ChatGPT at the beginning of the year set the stage for AI to step into the spotlight. Big Tech could spend another $70 billion in Q4, based on guidance and comments from executives, who overwhelmingly discussed the need for more AI infrastructure, putting full year capex at ~$240 billion, or nearly 15% higher than the level they were tracking at the start of the year. Big Tech’s Q4 capex could hit $70B, driven by AI infrastructure demand—pushing 2024’s total to ... [+] ~$240B, up 15% from early-year estimates! For 2025, Big Tech has already signaled a willingness to spend substantially more on AI. There is clear ROI for Amazon, Google and Microsoft as they rush to meet the elevated demand that continues to outpace AI capacity in their cloud infrastructures. More broadly, Big Tech and large enterprises are racing to further develop and broaden AI services and models. UBS projects Big Tech will spend ~10% more YoY, placing AI-driven capex at $267 billion; however, if 2024 is any sign, this estimate is too low. This all fits in with longer-term projections from Bank of America that sees a cumulative $700 billion spent on AI through 2026. As we go through a lull between the Hopper generation being in its seventh quarter, and Blackwell not yet shipping in volume, our firm will be buying the dips on Nvidia for many reasons – one of them being it’s the market leader on margins. By having a near monopoly on GPUs, Nvidia has incredibly strong pricing power. The GPUs coming in 2025, called Blackwell, are set to intensify this pricing power with DGX B200 systems reportedly going for up to a 40%+ premium to the previous DGX H100 systems, at $500,000 per server versus the low $300,000s per server, respectively. While GB200 prices are estimated at $60,000 to $70,000 for a single chip, the NVL36 and NVL72 configurations carry much higher price tags and thus, higher average prices per GB200. For example, the NVL36 is expected to cost ~$1.8 million, and for 18 GB200s (36 B200 GPUs), that comes out to $100,000 per GB200 and additional components. For the NVL72, it works out to ~$83,333 per GB200 and additional components. While there were concerns about Nvidia’s margins given that management guided for a sequential contraction in gross margins in Q3, the sheer pricing power of Blackwell will ultimately be a non-issue next year. Nvidia’s operating margin of 62% exceeds second place Microsoft by 17.5 points and third place Meta by 21.9 points; Nvidia is more than double the rest of the Mag 7 including Apple and Alphabet. This is because Hopper’s pricing power versus the Ampere generation: Nvidia’s Compute and Networking operating margin expanded from 28.5% in Q3 FY23 when Hopper reached full production to 71.3% in the most recent quarter even as revenue grew 7x during that seven-quarter period. Nvidia leads the MAG 7 with a 62% operating margin, driven by Hopper’s pricing power—more than ... [+] double Apple, Alphabet, and others in the group! Nvidia is expected to report roughly 50 bps to 100 bps margin contraction this quarter compared to last quarter, and will see roughly 200 bps to 300 bps margin contraction from its peak growth quarters earlier this year. As stated, the pricing power I foresee from Blackwell will keep the margins strong well into 2025, therefore, any concerns over margins this quarter will be a moot point by next year. The strong margins combined with the expected growth in AI accelerators has caused some analysts to increase earnings per share substantially as of late. Bank of America increased its EPS estimates for next calendar year from $3.90 to $4.47 and for calendar year 2026 from $4.72 to $5.67. In February, I wrote an analysis describing how Nvidia’s valuation was “eerily low despite 420% rally since 2023” to help our readers prepare for a higher return in the coming months, which detailed the importance of these revisions. Ultimately, these revisions make the stock cheaper as it leads to more room in the bottom-line valuation. Despite being fairly straight forward, the velocity of the revisions is the single most important point that short sellers and Nvidia critics cannot seem to understand. Of all the quarters since Nvidia’s Hopper release, this is the quarter most likely to be lackluster. This is because the impact of Hopper and the H200s are well-known and the Blackwell generation won’t be shipping in volume until Q1 and ramping further into Q2. I am looking forward to the fiscal year guide in the February call, and am even more excited about the May earnings call when Blackwell’s impact will be better understood. Nvidia is expected to report revenue of $32.9 billion for growth of 81.8% at the midpoint. Analyst expectations are higher than management guidance of $32.5 billion at the midpoint, for growth of 79.4%. This is a deceleration from last quarter’s 122.4% growth, and peak growth of 262% and 265% in the April and January 2024 quarters. As pointed out on EPS, another area where Nvidia is unique is the sheer amount of analyst revisions on the stock. It not only speaks to Nvidia’s dominance in the AI data center to continually surprise the Street, but also to the challenge that analysts face in terms of predicting Nvidia’s persistent revenue surge. For example, this year alone, analysts originally expected Nvidia to report 33.4% revenue growth and this quarter is now expected to be 81.8% growth, for revisions that total 48.4 points in about six months’ time (more than double the original growth expectations). This quarter, there is a wide range of expectations with UBS believing Nvidia will beat by as much as $2 billion, for revenue of $34.5 billion to $35 billion for Q3. Piper Sandler foresees a beat of $1.3 billion for Q3, and a beat of $1.5 billion for Q4. It’s been quite clear for the past two years that analysts do not know how to gauge the growth coming from this company. In 2025, Blackwell is likely to wildly exceed analyst estimates again. This quarter, analysts are expecting EPS of $0.74 compared to EPS of $0.67 last quarter. For nearly two years, the company has beaten EPS estimates by 10% or more, yet in the last quarter, the beat was more muted at 5.7%. On the topic of Nvidia having 2X better margins than most of the Mag 7, here is a glimpse of how Nvidia compares on EPS with a 35%+ growth rate compared to the Mag 7 reporting half this growth rate through 2026: Nvidia: 35.5% 2Y revenue CAGR, 35.1% EPS CAGR Apple: 7.1% revenue CAGR, 14.4% EPS CAGR Microsoft: 14.2% revenue CAGR; 14.9% EPS CAGR Amazon: 10.7% revenue CAGR; 22.3% EPS CAGR Meta: 13.5% revenue CAGR; 12.5% EPS CAGR This quarter, Nvidia’s CFO Colette Kress, will not offer a full year guide yet have to address the elephant in the room — supply constraints. The fab that makes Nvidia’s chips, Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC), is working overtime to boost capacity to meet demand. TSMC’s monthly CoWoS capacity was estimated at ~15,000/month at the end of 2023, and was originally expected to triple to ~45,000 to 50,000/month by the end of 2024 in order to meet such high demand from Nvidia, AMD and other advanced node clients. Now, capacity is expected to rise ~300% to 60,000/month. TSMC remains committed to significantly boosting CoWoS capacity over the next few years in order to accommodate these accelerated AI GPU timelines from both Nvidia and AMD, with multiple different product lines expected to come to market over the next couple of years. By year-end 2025, CoWoS capacity is estimated to be 80,000 to 90,000/month, per Morgan Stanley, with Nvidia reportedly already reserving half of this capacity. By the end of 2026, CoWoS capacity is estimated to expand to as much as 140,000 to 150,000/month, representing 10x growth in capacity from the end of 2023. Source: Beth_Kindig xAI Foxconn and Quanta are also both signaling strong demand for Blackwell come 2025. Foxconn has said that they see “crazy” demand for Blackwell servers, and forecast AI servers to make up half of their overall server business in 2025. Foxconn has said that initial shipments are on time for Q4 before ramping much faster in Q1, with Quanta saying the same, that initial shipments are on schedule and will ramp in Q1. Quanta sees triple-digit AI server growth through next year on the back of strong demand, with Deputy Spokesperson Carol Hsu saying that “recent capex guidance from top US hyperscalers also confirmed their aggressive spending on AI in 2025, all from a high base in 2024.” Nvidia is the subject of some of the most severe export restrictions from the US due to its integral role in advancing AI computing. Subsequently, the company’s China exposure is among the lowest in the semiconductor sector, leaving it less exposed should we see heightened geopolitical tensions — especially tariffs. Nvidia’s China revenue was 9.6% in Q1 and 12.2% in Q2, down from the low-20% range in the same quarters in fiscal 2024. For all of FY 2024, Nvidia’s China revenue was 16.9%, down from 21.5% the year prior. Other semi peers are much more heavily exposed to China: Broadcom’s China exposure was 32.2% in FY 2023, Intel’s exposure was above 27%, and Qualcomm and Marvell both had more than 40% of revenue stem from China in FY 2024. Although Nvidia’s fundamentals are a perfect 10, the stock is contending with weak peers, as evidenced by major semiconductor ETFs, SOXX and SMH, not making new highs with the S&P 500. Retail investors often find out the hard way, even the most perfect stock must contend with market forces beyond its control. This is the primary reason Nvidia’s stock may pullback as Nvidia is holding up the semiconductor market, which has grown unusually weak in the past few weeks. SOXX is 20% of its all-time highs and SMH is 14% of its all-time highs despite the S&P 500 making new highs. In a 1-hour webinar for I/O Fund Members last quarter, I discussed why this is an issue for AI investors and what I’d like to see before I resume buying Nvidia. My firm has become well-known for calling Nvidia an AI stock in 2018, and later stating Nvidia would Surpass Apple, and finally that Nvidia will reach a $10 trillion market cap by 2030. Yet, perhaps lesser-known is that I nailed the October 2022 bottom by stating Nvidia was Ready to Rumble on H100 GPUs along with a real-time trade alert for $10.80 on October 13th 2022 a mere 25 months ago. Here is what I stated at the exact moment Nvidia’s stock bottomed in October after selling off 60% following the August earnings report: “Today, Nvidia’s AI products serve nearly every enterprise company’s artificial intelligence and machine learning ambitions. The company has an impressive launch schedule starting in October for two flagship products – the RTX 40 Series and the H100 GPU. The timing of these releases is no coincidence as it’s a rapid two months following the crypto/gaming revenue miss. Suffice to say, Nvidia’s management team is prepared to rumble —- putting its very best release in gaming and its most powerful AI chip to-date up against the crypto mining selloff. If history is any indication, the turnaround will only be a matter of time.” The upcoming earnings report has a few similarities to October of 2022, which is that we are toward the end of a product cycle and the CFO cannot offer fiscal year guidance. Despite the H100s ramping and Nvidia having visibility into that ramp, the CFO was tight-lipped two years ago stating: “Our Data Center yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We’ll continue to look at it.” Therefore, I am not expecting much from the CFO on Blackwell in this report, but that lack of detail will be a distant memory this time next year. Make no mistake, Nvidia is the best stock of the decade and we are only four years in. The big picture is that Nvidia's trajectory will continue due to two words: pricing power. Our firm has an aggressive buy plan at key levels should the stock pullback, and we have a backup plan should the stock overcome the peer pressure we are seeing from SMH and meaningfully breakout.The keyword is “buy” but the skillset is patience. My firm has blended cutting-edge analysis alongside careful, patient buys for returns of 3280% since our first tranche. Most importantly, the I/O Fund continues to offer buy zones for those who’d like to participate. The I/O Fund first called out Nvidia’s AI opportunity in November 2018 with our first trade alert at $3.15 for returns of 3280%. We also provided 9 buy alerts from 2021 – 2022 to buy NVDA stock below $20. The I/O Fund has been closely analyzing lesser-known stocks in AI plus crypto with real-time trade alerts and webinars.

Title: Pulling in top talent: The work perks that really matter

From performance bonuses to babysitting, Deliveroo vouchers to doggy day care, employee benefits packages have got a whole lot more interesting. Big employers use headline-grabbing benefits to position themselves as desirable and to attract top talent. From carpooling to counselling, grocery delivery to co-working hub vouchers, some companies are even offering free babysitting to make sure knackered staff get out on date night. But which perks are worth the most, and how do you make sure you are getting everything available? In addition to salary, good benefits increase an employer’s chance of beating others to the best staff. Some benefits are arguably aimed at a specific demographic only, leaving other applicants cold. This may be a strategy. Would you be persuaded by seemingly generous doggy day-care vouchers and Just Eat delivery? These benefits signal that new hires can expect to be time-poor, unable to commit to mealtimes at home, or to responsibilities outside of work. They are likely to be aimed at attracting those for whom the office can be dominant in their lives — they won’t require being away from it much. If that’s where you are at, then these perks can pay off in the short term. A dog sitter in Dublin city for example is about €25 a day, or about €4,500 a year for someone in the office four days a week. Those travelling for business can expect to pay €35 for overnight dog sitting. If you’re offered food delivery credits as a perk, know that how you use them may be restricted. In October, staff at Meta in the US were fired for eating the meal at home instead of the office. Meta, like many big tech companies, offers free food to employees based out of its Silicon Valley headquarters. Staff in smaller offices without a canteen are offered Uber Eats or Grubhub credits, for example, for food to be delivered to the office. They are given daily allowances of $20 for breakfast, $25 for lunch and $25 for dinner. Employees who were getting the meals sent home when they were required to only eat the food in the office were fired. Some perks leave a bad taste. Less than one per cent of employers offer anything by way of childcare vouchers, says Trayc Keevans of Morgan McKinley survey. What’s the benefit the employees in Ireland most care about? No, it’s not doggy day care that’s really keeping us awake at night, but rather how to pay for our lives once we retire. Pension tops the list of the most desired benefits, according to a survey of 3,400 professionals and 650 employers globally as part of a 2024 report by recruiter Morgan McKinley. “We are seeing employees younger than ever before actually looking at pension,” says Trayc Keevans, Morgan McKinley Ireland’s global foreign direct investment director. “It wasn’t as important before, but in the most recent survey, right across the board, pension was an important benefit,” says Keevans. By 2046, Irish men can expect to live to 85 and women to 89. So if you retire at the current State pension age of 66, you’ll have about 20 years of living after your last pay cheque. [ Has Fingal County Council found a solution to Ireland’s housing crisis?Opens in new window ] If you start to save for retirement at age 30, on a salary of €40,000, you will need to set aside a minimum of 18 per cent of gross salary every year until age 66 to get an income of €2,000 a month in today’s money – and that’s including the State pension, according to Pensions Authority calculations. With parenthood and home ownership happening later than ever, the cost of supporting children and paying a mortgage is now stretching past retirement age. Housing costs mean more people will be renting in retirement too. This is bringing employer pension contributions into sharp focus for employees. Don’t just ask a prospective employer if there’s a pension, ask about the terms, says Keevan. Some are only finding out when it comes to contract signing that the terms are less generous than their current employer. Know the contribution from your current employer at least get that matched, says Keevans. Smaller companies will usually pay pension contributions of between 3 and 6 per cent, matching your contribution, she says. “Standard in a midsize to multinational company would be from 5 per cent matching up to manager level,” says Keevans. “Above that, a company might make contributions of anything up to 10 or 12 per cent. The larger multinationals will go even higher,” she says. “The best pension I have seen was a 19 per cent employer contribution, with the employee being asked to make a contribution of 4 per cent, bringing it up to 23 per cent.” Ask if pension entitlements increase as you climb the ranks. Employer pension contributions nudge up when you reach a certain age in some companies. Knowing this can help inform your job hunting. Paid private health insurance is the second most valued employee benefit, according to the Morgan McKinley research. A separate survey of 1,000 adults by Dooley Insurance Group puts health insurance top of the heap with 56 per cent of employees prioritising it. More than three in 10 of us didn’t go to a healthcare appointment because we could not afford it, according to an Irish Cancer Society survey last month [November]. One in four, meanwhile, felt we must prioritise other costs over healthcare. With the average adult paying €1,685 a year for health insurance, according to the Health Insurance Authority figures, this is a valuable perk for your health and your pocket. “We find at manager level and above, the policy covers the spouse and dependents as well,” says Keevans. Families with two adults and two children can pay up to €5,000 a year for insurance cover. You’ll need to earn about €10,000 to pay for that out of after-tax income. The cost isn’t the only benefit with paid health insurance, but rather access to basic treatment in a reasonable time frame. Almost two-fifths of people put off a medical appointment due to pressures in the system, according to the Irish Cancer Society survey. Working from home takes the third spot as the most valued employee benefit, says Morgan McKinley survey. Remote working was also highly rated by participants in the Dooley Insurances survey, with 35 per cent placing significant value on it. Remote working saves on transport and clothing costs. Coupled with flexible working, it may even enable some households to save on before and after-school care. This can mean significant savings. Only about a fifth of those eligible are claiming the remote work tax credit, according to Revenue figures. The credit for a year averages about €40 to €60, so there’s no boon here. The real pay-off is work-life balance, and job candidates are negotiating hard on this. “If they take a holiday in Spain every year, they might ask to tag on another few weeks and work from there, if that’s permissible,” says Keevans. “They are asking for a ‘work from anywhere’ policy in their contract that would allow them to do that. That’s quite attractive and we’ve seen a lot of people negotiate that.” Companies are still grappling with how many weeks an employee can work out of the country, before triggering tax liabilities there, she says. “Companies are tending to be quite conservative in guesstimating what that will be, the most we have seen is six weeks, but we see a lot of reluctance to it.” Flexibility around working patterns remains a prominent request. “Somebody might be joining a company where the standard is three days a week in the office, but it’s moving to four days. They might negotiate to move it back to three, but that can be difficult in the current climate,” says Keevans. New hires could negotiate an initial period of office time to get to build relationships and understand the culture, with that being reviewed, she says. Who doesn’t love a bonus? If this is part of the package, it’s important to understand what’s on offer. “Is it tied to your personal contribution and meeting personal performance metrics such as sales quotas, project milestones, performance reviews or KPIs? [key performance indicators]” says Keevans. “We see some employers and if the company isn’t performing, there’s no bonus for anyone and if it is performing, then the individual performance piece is cleared for payment,” she says. “The better you perform, the better chance you have of a bonus, but again, it tends to be predicated on the company performing first.” Exceptions to retain top talent can be made, rewarding them even when the company isn’t performing, she says. If a new employer needs you to join pronto, but that means missing out on the bonus at your old job, then negotiate on this. “They may pay you a sign-on bonus to offset what you are losing,” says Keevans. Shares can be great, but only if you know what to do with them. “In most cases, it’s a share purchase scheme that is offered. This is where you can buy shares in the company through salary sacrifice or bonus, usually at a discounted rate,” says David Looney or Alpha Wealth. Typically if these shares are held for three years, you don’t have to pay tax on the benefit, so the only tax due will be capital gains on any increase in their value if sold. Sometimes senior staff are offered stock options or restricted share units. Stock options are where you are allowed to buy a specific amount of shares at a fixed price in the future. If the share price is more than that price at the time you buy, happy days. Options usually have an expiration date, so a perk like this requires ongoing review to assess if it makes sense to buy at a particular time. Share prices can go up and down of course, and things can change quickly. You may benefit from independent financial advice. “We meet clients with little in their pensions, large mortgages and car loans, little in other savings and investments, and then have hundreds of thousands worth of Google stock that they are too afraid to sell,” says David Looney. “You can benefit from tax-free gains of €1,270 a year if selling, previous capital losses can be offset against gains too, but I would encourage anyone with a large amount of shares, six figures, to ignore this and put risk management above tax efficiency,” he says. Selling company stock and investing the proceeds in a more diversified way means all your eggs aren’t in your employer’s basket. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Michael Saylor to present Bitcoin investment strategy to Microsoft’s board

Hit your long-term targets. Earn up to 16% per year on digital assets. Share this article Michael Saylor will share his insights on Bitcoin investment strategies in a three-minute presentation to Microsoft’s board of directors, following a proposal from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR)—who urged Microsoft to consider Bitcoin investment. “The activist that put that proposal together contacted me to present to the board, and I agreed to provide a three-minute presentation,” said MicroStrategy co-founder during an X Spaces event hosted by VanEck. “I’m going to present it to the board of directors.” Saylor has publicly encouraged Microsoft to consider adding Bitcoin to its treasury. He believes it can make “the next trillion dollars” for Microsoft shareholders. Companies like Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Google, and Meta (formerly Facebook) should discuss and evaluate Bitcoin as a potential investment, Saylor suggested, “because they all have huge hordes of cash, and they’re all burning shareholder value.” Microsoft shareholders are scheduled to vote on a proposal to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet on December 10. Top shareholders include major financial institutions like Vanguard Group, BlackRock, State Street, and Fidelity Management & Research. Vanguard, a known crypto skeptic, has also invested in MicroStrategy’s stock (MSTR), as well as shares of other crypto firms like Coinbase and MARA Holdings. As of September 30, the asset management giant reported holding approximately 16 million MSTR shares. MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy has led to huge stock price appreciation, outperforming Microsoft’s stock (MSFT) performance. According to data from Yahoo Finance, MicroStrategy’s stock jumped to a fresh record high at market close on Tuesday. It has skyrocketed 581% so far this year, while Microsoft’s stock has seen around 12% gains over the same timeframe. The NCPPR previously used MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin strategy to persuade Microsoft leadership about Bitcoin buying tactics. They noted that the company’s share price had outperformed Microsoft’s. Microsoft’s board initially recommended voting against the proposal, stating they already “evaluate a wide range of investable assets,” including Bitcoin. While there is interest from certain shareholders, Microsoft’s top priority is artificial intelligence. However, Ethan Peck, deputy director of the NCPPR’s Free Enterprise Project, warned that the assessment could trigger a shareholder lawsuit if they decide not to invest in Bitcoin and the asset’s value subsequently rises.

Title: Lex: Walmart’s cheap goods justify its expensive stock

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. A Walmart in Miami, Florida. The US retail giant reported robust third-quarter results this week. Photo / Getty Images via AFP Lex is the flagship investment column of the Financial Times and has been published since 1945. OPINION It is a rare retailer whose shares trade at a premium to those of Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet. But there are merchants, and then there is Walmart. Operationally, the 800-pound gorilla of American retail is in a class of its own. While others have struggled to entice inflation-weary consumers to open their wallets, comparable sales at Walmart US grew 5.3% during the third quarter. That handily trounced expectations for a 3.7% rise, which is no small feat given Walmart’s size. It pulled in US$648 billion ($1.096 trillion) in revenue last year. Adding to the flex, Walmart upped its full-year guidance for a second time this year. True, the stock itself is no bargain after climbing nearly 64% this year. It trades on a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 33. That beats not only direct rival Target, but also Google parent Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and smartphone supremo Apple, according to financial markets data provider London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG). But this premium is deserved. Walmart has navigated the challenges of a lukewarm economy and inflation with aplomb by drawing in higher income customers and growing alternative revenue streams. It continued to take market shares from rivals in both groceries and general merchandise during the third quarter. Upper-income households making US$100,000 ($169,000) a year or more accounted for about three-quarters of the share gains during that period, the company said. Operating profit is also growing faster than sales thanks to its array of higher-margin side businesses. These include a third-party online marketplace, digital advertising and an Amazon Prime-like membership scheme called Walmart Plus. All these are fast growing and more profitable. This has allowed Walmart to keep prices low on food — and even cut them — to drive traffic and put pressure on rivals. Few other bricks-and-mortar retailers can claim to be able to do the same. Tighter inventory management also contributed to the rise in gross margins during the quarter. A strong dollar and proposed tariff plans touted by President-elect Donald Trump are some of the potential issues that could hurt Walmart. About a fifth of its sales come from outside the United States and the greenback’s rise this year could reduce the value of its non-dollars earnings abroad. But these should be more than manageable. Walmart’s size and diversified business model mean it has managed nearly a decade of uninterrupted like-for-like sales growth. It may not grow as fast as tech, but its prospects do not rely on having to invent whole new business models — and there are fewer regulators with an itch to break it up. Its shares are unlikely to find themselves in the clearance aisles anytime soon. © Financial Times Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. OPINION: Turns out the human brain is not well evolved to handle money.

Title: Stock market today: Dow slides as S&P 500, Nasdaq bounce back from losses after Russia-Ukraine tensions rattle markets

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks recovered from steeper losses in late morning trading on Tuesday as fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine war rattled markets, stealing focus from Nvidia (NVDA) earnings and other corporate results. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.5% but off of the lows of the session. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled to back to trade just above the flatline after the index fell below its election breakout level earlier in the trading day. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) reversed declines to gain around 0.3% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Investors are assessing news that President Vladimir Putin has signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. The changes mean a large-scale aerial attack could prompt a nuclear response, and any attack by a non-nuclear state that is supported by a nuclear power will be viewed as a joint assault. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down 4 basis points to around 4.37%. Gold jumped almost 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rose to trade above $92,400 a token. The geopolitical situation blotted out themes such as corporate earnings, President-elect Trump's cabinet picks, the path of interest rates, and Wall Street's view of where stocks are headed. Meanwhile, the countdown is on to Nvidia earnings on Wednesday, seen as a test of the AI trade that has powered gains on Wall Street. The chipmaker's stock edged higher in premarket trading after getting bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was a tale of two retailers this morning ... Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by 5 cents at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors honed in on continued negative sales growth, despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the "DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand," which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. "Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast," Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. "Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence." US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here. Economic data: Housing starts (October); Building permits (October) Earnings: Lowe's (LOW), Walmart (WMT), XPeng (XPEV) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Wall Street isn't banking on AI to lift stocks any more Nvidia options primed for $300B post-earnings price swing YF columnist Rick Newman: My Trump trade went bust — with a consolation prize Walmart lifts guidance after earnings and revenue beats Goldman sees S&P 500 hitting 6,500 by end of next year DOJ will push Google to sell Chrome to break search monopoly Super Micro stock surges as company files plan to avoid Nasdaq delisting Walmart (WMT) has worked very diligently behind the scenes the past two years to be a major player online. The retailer has expanded its assortment online and has fine-tuned its "buy online, pick up in store" functionality — among other initiatives. The efforts continue to show up on earnings days. Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured, we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman Sachs's chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can toil around on Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note: This explosive shift in rates—in the wrong direction—is a harbinger of trouble as it is a crucial long-term driver of stock returns. The Oracle of Omaha has shed more than 615 million shares of Apple over the last year, and recently took a notable stake in one of America's most well-known consumer-facing businesses. Warren Buffett was a net seller of stocks for the eighth consecutive quarter in Q3. Berkshire initiated new positions in only two stocks in the last quarter. Its biggest addition was 1.28 million shares of pizza franchiser Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ). Stanley Druckenmiller wowed investors year after year with his winning streak at the helm of Duquesne Capital Management. This top investor closed the fund in 2010 but has since continued investing through the Duquesne Family Office -- and one of his favored stocks in recent times has been artificial intelligence (AI) giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Earlier this year, this star investor started cutting his Nvidia holding, and in the third quarter, he sold all of his Nvidia shares. Super Micro Computer met a deadline Monday to avoid delisting from the Nasdaq after delaying prior financial statements. After TLRY hits a 52-week low, we assess whether the current level warrants an opportunity to accumulate shares, hold positions or book profits. Englander's Millennium Management sold close to 4.5 million shares of Palantir and practically tripled its stake in a high-octane electric-vehicle (EV) company in the September-ended quarter. The Oracle of Omaha sets his sights on a prominent brand. MicroStrategy is still holding a lot of Bitcoin. NIO Inc. (NYSE:NIO) shares are trading higher in premarket Tuesday ahead of the company’s upcoming third-quarter financial results, set for release on Wednesday, November 20, before U.S. markets open. Today, the company’s top peer Chinese EV maker XPeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) reported fiscal third-quarter sales growth of 18.4% year-on-year, to 10.10 billion Chinese Yuan ($1.44 billion), topping the analyst consensus estimate of $1.38 billion.

Title: YieldMax ETFs: What They Are And Are They Safe

getty The rapid increase in interest in the stock market since the start of the pandemic has some important by-products. One of those is the rocketing appeal in using options as part of an overall investing strategy. Options are not new, nor are exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have been around for more than 30 years. However, the combination of the ETF product structure, with options driving the performance from within, is entering a golden era of sorts. Enter YieldMax ETFs, a recently-launched product line, launched through a collaboration between Tidal Investments (the advisor) and ZEGA Financial (the sub-advisor). The product line now includes more than 30 funds, just two years after the initial launch of a Tesla-based ETF (YieldMax TSLA Option Income Strategy (TSLY)) on November 22, 2022. At the core of these funds is the idea of taking the price volatility of an underlying stock or set of stocks, and using a strategy known as “credit call spreads” to convert that volatility into a high level of income, modest participation in price upside, and some degree of downside protection. YieldMax ETFs are typically a combination of three investments. First is a backing of the options strategy using U.S. Treasury Bills, which frequently make up more than 80% of the value of the ETF each month, when expiring options are replaced with newer options contracts. The other two investments are a pair of options. Instead of buying the stock outright, as some of its peers do, YieldMax buys call options to act as a surrogate for owning the stock. These are “out of the money” call options, which means that the fund can benefit from some of the future price appreciation, if any, in the target stock. The other option is the sale of a call option, which has a strike price between 0% and 15% of the current stock price. That means that the upside in the stock is limited, but in exchange for giving up that potential return, the shareholder receives a handsome income payout each month. Depending on the ETF and market conditions, Yield Max ETFs will also use other option strategies, such as selling put options. These obligate the holder of the option to buy the underlying stock at a future price that is typically below the price of the stock when the put option is sold. In other words, the investor is receiving cash now in exchange for the risk of being forced to buy the stock later.

Unlock Premium Access — Free For 25 Days. As noted above, the underlying assets are call options (bought and sold) and T-bills. The stock itself is not owned, and does not have to be for the strategy to work. The calls obligate the holder to produce the shares if “called” upon. And the sale of the other call position brings in the income. Income is generated from the sale of the call options, since the investor is sacrificing upside to be paid now. That income and any other cash flow resulting from the T-bills or other assets is delivered to shareholders in a monthly dividend. Expense ratios for these ETFs are typically 0.99% of assets, which gets them just under the 1.00% rate that industry participants often screen for in considering candidates to be sufficiently cost-efficient. But frankly, YieldMax ETFs are a different breed altogether, given their tremendous income-producing potential. The product line also includes several applications of the strategy to more than a single stock, and those have expense ratios slightly above 1.00%. This fairly new line of ETFs has attracted lots of attention during its first two years of existence. That is due to a combination of the popularity of the Magnificent 7 stocks like Nvidia, Microsoft, Tesla and Meta, and the increased demand for income from an ever-growing number of Baby Boomers, who are retiring or shifting from growth toward income in their investment objectives. These ETFs typically yield above their peers, since they aim to spin off option income from single stocks, which are more volatile than indexes (baskets of stocks). There are some YieldMax funds that allocate among stocks, but the most popular so far have been the ones aimed at a single stock. While those stocks can present big risk from lack of diversification, the use of T-bills and options acts as a potential risk modifier. The ETF package is a nice match for the combination of call options known as a call spread. While the elements of these portfolios can be created and managed by investors on their own, there are variables each month based on how volatile the stocks involved and the market happen to be.

So of course there is risk and volatility in the price of these securities. T-bills are considered to be very safe investments, and options are heavily-regulated and in the case of the contracts used by YieldMax, quite liquid. That said, if the fund company’s success reaches the point where they need to resort to private placement options contracts, as has been the case with other ETF producers, that could introduce credit risk. Interest rates impact everything, as does market volatility. The key impact here is the extent to which rates hurt the prices of the underlying stocks, as well as the income available from that large T-bill allocation. Interest rates also may have an impact on the premiums available to bring in as income via the call option sales that drive these products. YieldMax is not a new concept, but it does take the option-driven approach to another level. By applying call spread investing and trading to single stocks, investors who are income-oriented but would like to get a piece of the potential return from lower yield and no yield stocks, can look at YieldMax ETFs as a potential investment. Dividend investing is changing rapidly. Stocks do not yield as much as they used to, thanks in part to rising stock prices and also because company management increasingly back stock instead of using their excess cash flow for dividends. And, short-term bond rates are much higher than a few years ago. That makes YieldMax ETFs an intriguing investment for those who want to complement their traditional approach to income investing. It should come as no surprise that the most popular YieldMax ETFs in terms of assets are those that target single stocks that are very popular. Those include NVDY (YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy), which applies the YieldMax call spread methodology to Nvidia; MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy), which points to MicroStrategy, CONY (YieldMax COIN Option Income Strategy), which is based on Coinbase stock; and TSLY, in which Tesla is the underlying stock. The expense ratio and other fees, though modest for a product line as innovative as this one, is still a consideration for investors. When the yield is flowing and the stocks are holding up, that roughly 1% cost is lost in the profits and income. But in a sustained rough stock market, all costs of investing should get more scrutiny. Start with the idea that when investing, nothing is totally “safe.” But working up from there, the T-bills, options (which commit less money to the stock’s future price movement than buying shares outright) and the oversight of the firms involved here provide a competitive environment for these new ETFs to succeed. The best thing investors can do in considering YieldMax ETFs is to understand the different parts of the fund’s asset allocation, how they work separately and together. Only then can someone determine to what extent, if any, the combination of features, benefits and risks fits for them. Investors seeking to access the underlying stocks and stock baskets these ETFs aim to track, but do with higher expected income, are the most likely candidates to give YieldMax funds a good look. Personally, I own several of them, as a complement to my own dividend stock and income ETF portfolio. That said, I also take the additional step of using hedging mechanisms to buffer my portfolio against severe stock price weakness or other risks cited above. YieldMax ETFs are popular for many good reasons. But with any investment, it is a personal choice, and research and true understanding of what one is buying is the best way to meet your own expectations without risking disappointment. A fund listed on the public market that combines T-bills and options to produce income and upside potential from stocks and stock baskets, many of which do not have high dividend yields. Yes. Tidal investments is involved in many aspects of the ETF business, including product creation, distribution and advisory. YieldMax is one of many ETFs they play a prominent role in creating, marketing and managing. Disclosure: I own several YieldMax funds.

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/18/2024 8:34:03 AM PST by SeekAndFind Donald Trump and the Republican Party made a clean sweep in the US election. Some aspects of Trump’s campaign were a little vague, but we can be fairly certain of lower taxes and deregulation. That, and the strong US economy, should lead to higher corporate profits. On the other hand, the policies he plans to enact could be inflationary, and US government debt doesn’t look like it’s coming down anytime soon. This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January.

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January. Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen. 8 posted on 11/18/2024 9:22:14 AM PST by aklurker [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 7 | View Replies] To: aklurker “Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen.” I know what you mean. We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson This week we are having a look at what a second Trump presidency could mean for investors in the US and elsewhere. What Happened in Markets this Week?Here’s a quick summary of what’s been going on:⛏️ Gold price falls most since 2022 as investors pile into equities ( CNBC )What’s our take?This is a more typical ‘risk on’ reaction.Gold has rallied along with stocks throughout 2024, and the price was up 39% YTD before the election. That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 6 | View Replies] To: ProtectOurFreedom Yeah I retired in 2022, and moved from from about a 70/30 equity/bonds portfolio to about an 80/20 cash/equity portfolio in 2024 (election years presidential & midterms have been where my mutual funds have had negative returns the most in the past). I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January.

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power. Since Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a huge pile of cash, you would effectively be borrowing cash to invest in… cash.On top of that, the funding rate you would effectively be paying would be a hurdle. Unless Berkshire outperforms that funding rate, returns could end up being underwhelming.🏗️ Homebuilder deal activity is surging, fueled by major Japanese buyers ( CNBC )What’s our take?Japanese efficiency could revolutionize the homebuilder market.Record-high housing demand in the U.S. has led to a rush of M&A activity among homebuilders. What’s more interesting is that almost half the deals are with Japanese companies according to Whelan Advisory, which makes sense when you consider Japan’s low-growth environment and low cost of capital.Japanese firms like Sekisui House are making inroads by acquiring major U.S. builders such as MDC Holdings, hoping to bring their advanced value engineering and efficiency techniques to the American market. It’s likely that other Japanese companies will follow suit, which could shake up the homebuilding processes and make housing more affordable through innovations like 3-D imaging and pre-cut materials.📉 US Inflation ticks up while jobless claims fall to lowest in six months ( Reuters )What’s our take?The rate cut journey won’t be all smooth sailing. Expect a few twists and turns along the way.Stubborn inflation and a reduction in first-time unemployment benefit applications are challenging the Federal Reserve's plans for aggressive rate cuts.Economists still expect a rate cut in December, but are now expecting a shallower rate-cutting cycle heading in to 2025. It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements. Don’t expect this to be the last time a tech giant butts heads with EU regulators and has to cough up some cash.🇺🇸 The Trump 2.0 Stock MarketUS equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

That’s unusual, as gold typically outperforms during periods of uncertainty.But gold is also regarded as an inflation hedge. Now that expectations for inflation are rising again, we’ll have to see what that means for the gold price. It’s likely that investors decided to take profits on gold and put that money into more obvious short term trades. If that’s the case they have created an opportunity for gold bulls.🪙 iShares Bitcoin ETF is now bigger than its gold counterpart ( CNBC )What’s our take?This could be a sign of changing tides for cryptocurrencies.Trump’s election win has spurred on a Bitcoin rally as the cryptocurrency surged to new all-time highs. Investors were likely encouraged by expectations that the Trump administration could be crypto-friendly, given Trump himself spoke at the 2024 Bitcoin Conference.The recent surge could also be explained by investors gravitating towards Bitcoin as a hedge against the US dollar, in the event that Trump’s proposed tariffs have an inflationary effect and ultimately devalue the dollar. Interestingly, the US dollar also hit a 1-year high this week.💸 China sells USD bonds in Saudi Arabia ( FT )What’s our take?The USD remains the go-to currency for lenders and borrowers alike.An auction of $2 billion worth of government bonds by the Chinese Finance Ministry was 20 times oversubscribed. The 3 and 5-year bonds were sold with yields only slightly higher than equivalent US treasuries. That could mean investors believe the credit quality of both nations is the same - or that investors are happy with a little more diversification.China usually holds bond auctions in Hong Kong but held this one in Saudi Arabia for the first time. This could be an effort to build closer ties with investors in the country.This bond issue was tiny compared to China’s overall funding program. But the strong demand shows that appetite for USD denominated bonds is as strong as ever.💰 Buffett’s Berkshire Is Being Packaged Into a Leveraged ETF ( Bloomberg )What’s our take?The Sage of Omaha probably wouldn’t approve.When you buy a leveraged instrument, you are effectively borrowing money to increase buying power.

It’s expected that tariffs from President-elect Trump's incoming administration will add upward pressure on inflation and complicate the Fed's decision-making process.In our view, the Fed is likely to opt for fewer rate cuts in 2025 than previously projected, carefully balancing the risks of persistent inflation against the need to support economic growth.⚖️ Meta hit with €797 million EU fine for breaking antitrust rules ( Fortune )What’s our take?Big tech income statements need a new line item: ‘EU Fines’The EU's hefty €797 million fine against Meta for antitrust violations is a huge escalation in regulatory scrutiny over Big Tech's market practices.Meta's defense - that users engage with Facebook Marketplace by choice and not compulsion - seems to overlook the EU's concern about automatic access potentially stifling competition, particularly among competitors that advertise on Meta’s platforms.EU regulators are well armed in their fight against Big Tech, with major twin laws, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, that carry massive financial penalties in the event of infringements.

US equities rallied when it became clear that Donald Trump would be returning to the White House. The market’s response was in part a relief rally after the outcome became clear early on, but some sectors certainly began to price in Trump’s pro-business stance. US Market Sector Performance 6th to 14th November - Simply Wall St As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Free Republic Browse · Search General/Chat Topics · Post Article FreeRepublic, LLC, PO BOX 9771, FRESNO, CA 93794 FreeRepublic.com is powered by software copyright 2000-2008 John Robinson As we’ve mentioned previously, elections tend to have less impact on the overall economy and stock market than leaders like to think. But, this election could be more consequential than usual for a few reasons:The result gave Donald Trump a clear mandate to govern.His campaign platform included some promises that are far more radical than prior elections.The GOP controls the White House, the Senate and the House. This will make it easier to pass legislation without votes from Democrats.This isn’t his first rodeo. Donald Trump hasn’t wasted any time nominating people for key roles, and he appears to have a plan to hit the ground running on day one.In short, the market appears to be anticipating higher growth, along with higher inflation and interest rates. The way things actually play out will depend on if, when, and how his policies are implemented.📈 Inflation and Interest RatesIn the run-up to the election, investors were aware that a Trump Presidency could lead to a rebound in inflation. The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The yield on 10-year treasuries rose as Trump’s poll numbers and the odds on betting platforms rose. This also occurred after the Fed cut rates by 50 basis points. US 10-year yields, US index and Trump Betting Odds - Finbold Two of Donald Trump’s biggest election promises were the mass deportation of illegal immigrants and tariffs on imports to the US. Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Both would probably be inflationary, depending on how or when they are implemented.💱 TariffsTrump has pledged to impose a 10% tariff on all imports, and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Tariffs would result in higher prices for US businesses and consumers. Tariffs would also incentivize local manufacturing, but it’s unlikely that prices would be competitive with low-cost manufacturing hubs, even with the tariff.Import duties result in a one-time increase in inflation, but inflation tends to ripple through the entire economy. The inflationary effect could also be offset - or amplified - by whatever happens to energy prices and the USD at the time.✨ A new round of tariffs could also result in trade partners responding with tariffs of their own. That would hurt US exporters - but could also lead to new trade deals being negotiated.🛫 Mass DeportationsIt’s estimated that there are 10 million or more undocumented immigrants in the US, many of whom are part of the labor force. Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies.

The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy.

The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks.

Plans to deport these people at a time when the unemployment rate is historically low could result in a labor shortage. That would be good news for US workers, particularly those in low-paying jobs.However, it would also be inflationary, and could leave companies struggling to replace workers.The sectors that would be most affected include hospitality , construction , and agriculture where most undocumented immigrants work.In the case of both tariffs and deportations, the impact will depend on how far and how fast the administration implements these policies. The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. 9 posted on 11/18/2024 9:49:48 AM PST by ProtectOurFreedom (Republicans are the party that says ‘Government doesn’t work.’ Then they get elected and prove it.)

The market will probably be quick to react, in which case implementation may be reassessed.Which companies would be shielded or benefit from these policies? Companies with little exposure to imports, and those that benefit from higher interest rates. would be best positioned. This includes smaller companies, banks and technology companies.✨ On the losing side of the equation, the valuations on growth stocks with high multiples and little to no earnings may need to adjust to higher discount rates.💰 Tax Cuts and DeficitsThe US national debt used to be a big talking point for politicians. The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: Bon of Babble Perhaps the most contentious aspect of Trump’s economic policy was his approach to trade, particularly with China. The imposition of tariffs led to increased costs for businesses reliant on global supply chains and created uncertainty in the markets. However, many investors saw these moves as part of a broader strategy to level the playing field for American businesses. Add it all up, and this mix of lower taxes, lower regulatory burden, and America-first dynamics were a boon for corporate profits, which drive stocks. The market roared higher during Trump’s 1st term. Even when the pandemic hit, Trump’s combination of aggressive stimulus along with the Fed’s extraordinary actions resulted in a rapid recovery. 3 posted on 11/18/2024 8:43:49 AM PST by SeekAndFind [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 2 | View Replies] To: SeekAndFind Lower regulations, simplified approvals, govt not making itself the center of all R&D and business activity and America First industrial and trade policies = Tech and US Economy increase way beyond (those taking foreign bribes to hold it back) can limit it. 4 posted on 11/18/2024 8:49:38 AM PST by Justa (Our constitution was made only for a moral and religious people....)

Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

The topic barely came up during this election cycle, and it looks like it will be a problem for the winner of the 2028 election to deal with.Tax cuts were another key part of Trump’s campaign. He intends to extend the tax cuts he made in 2017 which are due to expire at the end of 2025. He has also pledged to make other tax cuts for individuals and businesses.With Republicans in control of both branches of Congress, there should be little resistance to these extensions and new tax cuts. That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy.

That means the budget deficit will widen unless corresponding spending cuts are made. US Deficit Forecast with and Without Tax Cut Extension - Julius Baer Trump has also pledged to cut wasteful and unnecessary spending, but it's unlikely that spending cuts will offset lower tax rates. So unless corporate profits and incomes rise enough to offset the lower tax rates, US government debt is going to continue to rise.Higher deficits mean more supply in the bond market (i.e. higher yields), and rising inflation expectations also mean higher yields. Let’s hope there’s still an appetite for those bonds.⚡ EnergyIt’s no surprise to see Trump pledging to drill, drill, drill, and increase US oil and gas production. OPEC members can’t be happy about that as they cut production to support the price.Oil and gas stocks responded positively to Trump’s win, but we will have to see how it actually translates to profits. More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy. We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment. By staggering your buys and sells, you take trying to ‘time the market’ off the table, and you can adjust your plan if necessary.There are some sectors and industries that we haven't mentioned here, including healthcare and defense. Right now, there isn’t a lot of clarity on what Trump’s second term could mean for those sectors. The potential impact of deregulation will also depend on who ultimately gets appointed to key positions. We will do a follow-up in the new year if, or when, there is more clarity.

More supply would result in lower oil and gas prices, and the largest oil producers are currently aiming to be leaner and more profitable, rather than as big as possible.Still, it’s probably inevitable that new investments in production and refining capacity will be made. This could be good news for oil and gas service companies - have a look at this Oil and Gas screener for some ideas in that space.It’s also no surprise to see renewable energy stocks on the back foot. Trump isn’t a fan of wind or solar, and he’s also pledged to unwind the Inflation Reduction Act which makes funding and tax credits available for clean energy production. Ending this legislation may be tricky, as some of its programs are popular and have created jobs.Regardless of what happens to the IRA, it's probably safe to say that there won’t be many new incentives for solar and wind energy.

He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome.

We will have to see what happens to tax credits for EVs now that Elon Musk is an advisor to the incoming administration. Early reports seem to indicate that the Trump administration wants to kill off the EV tax credits , which is interesting, as that’d actually impact American EV manufacturers more than it would foreign competitors.Solar and wind projects have already reached a point where subsidizing them was becoming too expensive. It’s now a question of market dynamics. Some of the leading solar panel manufacturers have already moved production to the US - which means tariffs on Chinese imports help them.Solar stocks have been among the worst performers of 2024 - at some point the price might be right.The re-emerging nuclear energy industry could benefit during the Trump presidency. Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia. US Trade Deficits with Leading Trade Partners - VoronoiApp What happens now will depend on the next round of tariffs. If a 60% duty is imposed on China, with just 10% on imports from elsewhere, it could be a positive for countries like Mexico. If tariffs are equal across the board it’ll probably hurt a lot of global business.✨ Emerging economies are also contending with a strong USD (which makes their imports more expensive) and the prospects of higher rates. This is happening just as those countries were hoping for lower rates and increasing demand.Trump’s election is ushering in another round of de-globalization. That means companies and countries with less dependence on US trade may be better off. India is one country that stands out, as it’s less exposed to US trade and has a growing local economy. Elsewhere, companies with a local focus like banks, retailers, and food producers should be less exposed.💡 The Insight: Expect The UnexpectedAs mentioned, this could be one of the more consequential elections for the US economy and for the global economy. But market forces sometimes get in the way of policy implementation.For investors, it’s worth treading cautiously rather than assuming any particular outcome. The higher for longer scenario for inflation and interest rates seems likely - but the outlook for cryptocurrencies, energy and other parts of the economy could be quite fluid.Dollar-cost averaging is a good way to approach a changing market environment.

Trump is in favor of nuclear - and of deregulation. This is a key point as nuclear projects face regulatory hurdles - many of which have nothing to do with safety. Amazon’s proposed deal with Talen Energy was recently blocked by regulators. Be sure to check out our screener for US Nuclear stocks that could be big winners with greater deregulation. 🪙 The Bitcoin PresidentAfter previously calling Bitcoin a scam, Donald Trump has now embraced the world of cryptocurrencies. He’s hinted at building a strategic reserve of 1 million Bitcoin. The US government already controls 200,000 Bitcoin which were confiscated from Silk Road, so that leaves another 800,000 which is most of what's left to be mined.Building up a reserve like that would probably force other countries, or their central banks, to do the same. But they would also need to accept the potential volatility and work out how to fund those purchases.For the rest of the crypto industry, a more accommodating stance would also be very welcome. The lack of clear policies and regulations is holding the industry back as much as it’s preventing wider adoption. Proper regulation would allow traditional assets to be tokenized, and bring cryptocurrencies into the mainstream financial system.How far Trump plans to go isn’t clear yet - but there could be big changes on the horizon. 🌏 The Global EconomyTrump’s first trade war with China resulted in less trade between the two countries, but it also led to more trade with other partners, and particularly with other low-cost manufacturing hubs like Mexico, Vietnam, and Indonesia.

I moved most of my portfolio into cash the last few years under Biden: Money Markets, CD’s, short term US Treasuries. Since Trump won I have been slowly moving some of it back into 2 mutual funds(tech/large cap) that have done well for me long term. We are both retired (me 8 years, my wife 3 years) and have kept about 55% in equities. It’s been unnerving to ride the ups and downs, but it’s really paid off for us. My financial advisor and I frequently discuss when to trim equities, but the cash returns have been terrible. Yeah I retired in 2022, and moved from from about a 70/30 equity/bonds portfolio to about an 80/20 cash/equity portfolio in 2024 (election years presidential & midterms have been where my mutual funds have had negative returns the most in the past). I have been buying back into my funds on market down days like last Friday, but still with some trepidation. I am at a 65/35 cash/equity split now, and will work towards a 50/50 split as Trump takes office in January. Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen. “Still leery of a black swan event, and with Biden’s OK for Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia, who knows what will happen.” I know what you mean. We’ve had so many financial crises (2008 real estate, Asian) but we’ve weathered them. I bailed out of equities when the Internet bubble popped in 2000 (was it 2001? ‘02?) and it took me a while to get back in, so I missed the huge run-up when the market got back to normal. So, since then, it’s been steady as she goes. bump for later Disclaimer: Opinions posted on Free Republic are those of the individual posters and do not necessarily represent the opinion of Free Republic or its management.

Title: Jarden Wealth Weekly: Dissecting the Trump trades

US President-elect Donald Trump. Photo / Getty Images Felix Fok is a chartered financial analyst at Jarden. OPINION Markets, by nature, are forward-looking, though they can occasionally get ahead of themselves. Following the recent United States election, stocks, bonds and currencies (crypto or otherwise) have moved in anticipation of what a second Donald Trump term could bring. Certain investments have been dubbed “Trump trades” due to their anticipated gains. However, the question remains: Do all these assets truly merit their upward momentum? The most direct link to Trump himself is Trump Media and Technology Group (DJT), a US$6.6 billion ($11.2b) enterprise majority-owned by Trump. This company, operating the social media platform Truth Social, forms a significant part of his wealth. While the digital advertising landscape remains favourable where companies like Meta, Alphabet, Bytedance, and X (formerly Twitter) have effectively leveraged — DJT’s fundamentals are weak. Last quarter, DJT reported just US$1 million in revenue and a net loss of US$19m. Additionally, they saw a 20% increase in shares, diluting existing shareholder value. Nonetheless, DJT’s market value has surged 70% this year, likely fuelled by speculation of a possible partnership with the Elon Musk-controlled X. Notably, DJT shares declined after the election win, underscoring the mixed market sentiment towards this stock. Tesla and Musk’s political leverage: Musk’s public alignment with the Republican campaign has proven beneficial. Tesla shares have rallied significantly post-election, benefitting from political factors and a rebound in profit margins in the last quarter. Musk’s new role as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (the “Doge”) grants him influence, though it’s unclear how this position will directly benefit electric vehicle (EV) sales. Musk’s political proximity could translate into ongoing incentives for EV adoption, government contracts, or lenient regulations for autonomous vehicle trials. However, the Biden-era US$7500 per car EV tax credit looks set to end based on early indications from Trump’s transition team. This would be a negative for Tesla in the near term until weaker EV competitors exit the market. Given that half of Tesla’s revenue is generated outside the US with 23% coming from China, the Shanghai manufacturing base may provide some protection against US-China tensions. Yet, broad-based trade tariffs could slow Tesla’s global growth and reduce demand for premium consumer products. Ultimately, while having the President-elect’s ear is valuable, the potential benefits may be more significant for Musk’s other (unlisted) ventures, particularly SpaceX, and with this, there could be a shift in Musk’s attention within his businesses going forward. Cryptocurrency rally and the appeal of Bitcoin: Trump’s vow to establish the US as the “crypto capital of the planet” has fuelled optimism within the cryptocurrency market, with many expecting the appointment of a pro-crypto regulator at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite ongoing debates over crypto’s utility and associated risks, bitcoin’s performance can be distilled to supply and demand dynamics. Unlike DJT shares, bitcoin supply is limited by its programming, and the available supply is likely much less than stated due to early misplacing of passwords and dormant accounts. As the first cryptocurrency, bitcoin has withstood major downturns and forks (the spawning of copycat coins) over the past 15 years, and it now stands at an all-time high. Demand tends to follow price momentum, with more investors buying in as prices rise. In high-inflation environments, such as in some developing countries, there is demand for bitcoin as a digital “store of value” alternative to government-issued currencies. Although remote, a US strategic bitcoin reserve remains a blue-sky scenario, making bitcoin a highly asymmetric yet risky proposition. Domestic resilience: In the broader context, the US economy has shown resilience. Employment remains strong, with the unemployment rate in the low 4% range, and property prices have risen moderately. Domestic banks and financial services companies may gain from tax cuts, deregulation, and other policies aimed at economic growth while remaining somewhat insulated from trade tariffs and policies affecting undocumented workers. Increased government spending and domestic investment could keep interest rates higher than anticipated, supporting banks’ interest income. Additional domestic sectors, such as private prisons and transportation, may also benefit, as will the US dollar. However, certain companies may face headwinds from potential labour shortages or declining commodity prices if global growth stalls amid rising supply. Large US multinationals, particularly those with significant US cost bases, may see a mixed impact through higher US dollar and weaker global markets. Risk vs opportunity: Given the uncertainty around timing and impact, investors likely have not fully repositioned portfolios for this new landscape, leaving further upside in some Trump trades if policies and execution materialise. Ultimately, not all Trump trades are created equal: some are grounded in stronger fundamentals, while others may be fuelled by sentiment alone. Investors must weigh how much of the anticipated benefit is already priced in. In the months ahead, attention will naturally shift to cabinet and committee nominations, policy details, and a clearer assessment of value. Buyer beware.

Title: S&P To Crash More Than 40%?

Traders work on the floor during the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange on March 9, 2020 in ... [+] New York. - Trading on Wall Street was temporarily halted early March 9, 2020 as US stocks joined a global rout on crashing oil prices and mounting worries over the coronavirus.The suspension was triggered after the S&P 500's losses hit seven percent. Near 1340 GMT, the broad-based index was down more than 200 points at 2,764.21. (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY / AFP) (Photo by TIMOTHY A. CLARY/AFP via Getty Images) The Federal Reserve and Chair Jerome Powell all but finalized a decision last week - interest rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed’s December meeting. Inflation risk isn’t gone yet. Chair Powell’s Fed likely sees inflation as a real risk - no, a massive threat due to the possibility of persistent, sticky inflation - like the one that resulted in an almost 50% drop in S&P 500 from 1972 to 1974 (see Market Crashes Compared). Giants like Nvidia can drop even more. How much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $45 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $20 trillion in value. And you thought the $2 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first three days of August was bad. To make matters worse, persistent inflation combined with high interest rates hurt smaller companies the most - magnifying the impact on the Russell 2000 small cap index. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?) There are three ingredients: tariffs, deportations, and low taxes. In combination, this is a combustible mixture that would make it difficult for the Fed to fight an inflation spike in coming months, and running into 2025 as the Trump presidency kicks off. Of course, Trump might not implement policies around tariffs, deportations, and lower taxes that he promised. Or, let’s hope they’re not as severe as he’s promised on the campaign trail. But if he does, inflation will potentially head north in a hurry. The rules are simple. Higher tariffs would take cheaper goods out of the market. Prices would rise. Mass deportations of immigrants in the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except it’ll make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. Now while tariffs and deportations constrain supply of goods and services to increase prices - reduction in taxes makes more cash available. So people can spend more while prices are higher. High consumer willingness to pay will lead to higher prices - fueling yet higher expectations for prices. The result would be spiking inflation. The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook that it never got a chance to really put away: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings, a risk-free investment - won’t you demand a higher earnings and return from stocks as well? Of course. There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that Nvidia had lost more than 50% in 2022 alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?), and trillions had been wiped from the market cap of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta with each tech giant seeing a drop of 40% or more. Smaller firms, with less cash on their balance sheets did even worse. The difference is, in 2022 inflation was brought under control. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together are likely to prove a stronger force - a more persistent force. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. And a higher interest rate on Treasury securities only means even higher interest payments. The last thing investor sentiments can take during weak market conditions is a possibility of the U.S. defaulting on its debt. Things could unravel very quickly under such a situation. Market crashes typically happen because someone can’t pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while. Covid-19’s work-from-home gift was a big curse for the retail and office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break - especially if the Fed is forced to hike interest rates. And then, there are consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPMorgan, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). This isn’t going to end well. When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell rack design reportedly faces overheating, potentially delaying shipments

Credit: Bloomberg Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs, already delayed to market, are reportedly facing severe overheating issues in high-capacity server racks, raising concerns over deployment timelines. Nvidia has requested suppliers to revise rack designs as concerns mount among data center operators over delayed Blackwell shipments amid AI accelerator shortages. Overheating issues for Nvidia's high-power NVL72 racks Bloomberg, Reuters, and Tom's Hardware, citing The Information, report that Nvidia's NVL72 racks—housing up to 72 Blackwell chips for AI and HPC—face severe overheating issues. These racks consume 120 kW per unit, risking performance degradation and hardware damage. The NVL72 rack, featuring 36 Grace CPUs and 72 Blackwell GPUs, weighs 1.5 tons and consumes up to 132 kW—setting a record for single-server power usage, Businesskorea reports. The overheating problem has reportedly raised customer concerns over disruptions to next-generation AI data center deployments. Nvidia employees, suppliers, and customers have confirmed the issue. Nvidia has requested design changes from suppliers but has not disclosed the names involved. Nvidia downplayed the issue. "Nvidia is working with leading cloud service providers as an integral part of our engineering team and process," an Nvidia spokesperson told Reuters. "The engineering iterations are normal and expected." Blackwell delays: Challenges for Nvidia's 2025 prospects Announced in March 2024 as the successor to the H100 GPUs, Blackwell promises 30x performance gains and up to 25% energy savings on select workloads. Originally set for shipment in late 2024, Blackwell's launch was delayed to early 2025 due to design flaws. These setbacks could disrupt AI data center plans for key clients like Meta, Google, and Microsoft while challenging Nvidia's AI hardware dominance. Analysts stress that Blackwell's success is vital to Nvidia's market leadership, with technical fixes and timely delivery being top priorities. This has led some Wall Street firms to take a more cautious view of Nvidia's 2025 outlook. Wccftech reports that Morgan Stanley initially projected Nvidia would ship up to 450,000 Blackwell GPUs in the fourth quarter of 2024, rising to 700,000–800,000 units in the first quarter of 2025. Raymond James, however, has revised its fourth-quarter estimate to just 100,000 units but remains optimistic about 2025, anticipating strong full-year demand for Blackwell GPUs. The investment bank Jefferies has cautioned that despite Nvidia's strong recent performance, market expectations for its future revenue and profit might be overly ambitious. The bank estimates Nvidia will ship around 6 million GPUs in 2025, below market forecasts. It also projects data center revenue of US$180 billion to US$200 billion, lower than the market average of US$205 billion to US$215 billion. Financial risks amid Blackwell's uncertainty It is still unclear if overheating issues will delay Blackwell's early 2025 launch, but Nvidia has significant stakes in getting it right. Each GB200 Grace Blackwell superchip costs up to US$70,000, while a complete server rack exceeds US$3 million. Nvidia aims to sell 60,000–70,000 servers, making further delays costly for a company now among the world's most valuable due to its dominance in AI. SiliconANGLE cites Holger Mueller of Constellation Research, who stresses that cooling is vital for AI platforms as high-powered chips risk damage at elevated temperatures. Nvidia has acknowledged the issue but has not clarified its severity. "The questions are how expensive will this be to fix, and how long will it take?" Mueller said. "Blackwell is by far the most compelling platform for generative AI, so customers have no choice but to sit tight and wait for a fix. The duration of that wait will determine if there's any impact on Nvidia's sky-high stock price." Mueller added that Blackwell remains the most compelling generative AI platform, leaving customers no choice but to wait. The length of that wait could affect Nvidia's stock price.
