March 13, 2025 13:05 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=135538&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: An early TikTok investor is $17 billion richer this year, making him the wealthiest man in finance after Warren Buffett

Many of the world's wealthiest people have taken heavy blows to their personal fortunes this year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else. Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In contrast, Elon Musk has had $113 billion wiped off his net worth as Tesla stock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle's Larry Ellison, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer have each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too. Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a $13.4 billion rise this year. The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. He still owns about 7% of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported. Moreover, ByteDance investors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year. Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from the US leader's decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns. Trump said last year that banning TikTok would make young Americans "go crazy," and he didn't want Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place. Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list. Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 months playing poker before becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm. Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament. Managers also use strategy games to teach lessons to new employees.

Title: Trump threatens retaliatory 200% tariff on European wine after EU proposes American whiskey tariff

WEATHER ALERT Aamer Madhani Associated Press Published: March 13, 2025 at 8:39 AM Updated: March 13, 2025 at 4:50 PM Aamer Madhani Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Toronto residents Douglas Bloomfield, left, and his son Phoenix, right, who are on vacation in Washington, hold a Canadian flag and an ice hockey stick to show their support for Canada regarding trade tariffs as they pose with with another visitor to the city wearing a mask of President Donald Trump in front of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU. Recommended Videos But Trump, in a morning social media post, vowed a new escalation in his trade war if the EU goes forward with the planned 50% tax on American whiskey. “If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump wrote. “This will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday that the EU trade commissioner would be having a phone call Friday with his U.S. counterpart. “We don’t like tariffs because we think tariffs are taxes and they are bad for business and they are bad for consumers," she said. "We have always said at the same time that we will defend our interests. We’ve said it, and we’ve shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations.” The U.S. president has defined his opening weeks in the White House with near daily drama regarding tariffs, saying that taxing imports might cause some economic pain but would eventually lead to more domestic manufacturing and greater respect for America. The S&P 500 stock index fell 1.4% on Thursday, while European alcohol stocks also tumbled. But with the EU and Trump now tussling over alcohol tariffs, the impact of a trade war could surface directly in ways consumers could quickly see. It's unclear how the import taxes would be absorbed among vintners, distillers, brewers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Because of Trump's threat, a previously untariffed $15 bottle of Italian Prosecco could possibly increase in price to $45. Similarly, Europe's response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs means that the cost of a 30-euro bottle of bourbon in Paris could increase to 45 euros. Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, said before Trump threatened the tariffs on European alcohol, the spirits industry was already reeling from layoff announcements in the Kentucky Bourbon sector and the tariffs planned by the EU on American spirits. “This ongoing tariff war doesn’t just harm importers — it weakens domestic brands, disrupts distributors, and squeezes retailers who rely on global selections,” she said. “In the end, consumers will bear the brunt of it all." Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be “a hammer blow” for the sector. He said the U.S. market is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually for French exporters of wines and spirits. “Not a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,” Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press. “With 200% duties, there is no more market.” As of now, Europe seems unwilling to back down. “Trump is escalating the trade war he has chosen,” Laurent Saint-Martin, the French delegate minister for foreign trade, said on X. “France, together with the European Commission and our partners, is determined to fight back. We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.” Trump's latest tariff threats suggested that even companies that have publicly stood by him could be collateral damage, raising questions about whether the wider business community would be willing to openly challenge a series of trade wars that have hurt the stock market and scared consumers who worry about inflation worsening. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury goods company LVMH, attended Trump's inauguration in January. His company's wine and spirits brands, which include Moët & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy, could be subject to the retaliatory tariffs the U.S. president is seeking. The Italy-based Campari Group could also be hurt, after the White House highlighted it at Tuesday's press briefing for possibly opening a U.S. factory. Still, Trump feels aggrieved by the EU, complaining to reporters on Thursday about the lack of U.S. auto sales there as well as the lawsuits and fines filed against Google and Facebook parent Meta. “They are suing all of these companies, and they’re taking billions of dollars out of American companies,” Trump said. “And I guess they’re using it to run Europe or something.” Trump, in announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Wednesday, openly challenged U.S. allies and vowed to take back wealth “stolen” by other countries, and he drew quick retaliation. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging “reciprocal” rates starting on April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was “applying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,” or about $28 billion. Those measures cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday shortly before Trump's announcement that the EU was "prepared for whatever might come, and we have been preparing for over a year.” “We call on the U.S. to immediately revoke the tariffs imposed yesterday, and we want to negotiate to avoid tariffs in the future,” Gill added. "They bring nothing but lose-lose outcomes, and we want to focus on win-win outcomes.” U.S. whiskey makers, meanwhile, encouraged Trump to broker a deal. “We urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector," Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. When Europe responded to Trump's 2018 tariffs with a 25% tax on U.S. whiskey, exports to the EU fell by 20% through 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Trump's separate 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico could put 31,000 jobs at risk in the sector. ___ AP writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Samuel Petrequin and John Leicester in Paris, Mae Anderson, Dee-Ann Durbin and Mike Warren contributed reporting.

Title: How Increasing Global Demand And Competition Are Driving The Edge Revolution
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/13/how-increasing-global-demand-and-competition-are-driving-the-edge-revolution/

Full Content:
ByMark Mahle ByMark Mahle , Forbes Councils Member. Mark Mahle is CEO of NetActuate. The global race is on to build enough edge data centers to keep up with sky-high demand. The worldwide edge data center market is projected to reach $317 billion by 2026, a 107% surge since its $153 billion valuation in 2020, but this number doesn’t tell the whole story. Edge computing and AI are revolutionizing entire industries—from manufacturing and transportation to healthcare and retail—and these developments will likely result in trillions of dollars of true economic impact. U.S. business leaders can’t sit back and wait for the next chapter to unfold. Profound changes, driven by an increased need for computing power, advanced hardware, strategic investments and partnerships, are redrawing the global tech map and making it clear that we need to act now to remain competitive. AI’s exponential growth is only amplifying our need for robust edge infrastructure to support it. Even as AI models become more efficient, there is still unrelenting demand for AI that is better and faster. If a new model promises to perform 10 times more efficiently than the leading model, it won't be long until we want it to run 100 times faster. We're missing the forest for the trees if we think efficiency gains will slow our need for greater computing power. The new era of AI also requires substantial hardware resources. In 2024, Deloitte research estimated that total AI chip sales that year would account for 11% of the $576 billion global market: "Growing from roughly $US50 billion today, the AI chip market is forecasted to reach up to US$400 billion by 2027, though a more conservative estimate is US$110 billion." Nvidia is leading the AI chip market, but the industry is in an ongoing arms race for accelerated hardware performance. Nvidia originally designed its chips to enhance computer graphics, not power AI models, and startups are now creating chips specifically optimized for AI workloads. The power demands of AI are enormous and continue to rise. Due to increasing generative AI usage, "electricity consumption by data centers is forecasted to double to 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030," according to a recent Deloitte study. The tech industry, including giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, is rethinking its approach to meet these growing energy requirements by investing in nuclear technology. Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant that closed in 2019, is reopening after Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation. Nuclear energy must play a critical—and urgent—role in supporting future AI and edge developments. Based on reports from Goldman Sachs Research, “85-90 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030 (relative to 2023). But well less than 10% will be available globally by 2030.” China is executing an ambitious long-term strategy to be the world leader in AI by 2030. AI has the potential to add $600 billion annually to China’s economy. The Chinese government has invested heavily in a multipronged approach to AI and edge infrastructure innovation. China’s focus on AI ecosystem innovation, research and development and supply chain ownership extends all the way to the technology’s basic components, including mining and refining in-demand minerals necessary for building semiconductors. The U.S. tech sector is watching China with justifiable concern: The country’s immense domestic AI footprint is having a global impact. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model similar to ChatGPT called R1 and caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet. Nvidia's stock price dropped 17% in a day before starting to recover the following day. For tech companies in the U.S. and other countries in Europe and emerging markets, this is a pivotal moment. As business leaders, we have the opportunity to respond to China’s growth with both competitive investments and open-market collaboration. Mutually beneficial global partnerships with allies, such as EU countries and India, will allow us to align our interests, share knowledge, innovate and drive business outcomes. We need to stay competitive by building more self-sufficient, resilient supply chains and finding the right balance of technological innovation and regulation. This shift will require substantial collective investments in next-generation hardware, software, training and infrastructure. AI is reshaping every sector, and we are only beginning to realize its true economic value. The decisions we make now will enable our collective ability to flourish on a global scale.

Title: INVESTOR ALERT: Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP); DiCello Levitt LLP Encourages Investors with Losses to Discuss Their Options with Counsel

March 12, 2025 18:45 ET | Source: DiCello Levitt LLP DiCello Levitt LLP SAN DIEGO, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025 (the “Class Period”), charging the Company and certain senior executives with violations of the federal securities laws (collectively, “Defendants”). AppLovin investors have until May 5, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the AppLovin class action lawsuit.

Until a class is certified, you are not represented by counsel unless you retain one. You may select counsel of your choice. Case Allegations AppLovin is a mobile advertising technology business that operates a software-based platform to connect mobile game developers to new users. The Company operates through two segments: Software Platform and Apps. The AppLovin lawsuit alleges that Defendants made false and/or materially misleading statements about AppLovin’s enhanced digital ad platform, AXON 2.0, and its “cutting-edge AI technologies,” including that AXON 2.0 would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In reality, AppLovin was reverse engineering data from Meta Platforms and utilizing manipulative practices to force customers into unknowingly installing apps via a “backdoor installation scheme” which artificially inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, AppLovin’s profit figures. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research published separate short seller reports calling into question the integrity of Axon 2.0 and AppLovin’s ad practices. Specifically, the Fuzzy Panda report stated that Axon 2.0 was simply “a House of Cards” built on fraudulent advertising tactics, including “stealing data from Meta” and “exploiting consumers and their data in ways” that violate Google and Apple’s app store policies. Similarly, the Culper Research report claims AppLovin employs Axon 2.0 “largely as a promotional tool – a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives” and that the Company’s “recent success in mobile gaming stems from the systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users’ phones.” On this news, the price of AppLovin common stock fell $46.06 per share from a closing price of $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to a closing price of $331 per share on January 26, 2025, a decline of 12.21% on heavy volume.

Title: META Stock Headed To $200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/12/meta-stock-headed-to-200/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. META Stock Question: How would you feel if you owned Meta Platforms stock and its value dropped 50%, or even 70%, over the next few months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before – and it could happen again. Meta has shown greater stability so far this year, maintaining share prices similar to those in January, while the NASDAQ index has fallen by approximately 10%. Recently, the stock faced pressure after President Trump’s comments opened the possibility of a recession, thereby increasing investor uncertainty. Furthermore, worries have grown with the introduction of Manus, a new AI assistant from China that is intensifying competition in the sector. Rising economic concerns in the United States, spurred by President Trump’s tariff implementation, are creating an unfavorable market environment. We believe META stock could decline further to levels as low as $200 per share. Here’s why investors should be concerned. The key point is this: during a downturn, META stock could suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that META stock lost over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, could META’s roughly $600 share price drop to below $200 if 2022 were to repeat itself? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios – so if you are seeking upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Although META’s AI investments are yielding higher user engagement, investors were disappointed by the company’s quarterly forecast. Meta continues to make substantial infrastructure investments to support its AI initiatives, with 2025 capital expenditures projected at $60-65 billion. Despite DeepSeek’s AI model potentially reducing computing requirements, Meta’s leadership maintains that significant resources are still necessary to run AI models—justifying continued heavy infrastructure spending. Nevertheless, DeepSeek’s advancements and the recent launch of Manus suggest that powerful AI models might be developed at lower costs, intensifying competition and pressuring Meta to evolve its AI technologies such as Llama. From a macroeconomic standpoint, President Trump’s trade policies may negatively impact META. The administration has doubled Chinese import tariffs from 10% to 20% on top of existing levies, and Trump recently proposed a “25% or higher” tariff on all imported semiconductor chips. These policies could further escalate Meta’s already significant AI infrastructure costs. Moreover, reduced consumer spending due to tariff-induced price hikes might hurt advertising-dependent businesses, potentially undermining Meta’s revenue streams. META stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Although investors are hopeful for a soft landing of the U.S. economy, how severe could the impact be if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • META stock dropped 73.7% from a high of $338.54 on 3 January 2022 to $88.91 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 November 2023 • Subsequently, the stock climbed to a high of $736.67 on 17 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $6o0 • META stock declined by 32.9% from a high of $217.49 on 19 February 2020 to $146.01 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 May 2020 In conclusion, the situation is compounded by the fact that META stock remains expensive; it currently trades at almost 25x trailing earnings, compared to the stock’s average price-to-earnings ratio of 21x over the last three years. While Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years—rising at an average rate of 12.2% over the last 3 years (versus 9.8% for the S&P 500)—this growth could quickly fade if the economy turns for the worse. Considering this slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold onto your META stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $400, $300, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy.

(ABC News: John Gunn) The benchmark ASX 200 share index is closing in on a "correction", a fall of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. Much of the roughly $4 trillion of Australian superannuation balances is invested in shares, here and abroad. Analysts are divided on whether this is a minor correction or may be the start of a bigger share market decline. The Australian share market is now close to what financial market participants call a "technical correction". That is, a fall in the benchmark S&P/ASX200 of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. The index reached that high last month, closing at 8,555. About 12:30pm AEDT it was 7,765 index points. Veteran stockbroker Marcus Padley said the market was not panicking, but nor had it found a bottom or floor yet. "I don't think it's looking particularly precipitous," he told the ABC. "The VIX index," he says, which is recognised as the benchmark gauge of financial market fear, "that spikes when something precipitous is going on". "At the moment it has crept higher, so this looks like a slow motion sell-down," Mr Padley added. Marcus Padley says the market is not panicking, but has not found a floor yet. (ABC News) Putting aside tariff and US economic concerns, Mr Padley said a key catalyst for this share market sell-off was the corporate reporting season in America and Australia, as well as China's threat to America's artificial intelligence dominance. "It's been caused by Deep Seek and the Nvidia [earnings results], and the end of the [corporate reporting] season, and a news void that we've gotten into,” he said. "That has been a catalyst for a loss of sentiment after a two-year bull market." So, when does the market stop falling? "Not sure," Mr Padley responded. "It really depends on the US, it depends on big tech, and big tech has been overpriced." Analysts look at the price to earnings multiples for stocks as a key gauge of whether they are valued fairly in the market. It's a ratio that compares the price of a stock to the company's profits per share. The so-called "magnificent 7" in the US: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla have an average P/E of about 32.7 times (excluding Tesla). "The P/E should probably, based on broader market averages, be around 25 times," Mr Padley said. "So, you can see if we got into a bear market, we could see it 10 per cent lower than this." A bear market is a lengthy sell-down in the share market, taking the index 20 per cent or lower from its peak. That seems to be a possibility according to some market participants. Danielle Ecuyer says the selling on global financial markets relates to the potential for growing trade wars. (Facebook: Shareplicity) Financial markets commentator Danielle Ecuyer from FN Arena said the selling on global financial markets, including Australia, was "absolutely relentless". "Predominantly it relates to the potential for growing trade wars across the world thanks to the tariff policy from the new Trump administration," Ms Ecuyer said. "And clearly uncertainty. Just uncertainty about where the world is heading, Australia's exposure to China, because we don't have a huge trade exposure to the US. "And investors, clearly at the moment, they don't like uncertainty, it feels very risk-off, and they're just taking profits. "Plus, there's uncertainty around whether the US economy is going to slow." Millions of Australians have superannuation, with total savings balances currently worth about $4 trillion. So, what influence could the local and US share market have on those superannuation account balances? Many analysts, such as AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver, are sanguine, given the recent strong run-up in investment returns. "Superannuation funds have had two very good years in terms of returns, and so it's par for the course that you do go through bouts of volatility every so often," he told The Business earlier this week. Kirby Rappell from SuperRatings sought to remind savers that superannuation is a long-term investment. "You can be alert, but you don't need to be alarmed," he told The Business. "If you think about the GFC, during COVID … these blips happen. The key thing is about being able to hold your nerve." However, market analysts warn that the short-term volatility is likely to continue. "The key thing will be, as it always is, earnings growth for the companies here in Australia," Ms Ecuyer said. "And quite frankly the February reporting season wasn't fabulous. "So for our market to buck the trend we'd have to see the earnings outlook not deteriorating and the problem for some companies is that they're actually seeing their exposure to the US, and their North American earnings, starting to come under pressure. "I guess if investors have gone into this period – when markets were at very high, elevated valuations – and they're extremely overweight equities, then clearly they've put themselves at risk of a short-term correction, or more in markets." Marcus Padley warned investors to be wary of the potential for a black swan event, or news that sparks a major, sudden sell-down in stocks globally. "We saw some remarkable volume in some exchange-traded funds called SNAS or Short-NASDAQ. "That happened just before the DeepSeek moment." Earlier this year an update from Chinese tech company Deep Seek presented global markets with an alternative artificial intelligence investment to Nvidia. "So, certainly, there are hedge funds who are out to make money in any circumstance, who take large bets on outcomes that nobody else is aware of," Mr Padley said. "If they do know something, it's not apparent to the rest of us. "[But] I don't see that sort of pre-collapse volume in SNAS or other bearish ETFs at the moment." The prime minister says the United States, if it is a friend, needs to act in a way that reinforces "the fact that we are friends" after the Trump administration confirms no exemptions will be granted to US steel and aluminium tariffs on Australia. Chris Brycki is the CEO of investment firm Stockspot. His firm invests on behalf of mainly younger Australians looking to build their wealth. While not offering any investment advice, he said younger Australians should take a proactive interest in the share market now. "I think for young people in Australia the share market is just a great opportunity to build wealth without needing to invest in property, which most people can't anyway," he argued. "You don't want all your eggs in one basket and just owning Australian shares, or just a few tech companies, you want to own some government bonds as well, because that's an asset that does well when there's a recession. "And if you have a few balancing assets in your portfolio, it can really smooth the bumps in periods like we're seeing now." As for older Australians in or approaching retirement? "There are a few moving parts, but I think the people that have a diversified and well-balanced portfolio – they don't really need to lose any sleep," Mr Brycki added.

Title: If You Think Tesla’s Stock Is Bad, Check Out Trump’s Truth Social

Time Published: 2025-03-11T20:15:53Z

Chris Kleponis/POOL/Abaca/Sipa USA Donald Trump took to Truth Social Monday night to offer support to his most important political ally, promising to buy a “brand new Tesla” as a “show of confidence.” Elon Musk’s electric car company has been rocked by protests in recent weeks, and its share price has fallen by more than 50 percent since its post-election peak in mid-December. But Musk isn’t the only member of the administration with a company that is plummeting in value: Trump’s own business has been suffering, as well. A week before the election last fall, the stock price for Trump Media & Technology Group—which operates Truth Social— spiked to $51.51. But thanks to an unrelenting string of bad news about the company’s business prospects—along with the consequences of Trump’s economic policies, which have sent nearly all stocks plunging—the company’s shares briefly fell below $19 on Tuesday. In some ways, Trump’s business predicament appears more significant than Musk’s. Tesla is confronting steeply declining levels of consumer interest, but it still earns substantial revenue and owns major assets. Truth Social’s financials, by contrast, have since the very beginning been bad—and downright inexplicable for a company that is said to be worth $4 billion (even at the greatly reduced share prices of late). For a company that, in theory, has the eyes of the world on its biggest user, Truth Social had just $3.6 million in revenue in 2024. To put that in context, according to a recent review of fast food restaurant chains, Trump’s entire social media operation had less revenue than the average Chik-Fil-A, Raising Canes, What-a-Burger, or Shake Shack location—and just barely more in sales than your typical McDonald’s. If that’s an odd comparison to make, it’s because it’s almost impossible to compare Truth Social’s revenue to other social media companies—Facebook and Instagram owner Meta booked $164.5 billion in revenue in 2024. That’s about 45,500 times more revenue than Truth Social. Those lousy revenue numbers would suggest that the company’s profitability is also lousy—and that’s absolutely true. In its 2024 year-end filings, Truth Social reported losing more than $400 million. But it’s not just the fact that the company has scant advertising sales and few users. It also seems to be spending money in odd and unhelpful ways—it paid Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., $813,000 (or almost a quarter of its revenue) just for showing up at board meetings. And company CEO Devin Nunes has made at least $6.3 million running the company since 2022, a stunning figure for a firm that is struggling to earn any money. Investors might be able to forgive that pay arrangement if there appeared to be real innovation happening at the company. But in the last month, some of company’s press releases have trumpeted rather mundane accomplishments, including: Since Trump’s Truth Social post Monday, Tesla’s stock has seen a small rebound—up about 4 percent, as of Tuesday afternoon. Truth Social was down slightly for the day. Based on its current price, Trump’s stake in the company is now worth about $3 billion less than it was in October.

Title: Even as US slashes jobs, ‘it is the calm before the storm’, economists warn

An upcoming trade war and more DOGE job cuts will hammer the US economy, economists warn. The first major set of economic reports last week reflect the state of the United States economy during President Donald Trump’s first full month in office. The data reveal a spike in layoffs and slower hiring growth across both the public and private sectors, with looming cuts suggesting larger economic woes in the months ahead. The US economy added 151,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department report, which came out on Friday – well short of economist expectations showing a stall in economic growth. Approximately 7.1 million Americans are currently receiving unemployment benefits compared with 6.5 million this time last year. “I think the real risk here is that if Trump doesn’t reverse course on what he’s doing, it could be his last boring report, which I think would be really damaging to the economy. If you look under the hood, I think we are starting to see pretty foreboding cracks,” Elizabeth Pancotti, the managing director of policy and advocacy at the economic think tank Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. The White House painted an alternative picture. “In one month under President Trump, the American economy is soaring back to greatness after the economic calamity left by Joe Biden,” White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Former President Biden, however, was lauded as leading the best economic recovery in the world following the global economic downturn amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, said that last week’s numbers are probably the best we will get in a while amid looming layoffs and tariff fears. “This is the calm before the storm, before we start to see the fallout in the job market from the trade war and the DOGE cuts, and other economic policies from Trump,” Zandi told Al Jazeera. DOGE is the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by ardent Trump supporter, billionaire Elon Musk. Those concerns, coming on the back of comments that Trump made over the weekend declining to rule out an impending US recession, reverberated through the stock market on Monday when the S&P 500 lost 155.21 points, or 2.69 percent, to end the day at 5,614.99 points. This is the first time it finished below its 200-day moving average – a closely watched support level – since November 2023. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 726.01 points, or 3.99 percent, to 17,470.21 – its biggest single-day decline since September 2022, according to CNN. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 890.63 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.09. There are key indicators that point to this getting worse in the months to come. The index which shows how many people took on part-time work including because they were unable to find full-time work or have had their hours reduced, increased by 460,000 from the month prior, to 4.9 million people. “This is the shortest honeymoon period we’ve ever seen if you are 50 days on the job. He inherited on paper a pretty stable, pretty solid economy and it is already deteriorating after 50 days. I don’t think that that’s ever happened,” Pancotti added. Since Trump took office, DOGE has cut almost 33,000 people across the federal government, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks federal government and tech sector layoffs. Because of ongoing court cases, the official count from the Labor Department is 10,000 jobs. The layoffs include employees at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Park Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Energy, among many other government agencies. The number of public sector cuts is expected to increase as many of the recent DOGE cuts came after the end of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (a division of the Labor Department) reporting period for the month closed. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration announced its plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The president has also called for the dissolution of the Department of Education, even though that can only be done by an act of Congress. The global investment firm Apollo forecasts that when considering federal contractors on top of full-time employees, the federal workforce cuts could account for close to 1 million jobs lost. In last week’s jobs report from the Labor Department, the biggest gains were in the healthcare sector, which added 52,000 jobs. However, looming healthcare cuts could make those gains very short-lived. “If we’re looking at massive Medicaid cuts – we’re already seeing [National Institutes of Health] NIH and health research cuts – Medicare cuts are on the table. All of those really could threaten the sector that is driving a lot of those job gains,” Pancotti continued. The downstream effect has already hit the private sector, which relies on federal funds. A private sector worker in Texas, who spoke to Al Jazeera under the condition of anonymity, said that the company they worked with had clients who were largely dependent on federal funds because of which business had dried up. “We went from having a very busy-looking Q1 of 2025 to having absolutely nothing on the books within about a week of the inauguration,” the source told Al Jazeera. “Now that I am having to not spend any money whatsoever and do nothing but look for jobs, I’m not spending money in the economy. I’m not doing things like making improvements to my house. I would have paid contractors to do that. I’m within a couple of months of paying off the last of my student loans and now those are going to be paused until I find something new. Now, I have to worry if I can make the necessary trip to take my cat to the vet,” the source added. According to data from the Commerce Department, US consumers have cut back on spending for the first time in nearly two years. Others are worried about how they’re going to get by, like Kathlyn Clore who worked in audience engagement at The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a nonprofit that received funding from USAID, until she was recently laid off. A single mom in Hawaii – one of the single most expensive states where the average home price is well over $800,000 – Clore has two kids. “I’m on my own supporting my two kids. It’s just going to make that a lot more difficult to make it through this uncertainty,” Clore told Al Jazeera. “I keep wondering if Donald really thinks about what he’s doing to normal, middle-class people like me who are just trying to make a living and provide for their kids. Why does he want to make my life so much more difficult?” she added. Trump said on Friday: “We’re trying to shrink the government and grow the private sector. That’s what we’ve been doing.” But layoffs in the private sector are also on the rise. The ADP, which tracks non-farm private payrolls added to the US economy over the previous month, showed the economy added 77,000 jobs, which is well short of the 148,000 economists otherwise expected. The leisure and hospitality sector, a notoriously low-paying set of industries, led the gains, adding 41,000 of those jobs. “Policy uncertainty and a slowdown in consumer spending might have led to layoffs or a slowdown in hiring last month,” Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. A separate report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which helps redundant employees find new employment, showed that in February alone, US employers announced job cuts of more than 172,000 – a 245 percent increase from this time last month – the highest jump since July 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. The jump in cuts showed the biggest annual increase since the height of the recession in February 2009. The retail sector led the cuts with a 572 percent increase in cuts across the industry compared with this time last year. The tech sector saw a wave of high-profile layoffs, continuing a theme that began last year. In 2024, the tech industry cut more than 157,000 jobs. Among those who made cuts in the last month include Meta – Facebook and Instagram’s parent company – which laid off 3,600 employees. The news comes only weeks after its CEO donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. Only weeks later, Aerospace giant Blue Origin, which Bezos runs, laid off 1,400 people. Alphabet – Google’s parent company – laid off roughly 100 people in February. It also donated $1m to Trump’s inaugural fund. CEOs of all of those companies attended Trump’s inauguration. Microsoft cut roughly 2,000 people from its workforce. Its CEO met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in January, only days before the inauguration. Other major companies including oil and gas giant Chevron announced pending layoffs last month. It comes as Chevron’s woes are about to get more substantial. The Trump Administration revoked the Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company’s licence to pump Venezuelan oil. Starbucks and Southwest Airlines also announced cuts in recent weeks. Trump’s economic policies, including his back and forth on tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory tariffs, will hinder the US workforce. Trump delayed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2. This is the second time he put in place tariffs and then quickly pulled back. “The trade war is even doing more damage than those kinds of other economic policy steps that are being taken. It’s creating uncertainty for businesses,” Zandi added. One sector that will be immediately impacted by the tariffs on Canada and Mexico is the automotive industry. Major players in the sector have slammed the president’s plans in recent weeks, including Ford CEO Jim Farley who said that the tariffs would “blow a hole” in the automotive industry. Other major players across the manufacturing sector also expect this to get worse. William Oplinger, CEO of Alcoa, one of the largest US aluminium manufacturers, said last month at a conference that the aluminium tariffs could cost the US economy 100,000 jobs. “It does look increasingly like the president is serious and is going to engage in broad-based tariffs in a persistent way. If he does, I do expect other countries to retaliate more or less in kind, and that full-blown trade war is going to do a lot of damage. And if it actually goes down that path, I do think recession risks later in the year, later this spring and summer, are very high,” Zandi continued. Trump has claimed a handful of economic wins in his first weeks in office, including a larger investment from Honda to build more plants, which would ultimately lead to more manufacturing jobs. However, production would not come online until May 2028 – less than a year before Trump’s term is up. Japanese truck maker Isuzu also announced a new plant in South Carolina, which will employ 700 people. But it will begin operations in 2027. Trump also touted a deal with TSMC – a Taiwanese semiconductor chip manufacturer – for a $100bn investment. Negotiations for a deal began well before Trump took office and under the Biden Administration, which pushed the chip maker to increase its initial $6.6bn investment. In February, the Trump Administration touted Apple’s recent $500bn investment commitment as a result of Trump’s policies. In April 2021, when Biden was president, Apple made a comparable commitment. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for clarification. Follow Al Jazeera English:

Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The stakes are high for Tesla

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London while Dan is on parental leave until May. Do you have a bad boss? From the narcissist to the micromanager, experts outlined four types of poor leaders — and shared tips with BI on how to work with each one. In today's big story, with Tesla's stock cut in half, investors want their CEO back. What's on deck Markets: The stock market has a $1 trillion weapon to fight further price declines: stock buybacks. Tech: An Amazon VP who oversaw the company's flagship AI product is leaving. Business: Target's ideological identity crisis is putting its business in peril. But first, Elon Musk seems a little distracted. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The damage is stunning, BI's Matthew Fox writes. Tesla's stock price has plummeted 55% from its mid-December highs, Elon Musk's net worth is down $132 billion this year, and a wave of anti-Tesla vandalism has intensified from graffiti to gunshots and Molotov cocktails; images show the aftermath of a Tesla showroom that was recently shot up after hours. While this has been unfolding, Musk has been in Washington, DC, overseeing DOGE's cost-cutting government overhaul — and Tesla investors aren't thrilled about it. "We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin," one analyst told BI. "It's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else." Musk himself appears to have acknowledged this precarious balancing act. During an interview that aired just yesterday, Musk was asked by Fox Business how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the White House. His response? "With great difficulty." Needless to say, Musk's answer is unlikely to calm investors' nerves. Especially when yesterday alone saw Tesla's stock plunge 15%, its largest single-day drop since 2020. Tesla no longer seems to be part of the so-called Musk trade, with all of its postelection gains now erased. The company's EV sales have been struggling, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. Car sales plummeted in several countries last month, and Wall Street is juggling concerns about Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. Meanwhile, the competition in China is growing stronger. There now may be more riding on Tesla's long-promised cheaper EV, which is supposed to begin production in June at the latest. With Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts told BI the launch was "crucial" and a "necessity." Musk needs to turn more people into Tesla customers. But since he's been in Washington, he's turned some people off the company entirely. An angel investor told BI she's among the cohort of Americans ditching their Teslas over Musk's DOGE initiative. At the same time, "Tesla takedown" protests have sprung up in cities across the US, and some Tesla owners have seen their vehicles vandalized — you can take a closer look here. Meanwhile, one business is booming amid Tesla's woes: An aquarium worker who sells anti-Elon Musk stickers online as a side hustle told BI he had been selling 400 to 500 stickers a day in recent weeks — up from a handful in the past. The stakes are high for the company at the moment, but as Investing.com's Thomas Monteiro told BI: "Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it." 1. The Magnificent 7's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day. All seven tech darlings — Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft — slid deeper into the red Monday, dragging the Nasdaq 100 down 3.8% in its biggest decline since October 2022. The amount of market value wiped out in the index exceeded $1 trillion at lows. The S&P 500, fresh off its worst week in six months thanks to tariff-related uncertainty, lost another 2.7%. 2. The stock market's secret weapon to fighting further price declines. As the stock market struggles, Citi analysts noted it could be a great time for companies to buy back their stock at discounted levels — which has historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to engineer stock gains during lean times. The bank is already expecting more repurchase activity, forecasting $1 trillion in 2025, up 11% from the previous year. 3. Nvidia's sliding stock is currently cheaper than when ChatGPT launched — at least by one metric. Following Monday's market wipeout, the chip giant's P/E ratio dropped to 36.4 times, the lowest since 2019, and is down 30% from its intraday record high. 1. The godfather of DOGE. Behind President Trump's first month back in office lies a sweeping political vision set by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, Thiel argued for the end of all government — even democracy — and for tech entrepreneurs to steer the future. From gutting government agencies to putting a stop to diversity, Trump and his followers are now putting Thiel's vision into practice. 2. Zuck's favorite president. Mark Zuckerberg told an employee in 2014 he thought Andrew Jackson was the greatest US president. The Meta CEO said he admired Jackson for his ruthlessness, and being a populist who "got stuff done," former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, wrote in her recently published memoir, "Careless People." 3. The Amazon VP in charge of its flagship AI product is out. Baskar Sridharan, AWS's VP of AI/ML services, is stepping down a year after joining the company following a major reorg, according to people familiar with the matter. Sridharan oversaw the direction and development of AWS's major AI products, including its main horse in the AI race, Bedrock. 1. How Target went from woke to joke. Target can't figure out what it stands for, particularly when it comes to diversity. That's a bad position for a brand with cultural relevancy baked into the business model. The result is a stock price down 30% this year and an unenviable place at the center of America's culture wars. 2. The Washington Post faces another newsroom shake-up. In an effort to sharpen the Post's mission and cater to new readers' evolving habits, executive editor Matt Murray detailed a substantial newsroom reorganization on Monday. The changes, which include several new leadership roles and reorganized teams, come after owner Jeff Bezos overhauled the paper's opinion pages last month. Read the memo Murray sent to WaPo staff. 3. Jamie Dimon knows who the biggest proponent of remote work is. When it comes to RTO, the JPMorgan Chase CEO said it's often the "people in the middle who complain a lot about it." That is, white-collar workers who generally have more freedom when it comes to where they work than frontline workers. Dimon, a longtime advocate for RTO, recently spoke at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he discussed his own bank's plans to go in-person.

Title: Stock market sell-off: Is a US recession ahead?

When Donald Trump was reelected in November, many investors declared the so-called Trump Trade would spur US stocks to new highs. But markets are now spooked by fears the world's largest economy is close to recession. Many investors believed Donald Trump's return to the White House as the United States' president would be a bonanza for the US stock market, which had already hit all-time highs in recent months thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. They argued that the dealmaking, "America First" president would be sensitive to any uncertainty in financial markets caused by his tariff policy and would likely intervene, if necessary, to help stabilize prices. But after weeks of uncertainty about Trump's protectionist measures, on Monday US stocks fell sharply, against the backdrop of fears that the world's largest economy could tip into recession later this year. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, while the Nasdaq toppled 4% — its steepest fall in two-and-a-half years. Tesla plummeted by 15%, while the Magnificent 7 stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla — collectively entered bear market territory. Deutsche Bank noted how these stocks have shed more than 20% of their value since December. Bloomberg reported that the combined wealth of the five billionaires who attended Trump's inauguration has been slashed by $209 billion (€191 billion) since January 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk alone has lost $144 billion. Markets appeared to be reacting to comments made by the president over the weekend, playing down the impact of his on-off tariff threats to Canada, Mexico and other major trading partners. The Republican also appeared dismissive about the impact his negotiating strategy was having on stocks. "There could be a little disruption [to financial markets]," Trump told Fox News on Sunday. "What I have to do is build a strong country. You can’t really watch the stock market." "President Trump seems to have abandoned the US stock market and is willing to put his political vision above the near-term outlook for the US economy," Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, wrote in a research note Monday, following the market rout. Citi, meanwhile, downgraded US stocks to "neutral" from "overweight" after the market closed, warning that the investment bank now thinks US growth momentum will "undershoot" the rest of the world. British banking giant HSBC also cut US equities to neutral for the next three to six months, saying the lender sees "better opportunities elsewhere for now." US policymakers have spent the past year trying to avoid plunging the economy into recession. Interest rates have fallen from their recent peak of 5.33%, which helped reduce inflation from its recent multi-decade highs. But Trump's various tariff policies threaten to disrupt efforts to achieve a soft landing. New 25% levies on all steel and aluminum imports into the US are due to take effect Wednesday, while new tariffs on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that: "The prospect of a recession in the US is lurking, with consumer confidence falling, companies facing increasing trade complexity and investors turning more nervous." In addition, the vast public sector cuts led by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk also threaten to weaken growth, as they will take jobs and investment out of the economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week a period of "natural adjustment" as the US moved from higher spending by the public to the private sector. "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We’ve become addicted to this government spending, and there’s going to be a detox period," Bessent told CNBC Friday, adding that a "one-time price adjustment" was to be expected from Trump's tariff policy. Also looming over the US economy is the threat of a partial shutdown of the federal government, if new funding can't be finalized before a Friday deadline. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives is due to vote Tuesday on legislation that would keep the government fully financed. The last government shutdown stretched over 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first term. Goldman Sachs cut its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy to just 1.7%, down from 2.4%. The US investment bank also raised its inflation forecast to 3% from a prior call in the mid-2% range. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Goldman analyst Jan Hatzius wrote. In the meantime, the Trump administration insists that a new round of tax cuts and revenues from tariffs on imports will help boost the economy. White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

Title: AI’s Future: Not Always Bigger

DeepSeekâs Real Impact On May 8, OâReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know Itâa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If youâre in the trenches building tomorrowâs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, weâd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI’s o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasnât so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good modelâalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists havenât taken seriously the abilities of Chinaâs technology sectorâbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. Thatâs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAIâs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inferenceâusing the modelâis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA’s valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeekâs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAIâs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibabaâs QwQ). While the meaning of âopenâ for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be âopen,â but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1âs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that DeepSeekâs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek âstealâ training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI wonât sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at âtheft,â but he also knows that law and PR arenât the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAIâs terms of service state, âAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.â Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? Thatâs the question we really need to answer. Metaâs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now âout of the (proprietary) box,â permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isnât the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. Weâre already seeing new models that were built on R1âand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeekâs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. Itâs based on Alibabaâs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human workâand none of these estimates include the cost of human laborâbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. Thatâs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers arenât beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and youâll probably need 64 GB of RAMâbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller âdistilledâ models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. Weâre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. Iâve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic âblitzscalingâ: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, itâs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, âThatâs nothing.â) Weâve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little thatâs concrete about OpenAIâs finances, everything weâve seen suggests that theyâre far from profitable2âa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAIâs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the USâs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I donât want to rush to the conclusion that it isnât necessary or advisable. But thatâs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. Thatâs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. Itâs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaireâs toy for achieving science fictionâs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work thatâs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of theseâand other cloud providersâare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we donât know how to answer yetâand probably wonât until weâre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although itâs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollarsâand possibly much lessâthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure thatâs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure thatâs needed will allow us to build a future thatâs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruptionâno doubt disruption thatâs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but thatâs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that weâll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencionâs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of âgarage AIâ startups, startups that arenât dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and âengagementââa process that, weâve seen, inevitably results in enshittificationâwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AIâs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining âalready hereâ¦just not unevenly distributed yet.â The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does ârelentlessly pro-humanâ mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of âgeneral intelligence.â Iâve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence isâthey’ve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isnât a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isnât a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedolâupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesnât fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machinesâat least in 2025âis that humans can want to do something. Machines canât. AlphaGo doesnât want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesnât want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; thatâs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, âI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.â You may not want to be there, but thatâs where creation startsâand creation is the reward. Thatâs why Iâm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, âItâs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people donât enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.â Donât get me wrongâSunoâs product is impressive, and Iâm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people donât enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didnât want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldnât have to say, âDonât quit the day job,â or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poetsâany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a âmoatâ that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. Weâre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for ârelentlessly pro-humanâ AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesnât matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what ârelentlessly humanâ might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isnât the lines of code that they produce; itâs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We wonât have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they wonât want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solveâthatâs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, weâre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is âslouching towards Bethlehemâ? We donât know, but there are some conclusions that we canât avoid: While there are many challenges to overcomeâlatency being the greatest of themâsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get ârelentlessly humanâ applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? Weâre about to find out.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses “with great difficulty,” making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business’ Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, “With great difficulty,” before taking a long pause and sighing. “But there’s no turning back, you’re saying?” Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is “just here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we’re making good progress.” Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would “be fine long-term,” experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City’s comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, “We don’t have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.” Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as “tech support.” The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk’s time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.

Title: AI reveals which reading method is best

Skip to comments. Posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice Here's the starting point for this article. For almost 100 years the Education Establishment has maneuvered, plotted, and schemed to eliminate phonics, and to make American children memorize sight-words. The pitch has always been sweeping: phonics can’t possibly work for a complex language like English, and sight-words are the only way to go. Teachers, students, and parents have been bullied relentlessly to embrace what phonics experts (such as Rudolf Flesch) assume is a fraud and a nonstarter. How does the ordinary citizen deal with this? Well, it's been rough because the professors at Harvard, etc. do not play games. They're trying, in my opinion, to dumb down the country in order to conquer it. They're not going to let you get in the way. In short, we have a perfect situation for testing what AI can do for us. A lot of people have the feeling that AI is like a Magic 8 Ball or Ouija board. Some profound truth is brought to us from the Great Beyond. Sorry, that's a false impression. AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard. You will be the judge and jury. Please send this on to parents you know with young children. It's the kids we are trying to save. ——-------------------------------------------------------- (Bruce Deitrick Price’s new novel is a smart, emotional thriller titled “The Boy Who Saves the World.” Visit Lit4u.com) TOPICS: Books/Literature; Computers/Internet; Education; Science KEYWORDS: ai; musk; phonics; robots; scifi Navigation: use the links below to view more comments. first 1-20, 21-33 next last 1 posted on 03/10/2025 4:13:40 PM PDT by BruceDeitrickPrice [ Post Reply | Private Reply | View Replies] To: BruceDeitrickPrice Phonics works for old English and for middle English too.

[ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Right. Phonics is essential but it works best on words with fairly simple spellings. It doesn’t help, for example, with the multiple ways to pronounce “ough”. Those kinds of words have to be memorized so they are recognized by sight. (Or is it “site”, or is it “cite”?). Of course, when a person has true fluency of reading, it’s all by sight. 6 posted on 03/10/2025 5:10:26 PM PDT by Southside_Chicago_Republican (God save the United States!) [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 4 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Agreed. My brother explained the phonics principle to me. But most of my reading was based on whole word recognition. For years, I had a vocabulary of words the pronunciation of which was somewhat vague to me. So it’s not either phonics or whole word, it can be both. And individuals will find different strategies best for them. 7 posted on 03/10/2025 5:35:43 PM PDT by maro (MAGA!)

As as consequence, I went years without misspelling words in English. It was helpful later in Spanish, German, Welsh, Italian and Turkish. I've had a little more difficultly with Irish and Scot's Gaelic since I don't have all the "rules" committed to memory for phonics in those two languages. There are nuances in French to blend trailing consonants and leading vowels. Another body of knowledge to learn.Japanese using hiragana and katakana is phonetic. Once you venture into Kanji, it becomes rote "sight words" to map the Kanji to words and meanings. Mandarin Chinese seems to be an exercise in sight words too, but a worthwhile exercise since written Chinese is standard while spoken Chinese is not e.g. Mandarin and Cantonese speakers can read and understand, but speak different words. 14 posted on 03/10/2025 10:00:23 PM PDT by Myrddin [ Post Reply | Private Reply | To 1 | View Replies] To: sjmjax Phonographix is a great method that encompasses the exceptions and decoding them.

My husband and I are homeschooling one of our grandchildren. He started with us the month he turned 12. He was completely illiterate and innumerate. He did not know the alphabet and couldn’t add 3+8. I started him on phonics. Three years and one month later, he is half-way through Saxon Math Algebra 1 and is fluently reading an Advanced Placement history book.

AI scans the vast amount of information found on the Internet (databases, libraries, archives of any kind) and summarizes. In the case of reading methods, you have to realize that the Education Establishment has been flooding the education zone with claims that we need sight-words and more sight-words. It wouldn't surprise me if the bias is 90% for sight-words and 10% for phonics. (Please note that our Education Establishment has been hugely inventive, renaming and reinventing sight-words every five or ten years. For example, we had Dolch words, Whole Word, Whole Language, Balanced Literacy, and many others.) When a community starts objecting too strenuously, the professors withdraw one phony theory and introduce another. During the 1920s, the Education Establishment maneuvered and probed: would it be possible to tell Americans to stop using what works, and do what doesn't work? In the Autumn of 1931, the Education Establishment went all-in on sight-words. Why then? The great stock market crash of 1929 and the resulting Depression convinced leftists that Marx was right. Capitalism was finished and Communism would prevail. The time to strike is now!But the first call for war occurred even earlier, in 1919, when Stalin and Lenin created the Communist International. These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war. This recap was necessary because now you see how easily the anti-phonics campaign could seem stronger. In fact, the arguments are sometimes presented as almost offsetting. Or phonics is better. If you want your children to learn to read, please deal with this verdict. One AI said: "Reading often depends on the individual…” But "phonics is fantastic because it teaches you how to decode words by understanding the sounds that letters and combination of letters make. It's like giving someone a toolbox to break down unfamiliar words and manageable pieces. Research shows that systematic phonics instructions helps most beginners build a strong foundation, especially for spelling and tackling new words, a huge validation of phonics.”Another said: “Studies, like the 2005 National Reading Panel, report that phonics boosts decoding skills, especially for beginners and struggling readers. It’s foundational because English is alphabetic—knowing sound-letter patterns lets kids tackle new words independently.” Still another said: “Evidence leans toward phonics as the stronger base—decoding is a transferable skill, while sight words are finite. The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week! Or at best, 100 words for the year!! Even if a few kids have a perfect memory, they never reach a few thousand words. But college students need 100,000 words, even 200,000 words. The whole dispute is ridiculous. Here's the beauty, and the point of this article. Everybody has access to AI now.You can phrase the question different ways. You can ask different AI's and see what they say. You can look at all the evidence, neatly summarized. We can take this whole discussion away from the pretenders at Harvard.

These people just finished defeating what was left of imperial Russia. They were ready to take on the United States, a smaller country. By 1921 the Communists (a.k.a. the Comintern) were infiltrating people into the media, education, foundations, cultural organizations, and so on. Where possible, the Communists jumped into local political campaigns at the state and local level. Thus began a 100-year civil war.

The 2000s Reading Wars settled this somewhat meta-analyses (e.g., Ehri et al., 2001) found phonics-first approaches outperform whole-word methods long-term, especially for spelling and word attack skills.” A personal note: after I've been studying this debate for many years, I often reminded myself that the whole word lunatics are trying to teach children about five words a week!

Title: Roundup: U.S. stocks slump as recession risks weigh on investors

Tuesday, 11 Mar 2025 by Benny Xie NEW YORK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks plunged on Monday as investors grappled with mounting concerns over the health of U.S. economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 890.01 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.71. The S&P 500 dropped 155.63 points, or 2.69 percent, closing at 5,614.56, while the Nasdaq Composite Index tumbled 727.90 points, or 4.00 percent, to 17,468.33, its worst day since 2022. Nine of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors ended in the red, with technology and consumer discretionary suffering the steepest declines, falling 4.34 percent and 3.90 percent respectively. In contrast, utilities and energy managed to post modest gains of 1.04 percent and 0.95 percent. Investor unease was fueled by the recent comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who acknowledged the possibility of a rough economic patch ahead. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Friday that the economy might experience a "detox period" as the new administration implements government spending cuts. During a Fox News interview aired on Sunday, Trump described the economic situation as a "period of transition" when asked about the potential for a recession. "What I have to do is build a strong country," Trump said. "You can't really watch the stock market." These remarks, coupled with escalating trade tensions -- highlighted by ongoing tariff negotiations between the United States, Mexico, and Canada -- have rattled market participants. The technology-heavy Nasdaq recorded its worst day since 2022, as major players like Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta each fell over 4 percent, with Tesla plunging 15.43 percent. Amid these developments, the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since December, reflecting a widespread move away from risk. "This is the first time we've had an administration pretty much say with a straight face... the objectives are going to cause pain," said Shelby McFaddin, investment analyst at Motley Fool Asset Management. The S&P 500 has now erased all the gains it made since Election Day in early November last year. The Nasdaq has been hit even harder, as a rally in big tech stocks driven by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence reversed course. "There's just no support in the tech stocks right now," said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist at Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. Analysts are increasingly worried that the U.S. economy may face a prolonged period of sluggish growth. In a research note, Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius revised his 2025 GDP forecast downward to 1.7 percent from 2.4 percent while raising his projection for the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to end the year at 3 percent -- up from prior estimates in the mid-2 percent range. These updated forecasts mark the first time in roughly two and a half years that U.S. GDP growth is expected to fall below consensus data, which currently anticipates above 2 percent growth. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Hatzius wrote. "Our near-term view is that the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) will want to stay on the sidelines and make as little news as possible until the policy outlook has become clearer," he added. Investors continued to seek safe-haven assets, driving demand for bonds and pushing the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield down to 4.22 percent, as bond prices and yields move inversely. The simultaneous decline in stocks and interest rates is often viewed as a sign of growing economic uncertainty. Adding to the cautious sentiment, oil prices also dropped, reflecting broader concerns about the economy's outlook. Morgan Stanley's Michael Wilson cautioned that U.S. stocks could decline another 5 percent as worries mount over the impact of tariffs on corporate earnings and the effects of reduced fiscal spending. The strategist warned the benchmark could sink 20 percent in the likelihood of a recession. "We are not there, but things can change quickly and so it's useful to know the downside in the bear case to manage one's risk," Wilson said. As market sentiment is fragile, investors continue to weigh Trump's mixed signals on tariffs and recession warnings against the backdrop of tightening trade policies and evolving monetary policy expectations. The coming weeks will be critical, with the February consumer price index scheduled for release on Wednesday and the producer price index set to follow on Thursday. Thank you for your report!

Title: The Bubble is Bursting
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/the-bubble-is-bursting/
Time Published: 2025-03-10T22:01:37Z
Full Content:
By Adam Sharp PostedMarch 10, 2025 In 2000, Sun Microsystems was one of the hottest stocks in the world. Sun seemed to have everything going for it. They were a leader in computer hardware, and offered cutting-edge software solutions. They were an integral part of the fast-growing internet ecosystem. Shares soared from $5 to $64 at the peak in 2000. The company’s market cap reached $200 billion, and the price/sales ratio reached 10x (price/sales is the ratio between a company’s market cap and its revenue – higher means more expensive). By 2002, Sun Microsystems shares had crashed 90%. That year CEO Scott McNealy penned a famous letter titled “Dear Mr. Shareholder”. In it, McNealy chastised investors for running Sun’s stock price up to such ridiculous levels. Specifically, he singled out the 10x price/sales number, and explained exactly what such a valuation implies: At 10 times revenues, to give you a 10-year payback, I have to pay you 100% of revenues for 10 straight years in dividends. That assumes I have zero cost of goods sold, which is very hard for a computer company. That assumes zero expenses, which is really hard with 39,000 employees. That assumes I pay no taxes which is very hard. And that assumes you pay no taxes on your dividends which is kind of illegal. And that assumes with zero R&D for the next 10 years, I can maintain the current revenue run rate. Now, having done that, would any of you like to buy my stock at $64? Do you realize how ridiculous those basic assumptions are? You don’t need any transparency. You don’t need any footnotes. What were you thinking? Eventually Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle for $9.40 per share. That’s down 85% from its 2000 high. As of the end of 2024, the S&P Information Technology index traded at a 9.9x price/sales ratio. Take a look at this chart: Source: Hussman Funds After the recent pullback, the index is probably trading at “only” 8x or 9x sales. The point remains the same. The market is wildly overvalued, especially tech. There are outliers like Palantir (PLTR), which trades at an eye-popping 69x price/sales ratio, even after its recent fall. That’s almost 7x higher than Sun Microsystems at its 2000 peak. Palantir is a solid company, but it’s one of the most overpriced stocks I’ve ever seen. In late January, Jim Rickards penned an article for us titled “A U.S. Recession is Coming”. In it, he laid out the case quite clearly. Markets are at or near all-time highs based on every available metric: P/E ratios, the CAPE ratio, market cap/GDP ratio, concentration risk, etc. This stock market bubble is amplified by indexing, investor complacency and analyst euphoria. When such conditions have existed in the past, they have always been followed by market crashes of 50% to 90% unfolding over several years. Examples include the Dow Jones Industrial Average (1929), the Nikkei (1989), NASDAQ (2000), and the S&P 500 Index (2008). We are now positioned for an historic crash. The specific cause does not matter – it could be war, natural disaster, a bank or hedge fund collapse or other unexpected event. What matters is the super-fragility of the market when the trigger is pulled. This is why Warren Buffett has over $300 billion in cash and why central banks are buying gold. And now the bubble falters. As I write this at 11:00 am on Monday March 10th, the Nasdaq is down 3.6% on the day. If the bubble is popping, it’s still early in that process. As Jim noted above, major crashes involve 50-90% downturns. Right now the Nasdaq is only down about 14%. It could have a lot farther to fall. The hottest stocks typically fall the hardest. Think NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla. They are all fundamentally sound companies, but they trade at crazy prices. Just like Sun Microsystems in 2000, today’s tech valuations are utterly unsustainable. Bubbles can be fantastic money-making opportunities. But it looks like this one is drawing to a close. So if you’re still sitting on major tech gains (or losses), it might still be a good idea to take some off the table. Sure, there’s a chance that the market turns around and soars to new highs. But at this point, that looks highly unlikely. As I explained in The Pain Begins, it appears that Trump has decided to accept short-term market pain for long-term economic gains. We can’t look to Trump to save the market. He’s fully focused on saving the real economy. The market looks to be headed significantly lower. This week we’ll review strategies to navigate this new era.

March 10, 2025 14:53 ET | Source: Robbins LLP Robbins LLP SAN DIEGO, March 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins LLP reminds stockholders that a class action was filed on behalf of all investors who purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. AppLovin Corporation engages in building a software-based platform for advertisers to enhance the marketing and monetization of their content in the United States and internationally. For more information, submit a form, email attorney Aaron Dumas, Jr., or give us a call at (800) 350-6003. The Allegations: Robbins LLP is Investigating Allegations that AppLovin (APP) Misled Investors Regarding its Profitability According to the complaint, during the class period, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The complaint alleges that while defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors, they were concealing material adverse facts related to AppLovin’s manipulative practices to force unwanted apps on customers using a “backdoor installation scheme,” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn its profitability. Plaintiff alleges that the truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. On this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. What Now: You may be eligible to participate in the class action against AppLovin Corporation. Shareholders who want to serve as lead plaintiff for the class must file their papers with the court by May 5, 2025. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. You do not have to participate in the case to be eligible for a recovery. If you choose to take no action, you can remain an absent class member. For more information, click here. All representation is on a contingency fee basis. Shareholders pay no fees or expenses.

CoinGlass data reveals that just over $535 million in long positions and $176 million in shorts have been wound up in the past day, with Bitcoin alone witnessing $304 million in liquidations. The total figure of $712 million represents an 85%% increase in the past 24 hours, with the dramatic uptick in liquidations resulting in a 4% decline in total open interest, to $87 billion. The cascade in liquidations means that Bitcoin is now down by 4% in the past 24 hours and by 11% in a week, with the cryptocurrency market as a whole suffering a 5.5% decline today. And for some analysts, the Bitcoin price descending to $80,000 today runs the risk of further liquidations in the coming days and potentially weeks. “Looking at the current liquidation heat maps, I think if the price were to drop to $80,000 or so on even weaker sentiment, this could trigger more liquidations of long positions, and in turn cause the price to fall further,” says eToro analyst Simon Peters, speaking to Decrypt. Peters also notes that, in the past, we have seen “retracements of 20-35%” in bull markets before a bottom is found and a recovery is set in mention. “$80,000 is a 28% drawdown or retracement from the $109,300 all-time high,” he explains. “If the price were to fall further due to the reasons mentioned above, a 35% drawdown from the all-time high would put the price at $70,000 before any base is potentially formed.” However, Peters also suggests that a recovery to the $84,000-$85,000 region could end up triggering a liquidation of shorts, thereby helping to accelerate a rebound. For some industry figures, one of the reasons why liquidations have been so severe today is that they’ve been driven by retail more than institutions. “Many of the recent liquidations likely stem from inexperienced traders who entered the market during the “extreme greed” phase in December 2024, driven by the so-called ‘Trump-pump,’” says Unity Wallet COO James Toledano, speaking to Decrypt. The declines that set off today’s liquidations likely followed from several fundamental reasons, including U.S. President Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a recession amid a growing trade war with other economies. Investors have also been spooked by analysis which shows that the North Korean Bybit hackers have been able to successfully cash out $300 million of their $1.5 billion haul, with the converted funds unlikely to ever be traced or recovered. “Expectations were simply too high, and the market is now paying the price,” says Toledano. “One of the biggest letdowns has been the U.S. Bitcoin Strategic Reserve, which turned out to be nothing more than a repackaging of seized FBI assets—around 200,000 BTC ($16.5 billion), just 1% of Bitcoin’s market cap ($1.65T as of today)—placed under the control of the Federal Reserve.” The poor sentiment is reflected in one particular prediction market on Myriad Markets, which shows that 100% of participants believe that the Fear and Greed Index will not rise to 25% or above today. (Disclosure: Myriad is a prediction market and engagement platform developed by Dastan, parent company of an editorially independent Decrypt.) Yet for some observers, the crypto market isn’t sensitive to macroeconomics so much as it’s correlated to US markets, in particular tech stocks. “The biggest factor pushing prices down isn't the Bybit hack or the disappointing Strategic Bitcoin Reserve, it's the steep fall in the Nasdaq stock market index, particularly the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks—Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla,” says Glen Goodman, a cryptocurrency analyst and author of The Crypto Trader. Goodman tells Decrypt that Bitcoin's price has generally shown a “very strong correlation” with tech sticks, and that whenever tech struggles “investors flee” from crypto. This view is supported by the fact that, according to Toledano, “Bitcoin ETFs have seen outflows for a fourth consecutive week, totaling $4.5 billion,” a sign that many of the institutions which have probably been invested in tech stocks have also been selling their crypto holdings. Toledano suggests that if sentiment remains fragile, leveraged positions will continue to be at risk, although a flushing out of over-leveraged traders could help prepare the ground for a rebound. “The key indicators to watch are derivatives positioning, spot demand, and institutional flows,” he says. “If risk appetite recovers, BTC could stabilize or even rally, but if fear continues to dominate, further downside is likely.” Edited by Stacy Elliott.

Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff.

Notable reports expected this week include: These data points will be closely monitored, as they could influence the Federal Reserve’s next move on interest rates and shape investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve has been working to tame inflation after it peaked above 9% in 2022. Despite some progress, inflation remains stubbornly above the Fed’s 2% target. If Wednesday’s CPI data shows continued inflationary pressure, the Fed may consider maintaining higher interest rates for a longer period. A cooling labor market and slowing economic growth add complexity to the Fed’s decision-making. Policymakers must balance curbing inflation without triggering a deep recession. With Trump’s economic agenda—including tariffs, spending cuts, and stricter immigration policies—shaping future economic conditions, the Fed’s next steps will be closely scrutinized.

Title: Stock Market Comeback Erased: S&P 500 Sinks To 6-Month Low As Trump Says Don’t ‘Watch The Stock Market’

The stock market selloff stretched into a new week, with the latest losses heagain tied to comments from President Donald Trump, whose wide-sweeping and oft-changing tariff policies have rattled Wall Street confidence, as early fears of a recession emerge. Traders work the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week. All three major U.S. stock indexes fell significantly Monday, erasing Friday afternoon’s comeback. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 2.1%, or 890 points, while the S&P 500 declined 2.7% and the Nasdaq Composite sank 4%. The benchmark S&P and the Nasdaq closed at their lowest respective levels since mid September, while the Dow ended at its lowest price since September. Monday was be the Nasdaq’s worst daily decline since September 2022. Driving Monday’s pullback was Trump’s interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” released Sunday, during which Trump declined to rule out a recession, warned of a period of economic “transition” and cautioned “you can’t really watch the stock market.” Trump’s comments are “weighing on sentiment” and “did nothing to ease investor concerns about ongoing policy chaos,” Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye wrote in a Monday note to clients. Trump may say to heed little attention to near-term stock moves, but the losses are staggering. The Nasdaq is in correction territory, declining 13% from its closing price on Feb. 19, when the market took a sharply negative turn. The S&P is down 9% during that period, while the Dow is down 6%, or 2,700 points. The S&P is fresh off of its worst week since September, declining 3.1% last week. Big Tech stocks are the most notable individual losers during the brutal three-week stretch, namely artificial intelligence chip architect Nvidia and electric vehicle maker Tesla, led by Trump administration official Elon Musk. Shares of Nvidia dipped 5% on Monday, extended its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 23%, and shares of Tesla fell 14%, pushing its loss dating back to Feb. 19 to 37%. Also sinking Monday were shares of Apple, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta, as each Silicon Valley giant sank about 5% as investors fled to safety. 20%. That’s about how much the “magnificent seven” group of big American tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — is collectively down from its December record, according to Bloomberg. The recent decline coincided with Trump’s implementation of tariffs, which are largely a bad thing for stocks as they can hurt corporate profit margins and soften consumer demand. But even beyond any negative direct effects of tariffs, markets have responded negatively to Trump’s frequent waffling on when the duties will go into effect, as well as what goods. “The reason stocks are dropping is the spike in uncertainty and fear that uncertainty will lead to a whole host of negatives,” explained Essaye. To that end, the new fear of the U.S. entering a recession has become a topic of conversation. Goldman Sachs economists increased their recession forecast Friday, calling for 20% odds of a significant downturn over the next 12 months, up from 15%, citing trade policies. Morgan Stanley strategists led by Michael Wilson maintained their 6,500 price target for the S&P by the end of 2025, calling for a 16% gain from Monday’s roughly 5,610. Trump’s policies will be “sequenced in a more growth-negative way to start the year before” lower interest rates and friendlier corporate policies “benefit the market later in the year,” said Wilson. “This is a headline driven market, one that could change in an hour. Sit tight. Buckle up,” Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group, wrote in emailed comments. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: What is Alphabet Inc.?
URL: https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Alphabet-Inc
Time Published: 2025-03-10T16:07:00Z
Full Content:
Alphabet Incorporated (also known as Alphabet Inc. or simply Alphabet) is a conglomerate of numerous companies, including the search engine giant Google. In 2015, Alphabet became Google's holding company. As of 2025, Google, along with many other companies like Fitbit, Waymo and Mandiant, remains a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet. Google Inc. co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page created Alphabet Inc. on Oct. 2, 2015. They announced their intentions to create a new holding company in August 2015. Alphabet was the result of its wish to strategically restructure the original company to make it cleaner, leaner, and more accountable to its investors and customers. With this change, Alphabet replaced Google Inc. as a publicly traded entity. Alphabet also became the parent company for many other businesses that originally fell under the Google Inc. umbrella and for other companies acquired after the 2015 split. The company is incorporated in Delaware; its headquarters are at Googleplex in Mountain View, Calif. According to Larry Page's open letter on the Alphabet Investor Relations page, it says he and Brin chose the name "Alphabet" because the word means "a collection of letters that represent language, one of humanity's most important innovations, and is the core of how we index with Google search." Page also said they favored the name because it breaks down into alpha-bet. In a financial context, alpha means investment return above benchmark, which is what the company has always strived for, according to Page. As part of the transition from Google Inc. to Alphabet, all Google shares were transferred to Alphabet stock on a share-for-share basis, with the former automatically converting into the same number of shares of the latter, with all the same rights. Alphabet trades on the Nasdaq composite under Google's former ticker symbols, GOOG and GOOGL. These symbols represent two types of shares. GOOGL shares are Class A shares or common stock. These shares confer ownership stake and voting rights on stockholders. GOOG shares are Class C shares that confer no voting rights on holders. By issuing Class C shares, Brin and Page were able to preserve their control while also positioning the firm to take advantage of liquidity in the public market. During a five-year period between December 2018 and December 2023, Alphabet's net income increased by 23% and its revenue by 18.%. Its gross margin also increased by 61%, and cash flow rose 25%. Between March 2024 and January 2025, the share price fluctuated between $131 and $206. Toward the end of January 2025, GOOG shares were trading on Nasdaq composite at over $200. Alphabet offers a broad range of digital products and services. Its most famous product is the Google search engine, which was launched in 1999 and occupies the largest market share as of January 2025. Some other popular products from Alphabet under the Google umbrella include the following: Besides these consumer products, Google's product suite also includes products for business use: Other well-known Google products include Google Cloud, a cloud computing platform that allows users to access numerous services over the cloud, and the Google Workspace suite of cloud-based productivity apps. In recent years, Google has scaled up efforts to develop its AI capabilities and product suite. This has yielded products such as the following: Alphabet's offerings also span products and services such as the following: These products are independently developed and marketed by Alphabet's many other (non-Google) subsidiaries. Between 2015 and 2025, Alphabet acquired more than 150 companies, many of which occurred after the first few years of its inception. Notable acquisitions for Alphabet include the following: The wide range of acquisitions highlights Alphabet's willingness to look beyond its Google search roots and, as Page said in his investor letter of 2015, to contain "the companies that are pretty far afield of our main internet products" within Alphabet. Despite Alphabet's expansion, Google remains one of its largest subsidiaries. In addition to the original search engine and digital advertising businesses, Google maintains control over many of its other profitable legacy businesses for Alphabet, including YouTube, Android OS, Google Maps, Gmail and Google Cloud. Other offshoots of the former company including GV (formerly Google Ventures); CapitalG (formerly Google Capital); X, The Moonshot Factory (formerly Google X); and Google Nest (formerly Nest Labs) are also Alphabet subsidiaries. These companies are considered part of the "Other Bets" segment of Alphabet. They bring in relatively little revenue but allow Alphabet to expand its presence into more domains where it can continue developing innovative products and services. Each subsidiary has its own CEO in keeping with the founders' aim to have a strong CEO to run and lead each business toward its future. Also, because Google still brings in a bulk of Alphabet's revenue, it allows the other subsidiaries more room for experimentation and risk-taking. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google and Alphabet. Alphabet is one of the world's biggest companies in revenue and profits. It is also one of only about 10 companies with over $1 trillion market capitalization. Other notable companies in this elite club include the following: Some of these companies are also considered competitors of Alphabet because they operate in similar areas or offer similar products. For example, Microsoft offers a cloud computing platform called Azure that's similar to Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform, and a search engine called Bing that's similar to Google search. In the cloud space, particularly in the CRM market, Google competes with Salesforce. Similarly, the Google Pixel smartphone competes with Apple's iPhone while Google and Meta compete in the areas of digital advertising and communications. Other notable competitors of Alphabet (and Google) are as follows: At the time of Alphabet's founding, Brin was its president and Page its CEO. They both resigned from their respective positions in December 2019. Google's former product chief, Sundar Pichai, then stepped in as CEO. He had already been appointed CEO of Google in 2015. Even before he was appointed Google CEO, Pichai had taken on product and engineering responsibility for the company's internet businesses. During his tenure, he oversaw the development of numerous new initiatives and product launches, including Google's mobile OS Android, the Pixel smartphone, Google Meet video conferencing platform and Google Workspace (formerly G-suite) suite of cloud-based productivity apps. Some of the other key people at Alphabet include the following: Like many other large technology behemoths, Alphabet has found itself at the center of numerous legal troubles since its inception. Many of these troubles concern the company's anticompetitive business practices and antitrust violations. In August 2024, a U.S. District Court ruled that Google's search engine operates as a monopoly in the USA and unfairly blocks competitors from expanding their search engine market share. This practice was deemed a violation of the USA's Sherman Antitrust Act (Section 2), which prohibits businesses from restraining interstate commerce using conspiracies or unfair contracts. Google has said it will appeal this decision; no determination has been made as of February 2025, on what penalties Google will incur. Google has a long history of antitrust violations and subsequent punishments that predate the 2024 lawsuit. For example, the EU imposed a fine of €4.3 billion ($4.5 billion) on Google for creating an unfair monopoly in the mobile OS space with Android. The company also has faced numerous antitrust and class action lawsuits in 2020, 2023 and other years, all of which accused it of engaging in anticompetitive conduct that enhanced its power at the cost of its competitors.

Do you wanna do full range? -Just the elbow motion. -Do you wanna squeeze at the top? -Amplitude… -Eh, you know… If we could do this, like, outside my apartment 5 minutes away at a cafe – sure! Do I swing my sword around like this? Or do I do like… -What are the first 3 supplements that you would recommend the average intermediate trainee to look at. Or formulated otherwise, what are the 3 supplements that you recommend the most often? -Man, that’s tough because I’m now sponsored by a new company that has “the ultimate 6 supplements”. They explicitly told me never ever mention 1 without mentioning the other 5. So I’m actually contractually obligated not to answer this question. Is there another question I can answer? -Right. Go with creatine then. -So this is just creatine 123. Yeah. So I think it depends on how we talk about supplements, because I typically don’t talk about multivitamins as a supplement, even though it is. It’s not something they considered like for health and fitness. And I think it’s like way more for health than it is for fitness. It’s not going to get you more jacked. But I think that if you’re serious enough to be taking supplements, I think that you should consider multivitamin, multimineral in any of the many, many ways that you can take such a thing, including some of the better kind of greens, powders type situations. I think sometimes they have some merit to more or less just round out your intake of micronutrients to make sure that, like, you’re not just missing like entire swathes of, you know, the D vitamins or something, which can make a difference. And so I would say like some, you know, counter consideration can be made for multivitamin multimineral. Though the, the literature on that is not super clear. And there are lots of caveats and contextual things. Creatine is hugely in consideration at the top three. It’s probably one of the most empirically well-supported supplements. It’s empirically supported and also supported in a few different ways that are worth mentioning. One way it’s supported is, it’s just direct scientific investigations show that it almost always works to gain muscle and strength. It’s also, very, very importantly, well understood in the, in the trenches, so to speak, in the fitness world, to be like something that actually works. You know, there’s a few things that have a good empirical support, but the effect magnitude is so small that nobody really uses it. And people who tried it, they’re like, I don’t know if it does anything. Creatine does stuff, which is sweet. It’s also the physiological rationale, the chemical rationale makes perfect sense. And, all those aligning is a pretty damn good. And also creatine is like a few interesting potential cognitive benefits and health benefits, which is at some point creating kind of seems like essential almost to take if you want to optimize and so creatine is good. And, you know, slot number 3 would be kind of a mix and match of what sorts of challenges are you running into in your life? If you are in a situation where you find the literature on intro workout, post-workout nutrition compelling, and worth your time, and then you have everything else sorted in your nutrition, I would say getting a high quality whey or whey like protein with a rapidly digesting carbohydrate, like Powerade or Gatorade powder or something, consuming that during and after your workout might be something that makes it things go better, especially if you’re workouts are very hard or very long. And if you can throw some electrolytes in there, then, if your workouts have you sweating a lot and stuff, then that can really quite, make a decent impact. Very marginal effect in total, but it’s one of those things, like… it makes such good theoretical sense and experientially so many people who have tried it they’re like: “The last half an hour of my workout just goes way better if I do this.” then great. It also sets you up for if you finish your whey protein, your carbs after training, you have time to shower, you have time to drive without needing to be paranoid about instantly, you know, guzzling down as much protein as possible. So that can be quite nice and convenient. It’s also very, has a very good price performance. A lot of people will illusorily say, I’m sure you get this all the time, like, I can’t afford supplements. Like you understand, whey protein is cheaper than meat in almost every context. So… and higher quality. So… it’s just very, very difficult to say it’s bad. But if you’re a person who struggles to get daily protein in, up to high enough levels, then I would say yes, whey protein is a consideration for supplementation, but also so is casein protein. And so it’s like egg protein. And a variety of vegan proteins can do a great job like soy protein if you are a vegan. And so just any kind of protein supplement to get you up to your daily standard of multiple meals throughout the day, roughly even protein, I think, is a really excellent thing. Is it technically a supplement? Oh, yeah, we can argue all day. It’s really kind of just a food. But I think so. Basically. If you’re not taking some kind of multivitamin-multimineral, if your diet is a very well rounded, you don’t have to and then you’re totally good. If you’re not taking creatine and if you’re not taking some kind of protein on an as needed basis, then, I would say though, those are probably the first supplements to look at. A couple of… can I talk about some ones that didn’t make the list? -Sure. Yeah. -Yeah, like… So, you know, if you need energy and focus and stuff, I think caffeine based stimulant product pre-workout can have an utility function that’s positive for you. Not everyone needs that sort of thing. I don’t. A lot of people think, like, you know, they train at 6 p.m., and so, like, it’s just intractable because they would just never fall asleep or the sleep quality sucks, but a lot of people like that sort of thing. And there are, you know, a few other supplements that have kind of sort of contextual situation. Sometimes literature on omega 3 looks pretty good, sometimes it doesn’t look so good. Generally it’s fine, so maybe that’s something to consider, a healthy fat supplement. But, you know, I think those are probably in the conversation for me for things to consider. And the last thing I’ll say is, you know, outside of creatine just probably being better to take than not to take and making sure that, you know, your vitamin mineral levels are good. And if not, feel free to supplement. There are ways to just never have to eat supplements and get all the protein you need. And after that all of the supplements that you could take that really make a difference, at least today, don’t have a lot of convincing evidence that you even need to take them. And so it’s kind of, a thing where I think a lot of people get to the intermediate stage and think, okay, like time for supplements. And they open the door metaphorically to supplements, and that room is like, like one dustbin falls over and a spider crawls across the floor… The fuck? It’s nothing in here, really. Creatine is in there by itself. Like “I thought you’d never come rescue me.” And so, you know, like, it’s just, supplements just aren’t that big of a deal to begin with. So I just want to make sure people get that information. Because I think a lot of people, you tell them, like “When you’re in intermediate, man, get creatine, and protein will jack you up…” and then… is just not true that these make such a huge effect that you even need to be taking them. -Yeah, it’s one of the things where people micromanage the most about the things that actually matter the least… probably. And I would agree that most of the supplements that I recommend to clients or people, there are things that you could get from your diet, but people don’t, whether that’s magnesium or vitamin D, vitamin D you can also get from the sun not so much diet in the first place. And then there’s creatine, basically… Do you put any stock in anything beyond creatine or that you wouldn’t get from your diet like citrulline, beta-alanine? -So beta-alanine is a fun supplement. I don’t like how it makes my skin feel. It’s not. A lot of people think that feels nice. I hate it. -The tingling… -Yes. Is it just not convincing to me that it causes muscle growth and since muscle growth is kind of the only thing I optimize on, if I was interested in sport performance maximally, I would probably have phases of beta-alanine administration because it is quite a decent buffer and it can let you get a few more reps or a few more steps or a few more rolls. -Not for jiu jitsu? -So, I don’t optimize for jiu jitsu. If I was, I’d may very well take it. And, so that’s a fun supplement, Citrulline malate, it does some things, but, it just hasn’t stood the test of time in a way that we can say, like, this is for sure the things it does, and they’re really good and they’re really meaningful. I wanted, you know, in the 2010 citrulline was something that everyone was looking at very closely at, and it just kind of was like, you know, like it’s like your friend goes on a couple dates with a guy and she’s like “I think he’s great.” And a couple weeks later, like, “How’s Frank?” She’s like “.%##&% Frank…”, you know… And you’re like: “Oh shit, you know, it’s just some guy.” So citrulline, it just doesn’t seem to have that kind of real raw, like, wow effect magnitude that makes it malleable for me. -Yeah. What you very often seen with supplements and especially with citrulline is that people get very excited about a proxy for the results that they’re looking for. So citrulline makes you do more reps and then they’re like, more gains. But actually there’s no study finding statistically significantly greater muscle growth with citrulline supplementation than without it. Now, the supplements… the research is a little bit limited, but with supplements I think the bar can be pretty high because there’s so much stuff that goes on. So many publication bias, false positives… So if there’s not very compelling research showing it actually does improve the outcome that you’re looking for, like muscle growth, I think it’s indeed very fair to say you can have a very skeptical outlook towards that something. -Yeah. And it doesn’t mean a cynical outlook because you can say… look like, five studies later, we might all be taking citrulline malate. Five very good studies, replicated by different labs… But for now, there’s no doubt, I think like, from a kind of grander perspective on truth value, there are probably at least a few supplements currently in use and sold somewhere in small health food stores that are actually bangers, like they fuck and they work. We just don’t have the research volume to say for sure. And because humans have limited money, and the number of supplements you can buy is actually so… kind of unlimited. Like there are hundreds of them. And they each cost $20-$60 per month. Man. You know, you just don’t want to take them all. If you’re Brian Johnson, then you’re, you know, trillionaire or whatever, you can take all of them. But he’s really systematic, too, about taking a lot of supplements for a long time, trying to figure out which ones work, which ones don’t. And then he, like, puts a bunch of them away after another. Yep. That didn’t work. That didn’t work. If you want to do something like that, that’s cool. The ROI on that for him is awesome, for you and me and everyone else is going to be a gigantic fucking waste of time. Better he does it and we find out what works by him. But yeah, no doubt there there are supplements because what I don’t want people to get the perception of. And I used to commit this fallacy all the time is the like “Keep it simple stupid” fallacy. You know, can you imagine, like, telling someone who works at a video who designed a GPU cores to keep it simple? He’s like, get out of my face. You have no idea how complicated this is. The human body is quite complex, and there are no doubt supplements out there that absolutely work, we just don’t know about in a real confirmatory way. And so in the future, we have to be open minded that some supplements really do work, because a lot of people get this idea when we speak that, oh, just like 2 or 3 things that work, everything else doesn’t work. It’s like, no, that doesn’t work. It’s some of them don’t work because we’ve studied like, you know, ten times and it just comes up zero every time – probably doesn’t work. But a lot of them were just like, I’m just… I’m just not sure if they work, you know. And so because they cost money, you know… A very terrible analogy I always give is like, would you drive three hours one way and three hours back to, like, hook up with a hook up buddy who, like, just does it every time, like, she’s got it like, yeah, maybe. Right? But if it was like, hey, would you drive three hours for someone that may or may not even show up to the date? You’re like, man, three hours, bro… You know, if you could do this, like outside my apartment five minutes away at a cafe, sure. But like three hours, no. That cost, you know, if someone was willing to ship you free supplements every month and try new supplements all the time, I’d say yes. Try them all. You know, not gonna kill you. But because they cost money and because you put your hopes and dreams into them working I would say for the most part, stick to the ones that probably work. -Speaking of things that actually work, what do you think… What do you think the things are that really move the needle the most for an intermediate level trainee? So they’re doing the basics. You know, they’re doing strength training. They are consuming enough protein. They’re tracking the macros. They have a at least some decent volume of training and decent effort. They got their newbie gains and then they get kind of stuck. What do you think are the things that, for those types of individuals, have the most effect, things they could do, like invest more time in to get better gains? -One is… …so the intermediates, right? They’re early intermediates or late intermediates? -Let’s say early intermediates. -So it’s a… try to analyze whether or not you are pushing yourself hard in the gym on an objective standard. -How do you know that? -So you set yourself a goal of getting roughly 3 RIR in the first week of your mesocycle, and you write down all your sets and reps, and then every single week after until you have to deload you make it your fucking mission as a grown adult to match or exceed every single… exceed every time. So if it’s the same weight, one more rep every set, if it’s, a little bit more weight, same reps. Don’t let your reps fall until you hit failure, and not failure like you gave up. Failure like somebody is there to make sure you don’t die and really learn what that feels like. You may just be training either exactly as hard as you thought and you’re like, okay, that’s not a limiting factor. Great. I can move on to the next thing, or you will be like, oh yeah, I can try harder because a lot of people will do independent RIR estimates, which are totally cool way to train. And that means like every time you come to the gym, whatever you’re RIR is, it doesn’t matter if it’s failure or if it’s 2 RIR, they’ll just sort of organically get to it and every time, independently of what happened last session, independently of the next session. And that’s cool. And if you have, a really hard training drive, it’s an excellent way to train. It’s also very liberating. You just fucking send it, you know, you don’t have to worry about numbers, or anything like that. But if you suspect you might not be training hard enough, which I find that a lot of folks who are intermediates can train harder, than the easiest way to do it, in my opinion, the most straightforward and more systematic is to set yourself a nice, easy goal in the first week and just keep beating it by a little. And at some point it’s going get really tough, and then you’re going to find out how tough is it, because some people will say, oh man, I got ten reps and I couldn’t have gotten 11. But if last week you got 11 and this week it’s just 2.5 more pounds on the bar, you need to get 11, then… …seeing it from that mentality, you might get 11. And then next week you get 11 again. And the week after you’re like, there’s no way I’m going to do it. But you believe in yourself and you get 11 again. Then you find out what really hard training is, and then you find out if it was limiting you or not. Because sometimes hard training like is roughly the same and sometimes hard training is a big, big unlock. So I’d say that’s something worth exploring. Once you’ve done that… So… -Progressive overload, very important. -Yes, yes. -Reps in reserve and testing that you’re actually getting to that desired level of proximity to failure by occasionally going to failure. -Yes. But not, not just going to failure. Trying to meet an objective standard you don’t know if you can meet, but really putting your ego behind it, because what you may think is your failure point is your failure point, but it’s much more psychological and physiological. But if you unlock your psychology to say, I don’t give a fuck what happens, I’m going to go all the way and let’s see if I can get 11 reps and maybe you’ll get 9, And you look like: I really did try absolutely as hard as I could, but whatever. If you think you’re really, really, really, really trying and you’re not making the gains you want, that’s probably not where you’re going to get more, more gains. But if you’ve never objectively put up a standard… Why am I saying this? Personal trainer for a long time, coaching people for a long time, coaching myself for a long time… You’d be really, really surprised in many cases when you put an objective standard to someone’s performance week after week how much their performance elevates, because usually, you know, especially when you’re highly fatigued after a few weeks, you need like, what do you call them? Reactive deload. Your biceps are kind of cooked. You’re like, I deload time. But really, like, you really were three RIR and you know, your girlfriend kind of was bitching at you that week, school kind of got hard, your psychology drained a little bit and you’re like…. And it’s like, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah. And I go, well, how many reps were you trying to get? And they’re like, well, I wasn’t trying to get the number of reps, I was just trying to go to failure. Like your mind can trick you, man. Your mind can fucking trick you and can say, oh, this is failure. Like, no, no, no, no, no. Like we don’t have a marathon race or 500 or a 100 meter or a 200 meter race that race isn’t just go really fast until you get tired. Like it’s… the line ends here. You’re expected to go as hard as you can until that line. And so with weights and reps, you just keep extending that line a little bit. Look what you can’t do it. Hey, you know you tried, but there’s always an objective standard you could raise yourself to. And sometimes your body will take you there. And for me personally, like this is really true, especially as you get stronger because like when you’re squatting 400 4 sets of 10 your warm up with 400 for a double. Feels like, dude, I can get 3 and then I fucking break in half. Like there’s no way I can do those. How the hell… And then if it was just a standalone workout, I mean, you might feel your swag a little bit. You might do 400 for a set of 5 next time, pretty hard. You’re gonna… pretty good. Might do a set of 8, then a back off, set of 6. But if you go and look at your notebook and you’re like, last week I did 390 for 3 by 10, I’m gonna do 400 for 3 by fucking 10. I’m going to goddamn try. And then ten, ten, ten and you did it. But like, it took a lot and somehow you got it out of your muscles. Now, you know, you’re training hard and you just don’t have to worry about it anymore if that’s limiting factor. Another thing I would say is an interesting potential unlock for folks of that experience level is to do specialization phases, because you might have gotten away with 5 to 15 working sets per muscle per week, of for all your muscles up to that point, that’s probably the best way to go about it, because you’ll get a huge return on investment. Probably optimal there. But then at some point you’re going to be like, okay, I can crank my volume higher because the literature is crystal clear that cranking your volume, as long as you can recover is probably a good idea. And so you say, okay, there are probably two ways I can crank my volume. One way is I can do more sessions per week, like some people will train three times a week and then go: “My gains are stalled.” and I’m like, hey, there’s nobody on the IFB Pro stage trains three times a week, my friend. The five is probably the average, so try five or try to go to four and then see how four is, go to five. see how five is. So I’d say that’s a good idea. And also specialization by saying, okay, I can’t train everything with 30 sets a week. That’s crazy. I’m human. I’m going to break into pieces. I don’t have that kind of time. And I say, okay, well, most of my muscles I’ll train from 5 to 15 sets. Normally they get the normal gains, and as an intermediate I’ll take, 2 or 3 muscles per mesocycle or per block, a few mesos in a row and really, like, start at ten and just keep cranking the volume up until I get really fatigued and can’t do it any more. And sometimes, you know, for forearms it’ll be 35 sets a week. For biceps that’ll be 30, and for pecs, that’ll be 25. But you get up to pec training 25 sets a week for a few weeks, and your usual is like 10 to 15, you’re going to almost certainly see gains. And so that cranking that volume is something that we almost never tell beginners to do, because it’s just a good way to burn them out. And the return on investment is so marginal for them to make any sense. But the margins change when your intermediate because your regular gains are so small that even slightly bigger gains on an absolute level are at relative level much bigger gains for you, especially the difference between 0 and anything else is infinitely better gains if you think about it. So it starts to be worth it. So I’d say that’s another thing that you could try, really pouring more work effort into it. And then usually… So for intermediates, I wouldn’t say this, but if you’re a more advanced intermediate, I would say it’s probably time to start to work through more exercises in the gym to try different movements. And we have so many movements to try. You’re putting out content to different movements. Milo pack. All the stronger by science people, Jeff Nipper, myself, etc. there’s tons of great people. There’s no shortage of different exercises you can try, and exercises are often very individually specific. Like you like leg extensions? Yeah. Like they really screw you up. My friend, James Hoffman, doctor James… Leg extensions just totally wipe him out. I was like, I can do, like, 5 sets of leg extensions to a pure failure and just smoke a cigarette after and do 5 more, this doesn’t matter. I barely get a pump. Almost nothing happens. But if I do like a high rep set of belt squats or leg presses I can like with one set get sore for three days and some people are like my knees just hurt, I don’t know what the hell you’re doing on there. There’s so much variation and so many ways to move your body in space. So the not only should you be trying different exercises, but slightly different techniques. Do you put the bench bar here on the incline? Do you put it here? Do you put a here? Do you do a guillotine press? Experimenting with that can allow you with a mind muscle connection not only do I feel my muscle moving, but like how much tension do I feel through my muscle? Is it the proper muscle that I’m feeling in this? Is it my feeling triceps in my presses or my pecs, am I getting sore after? So on and so forth. Are the muscles really fatigue? Is the rep drop off really high? Like if you do some kind of new hamstring curl and you rep drop off as insane, you’re like, I cooked my hamstrings. Something happened. And so experimenting like that over a long term can clue you in on what exercises… and also you can do this with the rep ranges and all this other stuff, exercises, technique variants, rep ranges, different split designs to try to see, like, what’s the thing that fits me the best? Because for a lot of individuals, some splits and reps and exercises are just going to be like, oh, oh, this is perfect. Over the course of my career, I’ve had this hundreds of times where I tried something new and I was like, that sucks. What I was doing earlier was better. And also hundreds of times where I tried it and I was like, what the hell was I doing before I figured out how to do this? And I would say that exploratory thing, like, again, it’s not going to be like the difference between night and day, but per individual, some people get some good gains from hack squats, but put them on leg press and they’ll blow up and not only blow up, they like the exercise and it doesn’t hurt their joints as much. They’re axial and systemic fatigue is lower and they can progress on it for longer. And all of a sudden, like even though unit per unit time gives you the same hypertrophy, you’re just going to be able to milk more out with that other one. You know what I mean? It’s like, like, comfortable versus uncomfortable sex positions. Like, oh, they all technically do the job, but you’re going to like some more than others. Try a bunch, see what you like. And if you’re at home alone, like me, then don’t try anything and just look at adult films. -Speaking of specifics… Which exercise do you think… For body parts, let’s start with… Start on the bottom – calves, exercises that people should definitely try or exercise that you recommend most often. Calves are not the most exciting, I guess. -Calves are not the most exciting. Any kind of straight leg calf raise that unloads your spine is probably pretty good. So get on the belt squat, if you have one, go step off the ledge unrack the weight, get the belt going and go down really low off the ledge, hold for two seconds, come up about halfway until it feels easier, and then go back down. And I would do that like mile rep style or a very short rest breaks. I did that yesterday and like I’m not gonna be able to walk most of the rest of the day. It’s just like insane soreness for calves. So I say that’s a good idea. If you’ve been doing seated calf races with a bent leg, I think you just you’re going to get the first calf gains of your life doing this sort of thing. What’s next? Hamstrings? A properly executed stiff legged deadlift is a very rare thing. And, a good morning as well. Same movement really. It’s just is the bar here or here. Because a lot of people will do them and they round their back which unlocks the hips, takes the tension off the hamstrings, they don’t go sufficiently low. So I would say a very good well executed stiff legged deadlift can basically mean that were 2 or 3 sets per hamstring workout. You can get all the stimulus you need, which is really cool. For quadriceps… -Let’s talk… what about the leg curl? Do you think it’s necessary to keep a leg curl movement in there for the short head of the biceps femoris for example? -So like, for beginners and intermediates absolutely not because no one’s going to be able to tell. Neither are you. And you can always start leg curling later in your career and just get, like, awesome gains for the first time ever. If you want complete muscular development and someone who would be stepping on stage, and time is a thing you can afford, I would say like, yes, it’s a very good idea to do some kind of leg curl. What I typically do is if I train hamstrings twice a week, I will do one day where I do hinges and one day where I do curls. And I think it just checks both boxes really well. I would say it’s not the best idea to miss out on either one of those, unless you’re time constrained. And then just do whichever one fits all of your other goals and preferences better. So if you’re like a strength trainer and you want big deadlift and stuff… It’s probably not important for you to be doing many leg curls. But if you’re a person who just only cares about esthetics but you don’t have a ton of time, then I would say mostly leg curls versus hinges are better because they’re a better stimulus to fatigue ratio in many cases. At least, the total systemic and axial fatigue is quite low, they don’t take as much time to do, and they technically probably contribute to a more complete development of your hamstring, especially if you do them in a lengthened position, like a seated like curl with your chest propped forward like that. -For quads you earlier, you already mentioned typically higher rep, very deep type squat movements? -Yeah. -That’s your fave? -Yea, a fave. I would say one of my all time faves nowadays is a really good belt squat. A good belt squat where you come down all the way and sit for like 2 seconds at the bottom, and you come up 2/3rds of the way and come right back down slowly, do a mile rep style, so you get very close to failure, lock out your knees, breathe for 3 or 4 seconds, maybe 5 or 10, and then hit it again and again and again. Do like three rounds of that. Like, it’s actually possible to get a very good workout for many people with 1 set like that. And I think it’s, the axial fatigue is non-existent because the weight attaches at your hips. The systemic fatigue is quite low because it really just kind of is almost only quads at that point, especially if you sit in such a way that…. glutes, but if you sit with your knees going way over your toes, it also doesn’t do your glutes much. A little bit, but not a ton. Also, your glutes leverage against your hips, which leverage to your spine. So if there’s a part of your squat, where are you going like this, glutes are involved, but if the belt is low on your hips, like, glutes don’t even really do much for that. It could be all quads or most quads, definitely some glutes. So, I would say belt squats are like a huge unlock that… I didn’t used to do them because I kind of thought they sucked. But when I, a friend of mine recommended that I do them a certain way, I tried, it was really good, I iterated on that, and I improved it in my own way, and I was like, okay, this is the best quad exercise pound for pound stimulus to fatigue ratio that I found for myself in a long, long time. -What about ABS? Is there even an exercise that you think most people should do for their abs? -I don’t even know if most people should be training their abs. It really just depends on what they want. I like abdominal exercises. Like I like my women: hard, painful, long… -So which exercise would that be? -I like my ab exercises to be based on the same principles as all other exercises. I want them to be a relatively full range of motion with a very long lengthened component. I want them to be loadable, and I want them to be progressable, and I want them to be repeatable in a certain fashion. So I think actually a well-designed abdominal crunch machine with a select rise stack is probably one of the best ab exercises you could do. You could also hold weights and do like an inverted bench, 45 degree invert bench, those are quite good. V-ups are decent. Roll outs, ab wheel roll outs are phenomenal, though they do tax your tricep long head and your lats significantly. Not a big deal, but like if you’re sore everywhere you’re like… It’s just, like, it’s a difficult exercise systemically. But, that ability to have the longest length concomitantly present the biggest tension is huge. Ab rollouts are a little bit difficult to progress. Though I will say, if you can do with what I consider very good technique, 20 ab rollouts, you’re like… I don’t know, we can run you over with a truck and your abs would be fine. But, so there you don’t really need external load in most cases, but I’d say a good resistance profile crunch machine where you really open up and you really crunch down, you really control eccentric and you really crunch down, I mean, I think that’s really, really hard to beat. I just, like, planks and all this fucking shit, I just think it’s such a goddamn waste of time for physique and strength people in most cases. -Yeah, I like the… having the cable attachments with the rope putting it over your shoulders, and then, like a Bosu ball or any type of ball that you can really crunch over to get the range of motion, then use the cable stack, because you can do that in almost any gym. And good ab machines are quite a rarity in the gyms. -What do you do with your feet? -Just put them on the ground. If you get… if you get the right angles it usually works up to pretty high weights. -Okay. -But after body weights you would need some, something to put your feet firmly in place. -Yeah. I have, quite strong abs, and I have very short legs, so I just flip backwards. -Right. -But if you get a bench you put your feet under or a couple of plates, then that can be an excellent exercise for pretty much everybody. -Yeah. For most people, I think, if you dip yourself way to the front of the, the ball, the leverage, it’s usually all right up to around body weight. After that you do start flipping over a lot. -Sure. -Moving to glutes. -Oh, yeah. -Best booty builder. -I mean, front foot elevated smith machine lunges are just really difficult to beat from an experiential perspective. When, like, you can get IOMS from them. Instantaneous Onset Muscle Soreness. When you do one set per leg, you’re like: “Oh, I got a cramp if I move. I got a lay down or some shit.” So it just… -What you think is up with that, by the way, the insane level of soreness that you get in the glute ham tie-in with those types of exercises. I think it’s because most people just don’t do them with a high enough volume and frequency to get used to them. I think it’s just a repeat bout effect. -But specifically the location, right? It’s like very, like, glute ham tie-in. -Is that the case? I don’t know, for me it’s just a whole glute. -I got like the insane… That’s also like the standard bodybuilding law, there’s not really a glute ham tie-in muscle, right? There’s just the glutes… -No. Yeah. Correct. Well, I will say, you know, we do have some data to support the idea of that longer length tension does hypertrophy you distally more and that’s distal part of the glute. And that’s, that’s kind of what it is, I’d say that’s probably something to do with it, but… You know like hip thrust are fine. Hip thrust suffer from a few theoretical problems, a few practical problems. So, you know, like one is that you have to load a fuck load of weight onto a bar. Another one is that, you, the force curve is just backwards. It’s also an isolation exercise, so you just like training glutes by themselves, which is fine if that’s what you want. But a lot of times, like, why not train other stuff too. Front foot elevated Smith machine lunges train your quads quite well, they trainer adductors really well, and they train your glutes into the moon. And train your cardio and your ballsack really well too, because fuck that exercise sucks. And it’s embarrassing because you’re on the Smith machine with like 10s on each side and everyone’s like: “What the hell’s wrong with that guy? His legs are huge, right? He’s so weak!” and you’re like: “You try this, motherfucker!” And I usually do it after quads, so my quads are cooked anyway. So it really is just 10s on a side. It’s kind of embarrassing. -What do you think is wrong with the force curve on a hip thrust? -It is very difficult at the top and at the bottom anyone can lift like 8,000 pounds. -Yeah, true… -And so… -I mean, Bret Contreras might argue that you get probably the highest active mechanical tension in the glutes at the top. So maybe it’s a good thing? You argue it’s too much probably? -I mean like if a force curve was half as extreme, that might be the thing. Also like active mechanical tension is nice. Passive mechanical tension also grows muscle also lengthened tension is so dominant now that it’s difficult to say like how much active tension at the top can counter that? Some. But is it not balance a thing? I’ll say this is where I’m like just currently pretty much by myself in the evidence base community with my bullshit proxies like pump and soreness and fucking shit like that. I do think I still going to win that debate in the end sometime. The pump literature has been very good to me recently. It correlates quite well with growth, we’ll see how that ends up. But I say, like if I do 5 sets of hip thrusts, I get a decent pump, I get a little bit sore, and it’s novel, I haven’t done it before. I’m like, okay, this exercise works. Like, Menno, imagine doing five sets per leg of front foot elevated lunges for first time. Like you won’t come back to the gym. The raw stimulus magnitude is just incomparable. And so I’d say hip thrusts are very, very excellent by the best isolation exercises for glutes or near isolation exercise. And a lot of people like, yeah, the competitive aspirations or they already did enough squats, They don’t want their legs any bigger but they want bigger glutes, man, hip thrusts are… They’re just very difficult to beat. The variety of ways to rig them… Whoever makes the following machine first is going to make a substantial amount of money: Just make a cam leveraged hip thrust machine that makes it very difficult at the bottom, very easy at the top, I will fucking buy one and I will talk about it on the internet and you will sell lots of them. It’s just obvious at this point and no one’s done it yet. So I would say that is a very, very good way to go. And you don’t even have to have some kind of magical construction design. You just have a lever system that’s angled properly at the beginning and that’s it. So the barbell hip thrust is just… it just leaves so much to be desired. And if I have to put six plates onto something that’s on the ground and it’s not a deadlift, I’m just not doing it. -Yeah, a lot of people have that, it’s not time efficient. -Oh my God! -What about, erector spinae? You think squats and deadlifts? That’s all you need? Do you do isolation work for them? -I mean, like, depends on for what? If you want to do, you know -Bodybuilding -Yeah, absolutely. Like, there’s probably no reason to train your erectors for bodybuilding. I would say for overall health I’m increasingly more and more led to believe that dynamic movements for almost every joint are a good idea for preventative measures and for injury prevention, for overall robustness. So I love to do flexion rows of various forms. Cable flexion row, dumbbell, barbell… And that’s where you actually bend at the spine. Ever since I started doing that, like my spinal health, back health has just been like amazing. And I do like combat sport and so my back is always in very precarious positions. The thing is, if you’re very, very strong, just with a locked in posture and someone unlocks you or you bend down to pick up a cup and you pull something in your back because you’re never in spinal flexion. That used to happen to me all the time. I was a decent powerlifter and it still happened to me all the time. So I think some spinal flexion and extension is just a good thing. And for hypertrophy, for physique like rarely. I have really cool like gnarly gigantic spinal erector so I kind of don’t want to lose them and sometimes want to make them bigger just because it’s sweet look. So for vibes yeah, you can do those. But I think having a spinal erector dedicated like… -Like back extensions. -Yeah, back extensions are just like just not a good exercise for so many fucking reasons. They’re not loadable very heavily unless you get the barbell out, then you end up hitting the supports. Fuck this. The force curve’s all wrong because it’s very easy at the bottom, very tough at the top. So on and so forth. So I think, and also like, why not train the rest of your back while doing it? So I just say just do a row with the back extension and there is a flexion row. I do love the way cable rows feel, with the full flexion, because actually, when you’re fully flexed at the bottom of a cable row, the angle of pull for your lats is even better. And so it ends up being just like one of the best all around back exercises that you can do. So I would say this is not very important if you’re doing bent rows and you’re doing stiff legged deadlifts and stuff, I think you’re totally good to go. With squats. your erectors are going to be big and strong. If you have struggle with some back stuff before, I would say starting very light high rep and moving up slowly in weight for flexion rows of various kinds or just like… or Jefferson curls… It’s just like one of the best things you can do for your back. -All right. What about lats? -One arm crossed… I’m kidding. So for lats, man, I just every single time I get away from it, every single time I come back to it, just good old pull ups with any grip… So good, man, they’re so goddamn good. Whether do you want to do them body weight, whether you want to do them weighted… I would say get your chin to the bar, roughly, and then, especially in the bottom two thirds, really milk that eccentric. And you’re not going to able to do that many reps, it’s kind of embarrassing. But you like every time I just cannot beat the DOMS I get and the pumps I get from pull ups with any other back exercise. I’ve tried them all. Nothing compares. Assisted pull ups are awesome, but regular pull ups, man. There’s something special about them. And like, that’s just for me. Some people do them… -You mean pull ups or chin ups? Any grip. -I do not, as I never use the word chin up, ever. I’m not upset that you used it. I’m a little upset. -Convention is like it’s a chin up this way, pull up this way… -Yeah. It’s just like… The exercise to me is called pull up… -You pull yourself up. -Correct. I could even say it’s just called a chin up and then it’s various grips. Cause there’s neutral grip, overhand grip, wide grip, underhand and so on and so forth. There’s also like 45 angle grip which feels quite nice for many people. So I would say like there’s just no wrong answer on grips. It’s whatever feels nice to you. And a lot of them, the right answer is variation. You know, like if someone’s like, hey do you like, you know, blond girls or brunettes or… You would be like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Like, I’ll take them all, goddammit. Not on the same session because, you know, tend to get upset at each other if they’re in the same bed. -What about, rear delts? You do them with your back training? Do you need to isolate them? -Yeah, you need to isolate them if your rear delts are lagging and you can do some rear delt work. That’s quite good. I would actually say one of my favorite exercises for rear delts is the Smith machine. You could do it with the barbell, too. In a rack, the Smith machine inverted row. So you get the Smith machine, you plank your body and you pull yourself and, pulling height can be here, it can be here, it can be here, can be here. Somewhere between here and here is where most people will find, especially if they bring their arms back. Dude, I get a fucking rear delt pump from that. I almost never get a real pump from anything. Also, you get a deep tension, high tension at the stretch. Easier at the contraction because the angle improves for you, vectors get easier and so it’s actually like a really good force curve. It also beefs up the rest of your upper back, which is dope. If you’re spending all of your time on, like, just a rear delts, it’s kind of weird. It’s fine. Then, you know, cross body or rear delt cable stuff is excellent. I hate the rear delt machine. It almost does nothing for me at all, you know, just it ends up being a back exercise. I would just prefer to do the elbows, elbows up and out, face pulls against a barbell. The leverage advantage. You know the TRX? You know what that is? The TRX bands? Those are actually excellent for it because again, they incorporate leverage advantage and with them you can start low and pull high or start high and pull low whichever way hit your rear delts better. I think that’s an excellent exercise. What I generally say to people is I almost always treat rear delts like I treat front delts. I almost never train front delts on purpose. I almost never train rear delts on purpose. Because if you do proper full range of motion back training, bro, if you look at an anatomy book and you look at any back exercise… Pull ups. Tell me rear delt… If you had a tear, like a fucking avulsion in your rear delt, you could do pull ups? No fucking way. It’d be the most painful thing in the world. Oh shit. It looks like they contribute a very large fraction of the force. A lot of people just forget, like like like this… Like… Well, hold on a sec… What other function is part of the delts? To do this. And this. And so you’re doing like 18 sets of rear delts anyway all the time. If you need extra-dope, but what I like to do is for my shoulder volume, all of my shoulder volume, almost all of it, I like extra on the side delt because the side doesn’t get much from pushing and pulling and also the side delt has by far the most visual appeal. Like if you have big rear delts like yeah, it looks cool, if you have big front delts, you look strong, if you have big side delts, like you probably gettin pussy right now, big homie, you feel me? You can’t bat the pussy away, man. It just keeps following you everywhere. -It’s funny, even for rehab there’s research that compound exercises, which anything that pulls the elbow back will train the rear delts, are just as effective as all the standard rehab type external rotation and stuff. -I don’t even know. Don’t even get me started on that shit. -What about traps? Do you isolate those more? -On an as needed basis. I almost never isolate them. I went through a phase where for, like a year and a half I isolated traps, and they got bigger. -Which ones? Middle, lower, upper? -Upper. So because like, so with the way I row with a low angle rowing like mid traps is just not a problem. And so lower traps definitely not a problem. Upper traps could use more work, but honestly like the way, if you do a lot of side delt training, especially with dumbbells and machines and cross body, I mean, like your traps are working. -Do you actively shrug? -No, but what I do is I try to focus on completing the movement with good execution, and I try to focus to make sure that I can feel it in my side delts, you know, like the “elbow up” cue like, pulling with your side delts. But I never, ever, ever try to de-emphasize my traps. And I think that’s a critical problem that many people run into, because the overall neural drive, you can get into a muscle or, he’s going to be limited by your bandwidth mentally of doing 50 other things and be like, okay, do your laterals, focus on your delt delts-okay, focus on not using your traps-okay, focus on your 2017 tax returns, think of all that and what was your first girlfriend’s favorite food? You’d be like, I don’t even fuck I’m doing anymore. You’re not going to get high neural drive. So what I usually tell people is focus on your side delts in side delt training, your traps won’t take over, they will contribute like they’re fucking supposed to. Like when you have people squat, do you tell them focus on your quads? Or do you tell them don’t focus on your glutes? I don’t even know how the fuck to do that. How do you not focus on something? It’s fucking insane. And it’s a big problem because you end up like using 5 kilos instead of 10 kilos, and then you end up just like… oh, the fucking… you know the guys doing this fucking one armed shit, like just to here. And I’m like, why don’t you go higher? Why don’t you use more weight and like fucking: “My traps take over.” And I look at their physique. I’m like: “What traps, motherfucker? You don’t even have any goddamn traps.” And here’s a really good news. If you are working on your biggest side delts that you can and you train them normally your traps will get almost as big or bigger than you’ve even wanted, and that’s amazing. You never have to train your traps. I’ve literally seen men in the gym, guys that are trying to isolate their delts, like with all this crazy shit to get the traps out and then they do shrugs later and I’m just like, did you misunderstand how… it just baffles… that baffles me… -In general, I think there’s a myth in bodybuilding circles that if you get more activity in one muscle group, it must come at the expense of another and research very clearly shows that’s not the case. -Opposite. You know, often case is like really strong triceps can push your pecs to go to limits they wouldn’t be able to before because like you can get the concentric up with more triceps than you’re supposed to and on the eccentric it’s all pecs and your pecs like, dude, I can’t even do this anymore. You can really push your muscles super hard. Do some people have a mind muscle connection problem with a certain muscle? Yes, but don’t worry about the other muscles. Literally don’t think about the other muscles. Think about your pecs. don’t worry about what your triceps are doing. Think about pushing through your pecs. Then you might get a little bit of better result. But like the whole “this other thing is taking over”… Usually it means you need to focus more on the muscle. Here’s another thing. It means your technique might use some work. You imagine someone doing very close grip bench and be like: “I just feel it in my triceps?” Like, oh no shit, motherfucker. Widen your grip a little bit. Some people like… Oh, I’m just getting catty. I don’t, I don’t want to be all negative. But some people like, will talk about mind-muscle connection and feeling a muscle, and you’ll watch them do an exercise of their doing this shit and you’ll like you shut up. What are you doing? Have you ever seen Jared Feather train? When you train like Jared you get to talk about mind-muscle connection till you’re blue in the face. If you don’t train like that, at least start training in a way that externally I can tell you’re like trying to do something organized. Like, I should be like, man, I can’t. I don’t really feel my back in rows and you watch them do rows and they’re like this. You know, like, I don’t I don’t know what you feel at all. I don’t feel my hips or my dick coming out. I don’t know. By the way, do you like my content? Then you’ll love my online PT certification course.

Okay, back to the video. Speaking of triceps and pecs, what are your favorite exercises for those? -So for the pecs, this is like an exercise most people won’t run into. But cambered bar bench presses are just like GOATed beyond recognition. -For the extra range of motion. -Oh my god bro, that extra three inches, let me tell you. Am I right? It’s so big. It’s so big. -But about the bench press now… -Say it again. -We’re talking about the bench press. -Oh, for sure! I… There’s nothing big in my life I would ever say about. So, it’s now 3.5in. The, the stimulus is just wild because, like, on all the technical grounds, like, it’s a very stable movement, it’s a very loadable movement. And it’s very, it’s movement’s easy to replicate technique wise. And all of a sudden it’s a three inches extra insanely difficult eccentric. It just blows your pecs into the moon. So I’d say that’s great. I would say properly executed incline dumbbell presses into which you take the proximal edge of the dumbbell and you touch it to the proximal edge of your bicep or the distal edge of your front delt. Make sure you hear that correctly. I am talking about touching the dumbbell like three inches deeper than your pecs. Because guys do dumbbell press and they stop here. Sometimes they don’t even touch their pecs and I’m like… Every time we have someone on RP, we’re training, We’re like, watch this, we teach them the technique And after one set they’re like, “Oh, oh, holy shit! My chest.” Like, yeah, that’s that’s like pretty straight forward. So those are good exercises. Deficit push ups are amazing. For some folks that want overall chest development and respond well, slightly lean forward dips are actually quite good. I love bench presses. I think bench presses are amazing for the chest. And almost everyone… I know some people don’t like them and I totally get it. Almost everyone that doesn’t like the bench press, or incline press for pecs is almost always doing it wrong. Like they’re not arching or contracting. They’re not controlling the centric, they’re not pausing. Like, of course your fucking shoulders hurt. But they think some of those core movements are just really tough to be. A good press machine is excellent, one that allows you to go really deep, like, that Atlantis machine and things. A lot of… you’ve been around the world, training…. You ever trained on Technogym equipment? -Yeah. -Is there a way we can get the United Nations to, like, cease and desist like Technogym from, like spreading their equipment all around the world? -There’s a few manufacturers that are extremely popular for no reason, that to me that seems related to the quality of the equipment, like force curves are terrible. -Terrible. -Range of motion is not good. They just don’t fit well. The movement. So it feels like a little bit awkward. -Yes. It’s like, I’ve done some of their like lat pulldown stuff and I’m like, I’ve never been able to feel elbow pain on a lat pull down until now. And no lat pump. Like how did you guys do it? -They have some okay… They have some okay machines, but… -That’s one hell of a compliment. -What about triceps? You need isolation work? -Yeah, yeah. Like if you want the biggest triceps, you are behoove you to do isolation work. -What type? Push downs? -So I love skull crushers. The barbell or Smith machine or inverted skull crusher, All to me the same class of movement, are amazing because they have almost the perfect force curve. Especially if you do inverted skull crushers because they’re easier at the top. Way harder at the bottom. And, just by leverage. So I think skull crushers are excellent. I think most people who say they don’t get a lot of skull crushers or their elbows hurt are doing the movement in a way that’s not good for the body, they experiment with different things. Skull crushers. To me, it begins… so there’s a spectrum from close grip bench all the way to overhead behind the neck extension. It’s a full spectrum. So you can do incline skulls. You can do skulls to a bench behind you. You can do skulls to your actual skull. You can do eyes, nose, mouth, chin, throat. That’s actually one of the best exercises I have ever taught anyone. My arms are slightly too big to do it at this point, but. But can you guys see’em, that’s right, that’s right. If you can do this it’s so unbelievable. Get a spotter. But do skull crushers. So unlock at your elbows, I would generally do a false grip because it seems to be easier on the elbows, in my experience, unlock, and then in basically a straight line, come down to where you gently touch, like, open your chin, gently touch and pause for one second with the barbell touching your throat. It’s a deficit. Menno, it fucks people so bad. And it’s just it’s just going to annihilate you. And like that class of movement, deep skull crushers, amazing. Push downs are awesome. I don’t like rope push downs because like they emphasize the contraction, which is the least useful part of the movement and the stretch is kind of always like eh. If you do push downs, I do like people to do the Jared Feather technique where they stay upright and as they bring the bar up, they pull their elbows back to get a deep stretch. I don’t like push downs out front. They’re cool. People are like, yeah, but fucking long head like, yeah, dope. There’s like 18 other ways to train your long head. One of them is just all back movements train your long head quite well. All pulling movements. The other thing is overhead work. I don’t do overhead work for my triceps anymore. Mostly because, I just got big enough to where like… You almost never see, like, like national level guys and pro level guys doing overhead, behind neck extensions. And you’re like, is it just a bro thing? And the reality is they just can’t put their arms there anymore. Like it just doesn’t work. I used to do them for a long time. -They’re too big. -Literally just too big. There’s too much stuff in the way. I did them for a very long time. Some of the very flexible guys can do it, and it’s always a beautiful thing. Unfortunately not in the cards for me, but I did them for years. I did them with a straight bar, I did them with EZ bar… EZ bar standing overhead extensions where you focus on… Your elbows can actually flare any way you want. It’s a decent cue to flare them forward, at least on the way down. Make sure your elbow is pushed really far ahead of you, so it’s like in a squat… You don’t want to squat back and down for your quads, you want to squat forward and down. And so in an overhead extension, you actually want your elbows to move forward as you come down as opposed to back. Now, back work great too but if you move them forward and down, you actually get the peak tension exactly at the peak stretch. And keep them nice and close. Like sets of 15 to 20. EZ bar… Just annihilation. It’s an amazing exercise. Fucks your long head up, fucks every head up. So overhead extensions with cables, with barbells, with EZ bars are awesome. So we have: skull variations, push down… So actually, to use the better anatomical procedure: push downs, skulls, incline variation and overhead. I would do some combination of all those rotated through the years. And I would say for most people, for full development, have some kind of movement that’s either a push down or a skull, one part of the week for triceps or a few of the days, and then one or a few of the days have some kind of overhead movement that you do. And I think it really squares away everything. Dips are excellent, but dips are one of those things like, like in the RP Hypertrophy App we have dips as a tricep exercise, but there’s some nuance there because it does hit your chest. It’s kind of like, oh, it’s kind of more 50-50… There are ways if you plank your body very vertical and when you’re dipping, instead of taking your shoulders and putting them really far forward, which is more chest you actually, this is really difficult, you break and then you let your elbows slide back, but keeping upright. It ends up making like this arm angle at the bottom and it’s fucking brutal. You’re like, oh, I can do 10 dips. Like everyone’s looking at you at the gym. Like this guy is an idiot. In regular dips he could put 225 on and go for forever. Those kinds of dips where you really extend your elbow out, phenomenal for triceps. What I like to do is, for many people to get quite strong, do like 5 sets of overhead extensions or push downs or skulls, and then go do 4 or 5 sets of dips. Holy shit. Like you’re going to do sets of 5 to 10 dips, and every set is going to be like your muscles just burning alive. And it’s all really good. -And then finally, the muscle that all the bros have been waiting for, the guns-biceps. -We did chest already, didn’t we? I’m an idiot. The biceps. So, like, at this point I’ve become like a trillionaire, spoiled bicep exercise enthusiast to where like, if you pick me up in a Mercedes and it’s not a Rolls Royce I’m like, oh, I’m sorry, sir, I’m waiting for my vehicle. And you’re like, I am the vehicle. I’m like, no, there’s been a misunderstanding. I’d never set my foot in one of these. So like barbell curls and shit, cable curls, like they fuck, they’re dope and they work, they’re effective, so they’re great. Feel free to use them. But once you’ve tasted the nectar of inclined curls with a very deep incline, lying curls, on a bench or what… probably my favorite all time bicep exercise… I’m not saying it’s the best, just I love it. Free motion behind the back curls. So really Bayesian curls, but with two arms at a time. And, just basically like the attachments, you step forward and you get the supports to basically be orthogonal to you here so that the cable is pulling back exactly at the bottom. Here you go really far behind your back. I actually did that line curls yesterday, my biceps are sore as fuck. And you pull really far back and then you come up and curl. At the very top here it’s super easy, which is exactly what you want. And you can back up rest for a second, keep going with myo reps. Easy to set up, easy to warm up for. I mean, it’s just like God’s exercise for biceps and it fucking looks lame. But god damn does it screw you up in the best possible way. And because it pulls your elbows back for you and everything, it’s actually, I think, amazing for shoulder health and elbow health because it really stretches the dog shit out of everything. So that. If you don’t have one of those free motion machines, I would say doing dumbbell curls, lay down on a bench and then take dumbbells, come out here, go all the way and up and down… Phenomenal, because the lengthened situation is amazing. The stretch situation is amazing and all of a sudden it’s just a great movement and very easy to do. Myo reps with is not systemically fatiguing. That’s another thing. You lie down and do bicep curls. Like you can do that until you’re blue in the face. Like when you get strong enough standing barbell curls are kind of annoying because like, I don’t know, do you get, like, I get my back gets tired from doing standing barbell curls pretty heavy. I’m just like, ugh… -Yeah. I’m not a big fan of barbell curls in general, -Which is a backwards force curve for hypertrophy. -You don’t get full range motion. You can, if you push your elbows forwards, it’s a little bit better, but then you actually do feel your core a lot with heavy weights. -Yes, yes Jared does that… The Jared curl like that but also like yes, you’re now you get the length and tension, but you’re no longer getting the stretch because you’re actually getting less stretch. And so it’s kind of like you could, you can you can rig curls to be good. Or you can do line curls or behind the back curls and just get like, amazing results. Yeah. -So two things we touched on a few times are good exercise technique, lengthened bias… Actually, third thing is progressive overload. Like to go into those things in bit more detail with problems that people currently face and the last studies. -Yeah. One thing with progressive overload, a lot of people have issue with… They increase the weight, they try to do more reps, but then it comes at the expense of technique. Mindset wise, training wise… How do you deal with maintaining good technique, not compromising range of motion while implementing progressive overload? -I’ll make an analogy here that’s maybe a little funny, but… it’s a stretch, but I think it has some wisdom in it. And I say, you’re hooking up with someone, right? You’re doing the deed. Anyway, sorry. I hope that sound comes through. You’re going back and forth at a certain amplitude… -Amplitude… -Amplitude, man… She’s like: “Oh my God, give me amplitude!” What? Stop picking up physics grad students. -”Increase force output!” -”Oh my God! Let’s do this in an accelerator!” You’re like, “I don’t know if that’s a good idea!” So how important is your amplitude? How important is your rhythm? How important is frequency? How important is all those things important for stroking. Right? How important is it that you are still inside of the vagina? I would say it’s of preeminent importance, because that’s the only place that that matters. It’s a stretch. It’s an exaggeration, but there’s some grain of truth to that that applies to technique. The purpose of technique is not for evidence based bros to be: “Good technique, bro!”, though it does do that. The purpose of technique is to put the tension where you need it to make the stimulus happen. And to keep you safe and to let you know like am I really progressing or am I bullshitting myself. Standardized technique. So technique to me is like a first principles. I don’t like the term first principles because there are many layers of principles, but a lower level of principle than how many reps you’re doing. It’s within the context of good technique, how many reps you’re doing. Here’s a better analogy. You’re doing a bicycle race and you decided to take a shortcut. You won the race, but they don’t give you a trophy and they say you can never compete again. And you’re confused. But I raced my bicycle to the finish line. No, idiot. You were supposed to go around this way, not through this way. Oh that’s right. So because technique allows us to maximize the stimulus, allows us to minimize injury risk and fatigue, and allows us to make sure that we standardize and we know our progression is happening, then technique is something we do not trade out ever. So people always ask me, when is your time to throw technique out the window? Like never. And certainly there are times where I can bullshit you and do nuance. And when I talk to bros, I got to be like, well, sometimes it’s fun, YOLO and all that shit. But real talk, I feel like for real though, like never. Good technique is good technique. And then everything on top of that is like, oh, I can’t do another rep if I use good technique. Good job. Your set is over. Well, I need more stimulus. Sweet, take five seconds of break and do a myo rep, or take two minutes and do another set, or do lengthened partials. But if you have to like, throw your technique off completely to do more reps, I think you’ve really like, you’ve made a fundamental mischaracterization of why you’re in the gym. You’re not in the gym to do reps, you’re not in the gym to… RP Hypertrophy App says 15 reps at 300 pounds, you’re not there to get 15 reps. You are there to stimulate the muscle, which means you do good technique and then however many reps you can with good technique. Is 15 the goal? Yes. Do 15. Can you not do 15? Then it’s 14 and you’re done. To me, Menno, it’s that simple. Am I missing something? -Mindset wise you basically have to get zero tolerance policy. You just have to… -Great question. Not zero tolerance in an insane OCD way because guys will be like, their elbows will do this, they say: “That’s it. I’m failing.” No no no no no no no no no no no. Fundamentally decent technique, right? So like sometimes you’re… We’re going to getting banned on YouTube for the shit I’m going to say. It’s going to use another vagina analogy. Like it is not true to say that your penis has to go all the way in every time and almost all the way out every time. Sometimes you can have a few mid strokes in there, sometimes a long strokes, but make sure it’s still in. Technique is how I look at it. Like, are you still doing the range of motion that you try to do? Is your ability to control your body still decent? Like if you’re doing dumbbell press, this is what a good rep looks like. This is what a bad rep looks like? Fuck it, send it, do another one. But if a bad rep looks like this, like bro, you’re done. If someone who’s a third day at the gym can tell you you have bad technique you’re not doing good technique anymore. So there’s a tolerance limit. But the tolerance limit is small enough to know, like I’m still doing the thing. Let me give you another decent analogy. Driving a car. Just don’t get half your car on the other lane. If your wheel hits this lane a little bit and then that lane, you’re good. But don’t drive on the fucking wrong side of the road. And I think most people, when they struggle with what’s perfect technique and what’s good technique, a lot of times they really know what it is but it’s very easy to give yourself the excuse to say, oh, my technique is not good anymore because you could push it further and still have decent technique. Here’s another thing. I’ll speak for Jared, though he’s not here. What Jared would say is this: when you feel that your technique is slipping, that’s when it’s time to have even better technique. Like, oh fuck. Like, oh, I don’t know if I can do this with a good technique. Sweet. Really retract and go again. But now think even more technique and even more strength. It’s not versus. It’s at the same time. It’s like, do I swing my sword around like this with zombies or I do like…. Well, no. You do the Roman short sword. It’s athletic, it’s fast, but it’s also precision. It’s both. It’s both, like, that’s the best way to describe it. So don’t get psychotic and OCD and be like, oh, as soon as my elbows are off… As soon as your technique feels off-fix it. Fix it right there for the next rep. And if you’re trying your goddamn best and your technique is really getting wacky, then it’s time to go. Technique is one of those things, like something they say about, like collapsing nations and armies and stuff is everything seems fine until the whole thing goes, you know. Technique is one of those to me where if you really try to focus on it again and it doesn’t work, then, you know, it’s no go. -Right. And how do you feel about the recent preprints that came out that’s show supposedly technique doesn’t matter? Yeah, for those that don’t know. Yeah, it’s a group of untrained individuals. It’s a limitation. Trained one arm with push downs and biceps curls. One arm did strict technique, elbow at the side, just the elbow motion, and then the other arm used a lot of body movements, body English where the push downs kind of turning into a dip, like lean into the weight and for the curls really swing up the weights and make sure you get the weight up kind of no matter what. And they got essentially equal gains in this eight week study. -I mean there’s a usual limitations of first of all it’s only a weak second of all it’s on untrained people. Another problem is one study at a time shows you almost nothing and then multiple studies together show you something. So taking all those limitations, I would say if we just say, okay, actually, this study is revealing the ground truth and this study turns out to be one of those, like, really middle of the bell curve studies after 20 studies are conducted. Let’s just assume that for experiment, for just like thought experiment sake. I would say what that studies illustrated is that you get roughly the same growth for if you cheat or if you don’t cheat. And there is a way to interpret that it doesn’t matter if you cheat or not. And that way to interpret that study is wrong. Because if you take your car and you drive 150 miles an hour, and you get to someplace weaving in and out of traffic and you get to that place at the same time as someone who drives 60 miles an hour and drives calmly, you can say, it just doesn’t matter how fast you go. And that’s true as far as the measured variable of how soon you get there. Because like, everyone ran into traffic and it just didn’t matter. But that’s looking at part of the picture. I’ve never heard anyone say that strict technique will have a very high effect of maximizing your direct stimulus to the muscle. I’ve never made that claim myself as far as I can tell. For some people the technique is so bad that that’s the case, but for most folks it’s just fine. So what I’m saying is if you do cheat curls your biceps will grow plenty big and strong. The thing is what are you paying? What are the costs? So you’re using more weight to get the same effect, or you’re doing more reps to get the same effect. -Which was indeed the case in this study. -Correct? You spend extra energy from all the other muscles of your body. You are needlessly exposing yourself to injury risk and fatigue. -Because of the higher weights? -Because the higher weights, because you’re doing more mechanical work. And the mechanical work… Imagine there’s another way to say this. Like the two groups did very different amounts of mechanical work. The cheat group did much more work, but only got the same exact results. Holy shit, why would you do that? And so if you think that doing cheat reps like bent rows, cheat bent rows, cheat curls, is going to grow you muscle. Well, you’re right, but how many more sets of bent rows could you have done if you just did strict technique and just had more energy to do more sets of bent rows? And how much better would your leg workouts go two days later because you didn’t use your posterior chain to lift half the weight? The answer is it’s meaningful and significant. And so what I would say is this study is hopefully one of many we’ll see in the future that I think probably will illustrate the fact that cheating is a fine way to get direct gains, but the stimulus to fatigue ratio is just highly suboptimal. The stimulus to risk ratio is highly suboptimal. There have been many people who have done strict curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people screw themselves up on… or sorry, strict curls, cheat curls that have fuck themselves up. Very few people get hurt doing strict curls. And so at the end of the day, it’s like if I’m taking all of these other risks and imposing this much fatigue on the rest of my muscles, on my system, on my spine, what else am I getting out of it? And the answer is nothing. Well, gee whiz, man, that means really, that good technique is a really good thing. And to me, the study is just a really good partial recognition of the fact that good technique has really big upsides. So we did not need a study on this. We could have reasoned through it. Good to have a study because our reasoning could be wrong. It’s never a good bet unless you have empirical testing. But, that’s the way I interpret the study is like, yes. So on mechanistic grounds, there’s I wouldn’t actually predict that you could have less growth. Like, I’ll put it this way… If the study discovered that there’s significantly less growth for the cheat rep condition, I would actually be a little bit confused. Like, fuck man, I guess my muscle connection really does matter a lot or something. Like maybe like, I don’t know, like the triceps don’t really get to failure because everything else did. It would really be confusing. And the high absolute forces on the eccentric and stuff like they help, they help, but apparently they don’t help enough. And so the stimulus to fatigue ratio, stimulus to risk is not great. And now it’s something that we can be more confident about saying. No doubt people will put out the study and comment and Instagram comments on YouTube about how technique is done and cheat reps work and it would just say that most of those people just haven’t thought it through sufficiently and most of those people aren’t the kind of people that need to think about things. They do have a feeling. And then they later do the very mild level of thinking on top of that, to justify their feelings. -Another area that we’ve had a lot of studies on recently that work mostly in the negative is the lengthened bias. So we had a lot of really compelling research initially coming out pretty much at the same time, an avalanche of research in favor of exercises with more lengthened bias, even lengthened partials beating full range of motion training. And then last month alone, we had meta analysis, well, October this was… Meta analysis showing that lengthened exercises have basically a trivial effect size in favor or over shortened exercises like training at longer muscle lengths does produce more growth, but it’s pretty much trivial. And then we had two studies in trained individuals showing pretty much equal growth with lengthened partials versus full range of motion training, in contrast to the basically two other studies, compelling studies that we had showing at lengthened partials even beats full range of motion training interestingly. And now we also have a study showing that, cable lateral raises didn’t significantly produce more growth, a bit of a trend… -I saw that… -than dumbbell lateral raises. So has the tide turned? Is lengthened bias still something you should seek out in your training? -If you look at all the studies together, there is still a clear relationship that the lengthened component is extra special. I don’t think it’s by like double or triple the growth. I never thought that. I think it’s by a margin, but I think it’s one of those things where if you can easily do exercises that accommodate a longer length, if your stimulus proxies also agree, like it gets you way more sore, way more pumped, way more locally fatigued, and has allowed you to progress faster and see better visual gains than I would say, because you have full decision about what to do in the gym, I would say my best advice, and this has been the case for a long time, if you can manage to, don’t skip the deep bottom stretch of an exercise and pick exercises that load the deep bottom stretch extensively. Whatever else you do, do you want to do partials? Sweet. Do you want to do full range? Cool. Do you want to squeeze at the top? Dope. But if you have an exercise in which you’re missing that like bottom half or the bottom half is there but with like incline curls, it’s just not loaded. I say probably not doing your best to get the growth that you want. Is it marginal? Absolutely. Could you just do more sets of shortened partials and still get the same growth? Yeah, definitely. Stimulus to fatigue ratio. Does that make sense? No, not a ton. I think the local fatigue imposed by lengthened partials is massive. But that’s what you want. For similar or lower systemic fatigue, which is good. So I say my my best tentative conclusion for now, this could change, is at the very least try to have most of your exercises not obviously skip the lengthened component and try to load it extensively. Does that mean you should be doing lengthened partials for everything? I’m not confident enough to say that yet. The recent literature has not been kind to it yet or so far, and so I would say at the very least, just don’t skip that bottom part and really focus on it and whatever else you want to do is kind of like, no one really knows what else is better. Just for a bunch of functional benefits and stuff I think full range of motion is kind of cool. And so what I would say is… and there was a direct study on this a little while back where it was like emphasizing the lengthened component with full range versus just lengthened and they got essentially the same results, I’d say, like, yeah, like… That’s more or less how I train much of the time is emphasizing the bottom stretch, but still going through most of the top. -Right. It makes sense. I think in general, a big confusion is that people have, with fitness research they interpret something as like this is now debunked. -Yeah. -Whereas if you look at it purely empirically, like, like a statistician, many of the things we recommend that we have in common, even though we disagree on some things, is that almost all the things we recommend purely statistically, even if you don’t know the mechanisms, you have no idea if this study is good, that study is good, but research overwhelmingly shows it’s either positive or neutral, and the chance of it being detrimental is very small. -Yes. -And you could make that argument with high frequency training, with lengthened partials, like with partials maybe not so much, but at least making sure that you stimulate muscles at long muscle lengths. -Yes. -It’s going to be either positive or maybe at worst neutral. But, based on the current literature, the chance of it being harmful is really, really small. -Yeah. Yeah, harmful or missing out on obvious gains. -Yeah. -Which is the biggest harm of all. -Yeah. -Yeah, 100%. And I think people often also mistake or just don’t understand… Not to their, you know, not trying to, you know, disparage anybody, but like, effect sizes are just something people don’t really know. Most people think, they just don’t know the difference between significance and effect size. And just to sort of clear this up. So significance is like, can you even really say you’re looking at two different things? Even though they might be very, very like someone’s like, okay, here’s significance, ready? You get two different species of South African ant, and a really like deep dive insect person would be like, yeah, those are two different species. They look the fucking same. They’re both tiny and damn near equivalent, but they actually are different. But are they different in any meaningful way? Like well, this one not bite me? Like no, they both fucking bite you. Like, okay. Do they behave differently? Like not really, they’re about the same. But they’re different. We know they’re different. That’s significance. So when someone’s like, oh, this is significantly better. Like, you know, it’s almost certainly really better. Effect size is by how much better. And so it’s kind of like, oh, oh, here’s actually a better one than the ant analogy. You get 2 pro boxers, a guy that’s ranked #1 and a guy that’s ranked #3. Is it true that the rank one guy is significantly better? Yes. Is it true that the effect size of him being better is high? No. Every third match he lose to the other guy and also, if you look at a guy at a club and he looks at you wrong, you’re like, “The fuck is that guy?” Like, “Oh, that’s the boxer dude.” You’re like “Yeah, what’s his rank?” Like? “He’s #3.” Like “I’m going to fuck him up!” Like, no you’re not. No you’re not because you’re ranked nothing And he’s going to… he’s like ten times the boxer you’ll ever be. That’s effect size. So we go back to the exercise science literature. People will say, you know like lying leg curls are inferior to a seated leg curls in many experiments. True. Significant. So they’re different. But like lying leg curls are like the, #3 boxer and seated are like #1, like they’ll both fuck you up big time and the differences between them are nuanced and also if you match up to that #1 boxer and like, you have some kind of advantage where you’re like, you’re a southpaw or you have really big reach, you actually have better results against the #1 guy then against the #3 guy, the #3 guy comes way into your circle too match, his uppercut game is out of this world, his body shots are gnarly, and while that #1 guy can neutralize him, you can’t. And so it’s actually better for you to be fighting the #1 guy. And for some people lying leg curls work definitely better than seated leg curls. And if you do seated leg curls for six months straight by novelty alone lying leg curls will be better. That’s how close it is. And I think some people will confuse those two. They’re different by a margin versus they’re meaningfully different in a way that you can apply and that’ll take things like, oh man, like so we don’t do anything at a shortened length anymore. Like, no no no, they’re still great, but like, it’s probably true to say that on average it’s a little bit better to emphasize the lengthened component, and it’s a bit of nuance there, for sure. The reality is like, you know, go to the gym, read the literature, do generally the stuff that’s a good idea, experiment with the stuff that maybe you don’t know about, the stuff that’s not as good-try it anyway and see if you like it and if you like and it works for you, great. Fucking do it. But, don’t pretend like, you know, some things are just categorically just night and day better than others. Those things do exist, for sure, but they’re mostly like, how do I get my quads bigger? Is it doing bicep curls or is it doing leg extensions? Like, yes, you will see very big effect sizes there. -Mike Israetel, everyone. I would tell you to promote your products or anything, but everyone on this channel knows who you are.

ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) ByJason Kirsch, CFP(R) , Contributor. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI ... [+] infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. The artificial intelligence revolution is quickly reshaping industries, economies and investment strategies. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) consistently capture investor attention in this space. While both are recognized as major players in the AI ecosystem, they represent fundamentally different approaches to capitalizing on the technology's exponential growth. This article examines these AI powerhouses through multiple lenses: their core business models, technical capabilities, financial performance and prospects. We'll analyze their strengths, weaknesses, and positioning within the evolving AI landscape to determine which might represent the superior investment opportunity for different types of investors in today's market. Artificial intelligence has evolved from a theoretical concept to an increasingly mainstream commercial reality. As of early 2025, we're witnessing the rapid proliferation of generative AI applications across industries following the breakthrough success of large language models. Organizations worldwide are racing to implement AI solutions to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and create innovative products and services. IDC projects global AI spending to surpass $300 billion in 2025, with a compound annual growth rate exceeding 25% through 2028. The AI infrastructure market has become particularly critical, with demand for specialized hardware, chip, and software platforms creating supply constraints and enormous business opportunities. Recent developments, such as the Chinese research lab DeepSeek demonstrating the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of traditional computing power requirements, challenge conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite such disruptions, major tech companies, including Meta Platforms, Alphabet, and Amazon have doubled down on AI investments, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025, Alphabet projecting $75 billion, and Amazon potentially exceeding $100 billion in AI-related investments. Before weighing these companies as investment opportunities, it's essential to understand their distinct business models, revenue streams and approaches to AI. While both operate in the broader AI ecosystem, they occupy very different positions. Palantir focuses on AI-powered data analytics software, while Nvidia provides the fundamental hardware infrastructure that powers much of today's AI revolution. Palantir Technologies specializes in data integration, analytics and AI-powered decision support platforms for complex, high-stakes environments. The company offers two primary platforms: Gotham, which serves government and defense customers, and Foundry, which targets commercial enterprises across manufacturing, healthcare and financial services. Both platforms excel at integrating disparate data sources into cohesive, actionable intelligence using sophisticated AI algorithms. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on "AI for the real world" – building systems that combine human judgment with machine learning to solve concrete operational problems rather than pursuing general artificial intelligence. The company has demonstrated remarkable success in securing government contracts, including significant work with defense and intelligence agencies, providing a stable revenue base with high switching costs once implemented. Palantir's commercial business has gained momentum more recently, with particular strength in industries dealing with complex physical operations and supply chains. The company's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP), launched in 2023, represents its most direct play in the generative AI space, allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance. This "private AI" approach addresses critical data security and intellectual property concerns that have limited enterprise AI adoption. Nvidia Corporation, founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem, began as a graphics processing unit (GPU) manufacturer focused on gaming and visual computing. Over the past decade, the company has transformed itself into the dominant provider of computational infrastructure powering today's AI revolution. Initially designed for rendering graphics, Nvidia's GPUs proved exceptionally well-suited for the parallel processing requirements of neural networks and other AI algorithms. The company's business model spans hardware and software. Its primary revenue stream comes from designing and selling specialized chips – particularly its data center GPUs like the H100, H200 and the newer Blackwell series – which have become the industry standard for training and running sophisticated AI models. Nvidia's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. Beyond AI, Nvidia maintains significant gaming, professional visualization, and automotive technology business segments. However, its data center segment, driven by AI adoption, has become the company's most prominent and fastest-growing revenue source, contributing nearly 88% of total revenue. With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion as of early 2025, Nvidia has captured an astounding 98% market share in the data center GPU market, benefiting from its technological leadership and the network effects created by its extensive software ecosystem. Both companies play crucial but fundamentally different roles in the AI ecosystem. While Nvidia provides the foundational infrastructure enabling AI development and scale deployment, Palantir focuses on applying AI technologies to solve specific business and organizational problems. Let's examine their distinct approaches and capabilities. Palantir's strength lies in making AI operational and accessible to organizations that lack extensive technical expertise. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) enables clients to implement generative AI and other advanced capabilities within their existing data environments, focusing on the "last mile" problem deriving business value from AI technologies. This approach addresses a critical gap in the market between raw AI capabilities and practical business applications. What distinguishes Palantir is its focus on AI orchestration rather than fundamental AI research or development. The company excels at building systems integrating various AI models (including those from other providers) with an organization's proprietary data and workflows. This positions Palantir as an AI solutions provider rather than a technology creator, helping clients navigate the complexities of implementation and achieve measurable outcomes. Palantir is uniquely positioned to capitalize on emerging frameworks like the Stargate AI Project due to its specialized expertise in integrating disparate systems and data sources. As frameworks enable more AI systems to communicate and share capabilities, the complexity of managing these interactions within regulated, security-conscious environments increases dramatically. Palantir's proven ability to build mission-critical systems that maintain governance while enabling powerful analytics creates a natural entry point for the company to become a key implementation partner for enterprise AI deployments. Nvidia is the fundamental enabler of modern AI, providing the computational infrastructure on which virtually all large-scale AI development depends. Its GPUs have become the de facto standard for training and running sophisticated AI models, with the company maintaining a commanding market share exceeding 80% in AI accelerators. This position gives Nvidia unparalleled influence over the direction and pace of AI advancement. The company's AI capabilities extend well beyond hardware. Nvidia has developed a comprehensive software ecosystem, including CUDA, its parallel computing platform; various AI frameworks and libraries; and specialized tools for different AI applications. This combination of hardware and software creates significant competitive advantages and switching costs, as AI developers and researchers build their workflows around Nvidia's technology stack. Nvidia's influence in AI continues to grow through strategic initiatives like the CUDA ecosystem, enterprise-focused AI systems, and partnerships with major cloud providers. The company has evolved from simply selling chips to offering complete AI systems and development platforms. Its newest Blackwell architecture represents significant advances in AI computing capabilities, delivering vastly improved performance and energy efficiency compared to previous generations and helping maintain Nvidia's technological lead over emerging competitors. Both companies have delivered impressive financial results driven by AI adoption, but their scale, profitability profiles and growth trajectories differ significantly. Examining these metrics provides an important context for evaluating their relative investment potential. Palantir has demonstrated accelerating growth and improving profitability in recent quarters, achieving GAAP profitability for six consecutive quarters as of Q3 2024. The company reported revenue of $2.4 billion for the trailing twelve months, representing year-over-year growth of 27%. This growth has been driven primarily by commercial sector expansion, with U.S. commercial revenue growing at approximately 40% year-over-year, substantially outpacing government revenue growth. The company's gross margins remain robust at approximately 80%, reflecting the software-based nature of its business. Operating margins have improved significantly, reaching 20% on a GAAP basis, as Palantir has reduced stock-based compensation and scaled its business. The company's customer count continues to grow, particularly among commercial clients, surpassing 300 as of the latest reporting period. Palantir's stock has experienced significant volatility in early 2025. After surging to record highs following strong earnings in early February, the stock retreated sharply amid concerns over potential U.S. defense spending cuts, tumbling 30% from its peak. Despite this pullback, PLTR remains 17% higher year-to-date and has quadrupled in value over the past year, reflecting strong long-term performance. Analysts are divided on the recent sell-off—some view it as a buying opportunity given Palantir's central role in federal data initiatives. In contrast, others point to technical indicators suggesting further downside risk if key support levels fail to hold. Nvidia has delivered exceptional financial performance, establishing itself as one of the market's strongest growth stories. In its most recent quarter (Q3 fiscal 2025), Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. The company's gross margins have expanded to approximately 72%, reflecting Nvidia's strong pricing power and the premium value of its AI chips. Operating margins have similarly improved, exceeding 50% on a non-GAAP basis. Net income has grown even faster than revenue, trailing twelve-month earnings growing over 150% year-over-year. Nvidia's stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia's growth prospects. The accelerating adoption of AI creates distinct opportunities for both companies, though their positioning within this landscape differs significantly. Understanding how broader AI trends affect each company provides an essential context for evaluating their investment potential. Palantir stands to benefit significantly from the enterprise AI implementation gap, which is the challenge organizations face when moving from AI experimentation to operational deployment. As companies increasingly focus on deriving measurable business value from AI investments, Palantir's expertise in creating practical, production-ready AI applications positions it well to capture this growing market. Their AIP platform addresses the "last mile" problem in AI adoption. The company's "private AI" approach addresses critical concerns around data security and intellectual property that have limited enterprise AI adoption. By allowing organizations to securely connect their proprietary data to large language models while maintaining control and governance, Palantir offers a solution that balances powerful AI capabilities with enterprise requirements for security and compliance. Palantir is positioning itself as a critical middleware layer in emerging AI ecosystems, helping organizations safely expose their data to interconnected AI systems while maintaining security and compliance. With accelerating commercial adoption, improving financial metrics, and a long track record of successfully implementing complex systems integration projects, Palantir represents a higher-risk but potentially higher-reward opportunity to invest in the infrastructure layer that will enable practical AI implementation across enterprises and government agencies. Nvidia's position as the foundational infrastructure provider for AI development gives it unparalleled exposure to the growth of technology. As AI models grow larger and more sophisticated, the demand for advanced computational capabilities continues to increase, benefiting Nvidia disproportionately given its dominant market position. The company effectively captures value from the entire AI ecosystem rather than competing within specific application segments. The company's technological lead appears substantial and sustainable, with its newest Blackwell architecture maintaining performance advantages over competitors. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Nvidia's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 40x, represent a nearly 35% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio of 60x (March 6, 2025). Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of the low 20s. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by over 100% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Despite their strong positions, both companies face significant risks that investors should carefully consider. For Palantir, competition from established enterprise software providers and specialized AI startups represents a growing threat. Major cloud providers increasingly offer AI implementation and orchestration tools that overlap with Palantir's offerings. The company's exposure to government contracts, particularly in defense and intelligence, creates vulnerability to policy changes and potential defense spending cuts, as evidenced by the recent stock volatility. Palantir also faces political and reputational challenges related to its government work. This association creates controversy in some markets and may limit its commercial expansion in specific regions or industries. The company's relatively high valuation and recent stock volatility leave little room for execution missteps, with any slowdown in growth likely to result in significant share price fluctuations. Nvidia faces different but equally substantial risks. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. While major customers like Meta Platforms suggest that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, as newer AI models require more computational power for operation, these evolving dynamics create uncertainty. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet surging product demand. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, maintaining sufficient manufacturing capacity and efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting ambitious growth expectations. Despite its strong position, Nvidia's high valuation leaves little room for execution missteps, as evidenced by a 7% decline following Q3 earnings despite strong results. Palantir and Nvidia represent compelling but distinctly different AI investment opportunities, with the better choice depending mainly on investor priorities, time horizons and risk tolerance. For investors seeking exposure to the foundation of the AI revolution with proven financial results at a massive scale, Nvidia represents the more precise choice. Its dominant position in AI infrastructure, exceptional financial performance, and continued technological leadership make it a core holding for those looking to participate in AI's growth trajectory. Nvidia's broader diversification across multiple segments provides some insulation against volatility in any single market. Its exceptional margins and cash generation offer downside protection, while its proven ability to execute at scale reduces operational risk. Despite a premium valuation, Nvidia's market position, technological moat and the multi-year growth runway for AI infrastructure suggest continued strong performance, with analysts expecting 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth for fiscal 2026. Palantir offers a compelling alternative for investors seeking a smaller company with potentially higher growth upside and more direct exposure to enterprise AI adoption. Its improving financial profile, accelerating commercial growth, and positioning as an AI solutions provider rather than a pure technology creator differentiate it from other options in the space. Palantir's focus on making AI operational for organizations provides exposure to the "last mile" of AI implementation, representing a substantial market opportunity as enterprises move beyond experimentation to production deployment. While Palantir has significant long-term potential with its expanding AI and data analytics capabilities, it also faces substantial competitive risks. The company’s reliance on government contracts, niche enterprise solutions, and emerging AI ambitions make it vulnerable to disruption from larger tech players with more diversified offerings. If industry giants like Microsoft, Google or Amazon further develop their AI-driven analytics platforms, Palantir could struggle to maintain its competitive edge. In contrast, Nvidia is a proven market leader with consistent revenue growth, dominant AI and GPU technology and deep industry integration. As one of the key enablers of the AI revolution, Nvidia is shaping the future rather than just participating in it. While PLTR has upside, NVDA carries significantly lower long-term risk due to its brand dominance, scalable technology, and essential role in AI infrastructure. Bottom Line While Palantir and Nvidia represent strong contenders in the AI space, Nvidia emerges as the superior investment for most investors, given its dominant market position, exceptional financial performance, technological leadership, and crucial role in the broader AI ecosystem. Palantir offers compelling exposure to enterprise AI implementation but comes with higher execution risk and more intense competition. For investors with sufficient capital, a balanced approach might include Nvidia as a core AI infrastructure holding and Palantir as a more minor position offering exposure to enterprise AI solutions. As with any technology investment, maintaining awareness of evolving competitive dynamics and technological shifts remains essential for long-term success.

Title: The Fediverse Isn’t the Future. It’s the Present We’ve Been Denied.

For years, the internet has been shrinking. Not in size, not in data, but in ownership. A vast, decentralized network of personal blogs, forums, and independent communities has been corralled into a handful of paved prison yards controlled by a few massive corporations. Every post, every “friend,” every creative work—locked behind closed doors, and you don’t have the keys. The fediverse is a jailbreak. It’s not a product, not a single platform, it’s not something you can buy stock in or use to enrich yourself at the cost of our shared humanity. It’s a network of independent, interconnected social platforms, all running on open protocols like ActivityPub. It’s an ecosystem where you - not some incellionaire obsessed with eugenics - own your digital identity. Where your social graph belongs to you, not an algorithm’s shifting fucking whims. Where moving from one service to another doesn’t mean losing everything you’ve built and everything you’ve ever said. We’ve been trained to believe that the way things are is the way they have to be. That Meta, Google, and whatever the hell Twitter is calling itself today are the price of admission to digital society. That you can’t have discovery without algorithmic engineering. That the internet was supposed to become a shopping mall where every interaction is measured in ad revenue. But none of this was inevitable. It was built this way—on purpose. And the fediverse offers something else: freedom. This isn’t a utopian fantasy. It’s not a pipe dream, like web3’s non-existent decentralization. It already exists. Mastodon, Pixelfed, Lemmy, PeerTube, BookWyrm—these are real platforms, these are real people, these are real conversations. The problem isn’t that the fediverse isn’t viable. The problem isn’t that it’s “too complicated.” The problem is that the giants of Silicon Valley have spent 20 years convincing us that anything outside their control isn’t worth our time. And that’s just not bloody true. We’ve all seen what happens when social media platforms treat users as a commodity rather than a community. Creators who built entire careers on centralized platforms, only to see their reach strangled and manipulated by "bonus" programs and algorithms. Friends and networks erased overnight by corporate priorities and billionaire egos. Whole communities forced into digital exile because they didn’t fit the new monetization strategy. The fediverse is an escape from that cycle. It’s digital self-determination. The fediverse won’t succeed just because it’s better. It will succeed if and only if people choose it. If they reject the idea that being trapped in someone else’s ecosystem is just the cost of existing online. If they stop believing that “free” means surrendering ownership of your own connections, your own history, your own data. If they see that the internet wasn’t built to be a factory for engagement metrics and AI-generated content farms. It was built to connect us, not silo us to pad a wealth-extremist’s bank account. We don’t need billionaires. And we sure as shit don't need their vision for the future of our web. We need our vision. The fediverse isn’t a distant dream—it’s here, right now, waiting for you to step outside the walls and see what’s possible. The internet was meant to belong to everyone. And it still fucking can. We've all heard the saying. "Everyone is entitled to their opinion." But it's not quite true, is it? An opinion isn’t a birthright, and it ain't a free pass to the conversation. It’s not something you wake up with, fully Fuck it man. Just put on some Grateful Dead. Put on some Aretha. Print some kind of zine. Paint a sign. Start a band. Write a manifesto. Bootleg a t-shirt. Hand out stickers. Throw a party. Keep it weird. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870 cast a long shadow. France, humiliated and burning for revenge. Germany, rising and certain it had to strike first to stay on top. Every decision, every alliance, every military maneuver was shaped by one core belief: another war wasn’t just possible—it was inevitable. A blog about stuff

Title: Jamaican tech workers targeted by recruiters, attracting high salaries

A United States-based fintech firm is currently recruiting at least 20 software engineers for a project here in Jamaica that will see them earning a starting salary of $10 million per year. But insiders in the tech sector say it is not unusual for foreign companies to scout local talent, some of whom migrate to take up positions elsewhere, while others work remotely here in Jamaica. Intellibus, described as one of the fastest growing companies in the United States and which is at the forefront of artificial intelligence and platform engineering, is looking for about 20 to 25 tech graduates to create a hub in Jamaica to service its clients in the US. To find the right persons, the company is organising a hackathon in which groups of students and potential employees will collaborate in solving problems, using coding to test their suitability to join the Intellibus team. “We know of the BPO sector, which hires 60,000 people, but the question is, how do we create a robust software sector, which requires a higher level of productivity and where employees can demand higher pay. For the Jamaican economy to really be transformed, the conversation must be, how do we boost the economy to the next level through productivity through the service sector?” Aditya ‘Ed’ Watal, founder and principal of Intellibus, told the Financial Gleaner. The India-born Watal spoke on the impact of AI on the job market at the Jamaica Stock Exchange’s Regional Investments & Capital Markets Conference in January, and returned a few weeks later to set up his Jamaican project. Watal said his company usually employs only one per cent of the persons interviewed, but said the bar had to be lowered for the Jamaican operation, meaning, about 500 persons will be interviewed. “I am trying to run an experiment that says, can I hire 20 people who are able to do similar jobs to the people that I have in the US today, are those people available and can I find them quickly enough?” Watal said. The entrepreneur said, based on his research, software engineers in Jamaica have a starting salary of US$35,000 per year (about $5.5 million). He said Intellibus is willing to pay about $10 million per year. A software developer with more than 30 years in business confirmed that only persons with a master’s degree and at least 10 years’ experience would normally command a $10-million salary. Watal said a similar project he tried in Cyprus, a member country of the European Union, was unsuccessful, but he believes it will be different in Jamaica. “We tried an experiment like this in Cyprus, but we did not scale it because, geographically, it was too far, and the economic advantage was also not as much. We weren’t getting a huge price break, because (Cyprus) is still part of the EU,” he said. Watal said in the US, his company has to pay top dollar for talent to compete with the likes of Google, Microsoft and Meta. Meanwhile, technology consultant Christopher Reckord told the Financial Gleaner that there is very little recent data on the size of the tech sector. He said, however, that most jobs now require some level of knowledge of technology. “When I started in this industry we were providing technologies and tools, running cable, and installing networks and computers in offices. All these things were connected by a wire; Wi-Fi never existed. A massive leap forward four decades later and we are communicating right now with technology that didn’t exist 40 years ago,” Reckord said. Reckord indicated that many other companies from abroad recruit tech workers from Jamaica, some doing so through LinkedIn and other social media sites. More than 500 persons graduate from the University of Technology, Jamaica, UTech, and the University of the West Indies, Mona campus with degrees in computing each year. The UTech annual report for 2019-20, the latest year available on the institution’s website, showed that there were 758 undergraduate offers in the School of Computing and Information, which is in the Faculty of Engineering and Computing. The bachelor’s degree in computing can be completed in either three or four years. Meanwhile, at UWI Mona in 2022-23, there were 1051 students registered in the Department of Computing across the three years of the bachelor’s degree. With technology rapidly changing the work world, the Statistical Institute of Jamaica is also changing how tech jobs are counted in labour force statistics. A representative at Statin said that while the Jamaica Industrial Classification, JIC, for industry workers underwent a review in 2024, the new classification has not yet been published. In the previous JIC in 2016, tech jobs were represented in the industry group ‘information and communication’. Statin last estimated the size of the information and communication employed workforce at 17,200 persons. luke.douglas@gleanerjm.com
