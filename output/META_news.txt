Title: A $5 billion deal key to CoreWeave's AI empire just lost another investor's support

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. A large shareholder in Core Scientific, a data center developer and operator, said he would reject a proposed purchase of the company by the rival data center firm CoreWeave in an upcoming shareholder vote. "Under the math of the deal today, I would have to vote no," Trip Miller, the founder of the investment firm Gullane Capital, told Business Insider on Friday afternoon. Gullane, based in Memphis, Tennessee, is the third-largest shareholder in Core Scientific, behind Vanguard and BlackRock, and owns a stake in the company worth about $200 million. Miller's opposition adds to other recent pushback against the deal, casting doubt on one of the year's largest data center mergers. CoreWeave — the AI cloud darling racing to scale its computing power — needs the roughly $5 billion takeover to help it continue to grow rapidly and also cut billions of dollars in soaring costs. But a dip in its stock price has weakened the offer's value, exacerbating investor concerns that the deal sharply undervalues Core Scientific just weeks before shareholders are set to vote on the transaction. On October 14, Two Seas Capital, another investment firm that owns about 6.3% of Core Scientific's stock, published a lengthy presentation that outlined its myriad objections to the takeover, including that it was not profitable enough for stock owners. The firm urged investors to reject it in the upcoming shareholder vote on October 30. In response, the CEO of the Livingston, New Jersey-based CoreWeave said the acquisition was "the most compelling path forward for Core Scientific stockholders" and that the present deal would be its "best and final" offer for the company. "The combination will offer Core Scientific and CoreWeave stockholders the opportunity to benefit from the tremendous upside potential and long-term value creation driven by greater verticalization," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO, wrote in a letter published on October 16. Intrator said the complaints from Two Seas Capital were "misleading and misinformed." CoreWeave's rapid, debt-fueled growth has thrust it into the center of a growing debate over whether AI speculation has become a bubble or if early movers like it are seizing on a historic investment opportunity. In July, CoreWeave announced that it had reached an agreement to buy Core Scientific in a stock conversion deal that valued Core Scientific at roughly $9 billion at the time and $20.40 per share — a 66% per share premium over what Core Scientific stock had then been recently trading for. But in the ensuing months, the economics have shifted as CoreWeave's shares have dipped and Core Scientific's have risen. The stock conversion deal currently values Core Scientific's shares at around $17, more than 10% below its market price of about $19 on Friday.CoreWeave and Core Scientific did not respond to requests to comment. "This is not a popular deal, I think for one simple reason: it's a flawed structure," Miller said. "It would be a deal that would value my shares, actually, at a discount to what they currently trade for today." Since a shaky initial public offering in March, CoreWeave has raced to a $70 billion market capitalization — more than three times its value after the IPO — and a place at the forefront of the booming data center business. It has announced blockbuster deals with some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, and the chipmaker Nvidia, and has spent billions of dollars snapping up AI developers and cloud providers to broaden its capabilities and customer offerings. In the company's second-quarter earnings call, Intrator said that its biggest customers required the development of infrastructure, including data centers, on a "planetary" scale. "We are aggressively expanding our footprint on the back of intensifying demand signals from our customers, ensuring that we maintain a durable, multi-year runway for growth," Michael Intrator, CoreWeave's CEO and cofounder, said in the company's second quarter earnings call. CoreWeave said it is expanding its roughly 470 megawatts of operating data centers to more than 900 megawatts by the end of 2025 — enough power to light up about a fifth of New York City on an average day. The Core Scientific acquisition would more than double that by operational megawattage and expand the company's pipeline of contracted future power by 50% to more than 3 gigawatts. Revenue for CoreWeave in the second quarter was $1.2 billion, more than double the same period a year prior, the company reported, and its revenue backlog of $30.1 billion had doubled since the beginning of the year — demonstrating its tremendous business prospects. Its operating margins, however, fell from 20% to 2% year over year, a sign of how costs are increasingly eating into the company's profitability. The company reported its debt had grown to $11.2 billion at the end of the second quarter, a 40% increase from the beginning of the year, and that its borrowing costs ranged from 7% to 15% on its various loans. Gil Luria, an analyst who covers the company, has raised concerns about the high-cost borrowing compared to the company's slimmer profit margins. "They're selling $20 bills for 15 bucks," Luria said. "Sometimes we forget to ask ourselves if this business should even exist," Luria said. "I'm not sure the answer is yes." Acquiring Core Scientific would streamline some of CoreWeave's mounting overhead. CoreWeave rents roughly 270 megawatts of data center space from Core Scientific, and owning the company would allow CoreWeave to save about $10 billion in lease payments for that space over the next 12 years, it has said. "They realize how important this is to the long-term viability of their business model, owning the economics around their largest cost, which is data centers," said Raul Martynek, the CEO of the data center developer and operator DataBank, which is not involved in the deal. Martynek said that Intrator's response letter signified the CEO was making a "full-throated defense of their offer" to purchase Core Scientific. Among the concerns outlined in its presentation, Two Seas said that the deal didn't offer shareholders protection from stock fluctuations that have upended the economics of the transaction. "The initial headline deal price of $20.40 per share undervalued Core Scientific's intrinsic value and strategic value to CoreWeave," Two Seas Capital wrote. "Following one of the worst post-deal drawdowns in an acquirer's stock price since 2020; the current deal value of less than $18 per share reflects a take-under of Core Scientific." In his letter on Thursday, Intrator wrote that CoreWeave represents Core Scientific's only meaningful data center customer and that its business accounts for 76% of Core Scientific's revenue. Intrator added that Core Scientific investors should "think objectively about Core Scientific's stand-alone prospects and the significant risks involved" in rejecting the deal and remaining an independent company." Miller disagreed, stating that in a hot data center market, "the belief is, if you leave this company alone for 18 months, it's a $30 to $40 company" per share, and that he felt it could be a more lucrative acquisition target.

US banking sector concerns sparked a sell off in Europe with major banking stocks in Ireland and the UK tumbling, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, and Barclays. The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 1.83 per cent on 11,438.22. Few of the big stocks ended in the black. Kerry Group was one, ending the day 0.78 per cent firmer on €77.45, alongside healthcare services group Uniphar plc, which was up 0.13 per cent. Irish Ferries brand owner Irish Continental Group also went against the tide to close 0.34 per cent ahead. The losses were led by Bank of Ireland and AIB which fell 5.7 per cent and 3.47 per cent respectively amid fears over credit quality in US regional banks which rippled through markets on Friday. Permanent TSB Group got off more lightly, falling 0.43 per cent to end the week on €2.29. Listed home builders also suffered, all ending in the red. Cairn Homes was down 2.07 per cent to €1.896. Glenveagh Properties was off 0.87 per cent and Irish Residential Properties REIT fell 1.07 per cent. Further share price drops came from wind and solar energy group Greencoat Renewables – down 2.62 per cent – and titanium minerals miner Kenmare Resources, which shed another 2.5 per cent at the end of a difficult week for the group. London’s benchmark index hit a two-week low on Friday, weighed down by losses in heavyweight lenders that joined a global sell-off in financial stocks. The benchmark FTSE 100 ended down 0.9 per cent at 9,353 points. Though off its session lows, the index still marked its second consecutive week in the red. The banks index shed 3.1 per cent. HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered fell 3 per cent, 5.4 per cent and 3.2 per cent respectively as investors revived memories of the crisis of confidence that shook sentiment just over two years ago. Defensive sectors were among those in positive territory, with personal goods, beverages, personal care, drug & grocery and utilities reflecting the cautious mood among investors. The aerospace and defence index dropped 3.5 per cent, tracking losses in European counterparts. Among other movers, precious metal miner Fresnillo slumped 11 per cent as gold and platinum prices tumbled. Pearson gained 2.5 per cent to the top of FTSE 100 as the education company expects stronger sales growth in the fourth quarter. Man Group gained 6.3 per cent after the hedge fund’s growth in assets under management surpassed expectations. The continent-wide STOXX 600 index closed nearly 1 per cent lower but still managed to log a modest weekly gain of 0.4 per cent. European banks were down 2.5 per cent, with Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s BNP Paribas all losing between 3.3 per cent and 6.5 per cent. The flight to safety pushed gold to another record high of $4,378.69 per ounce. Luxury stocks helped cushion the broader market as Ray-Ban maker, EssilorLuxottica jumped 13 per cent on investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses. Luxury was the best performing sector this week, powered by LVMH, which beat forecasts and reported its first quarterly sales rise this year. Continental was up 11.3 per cent after the German auto supplier’s preliminary third-quarter sales came in at €5 billion – just in advance of its own consensus forecast. All three major US stock indices were struggling for direction in midafternoon trading on Friday, while gold pulled back from all-time highs after a record run. Worries over potential systemic credit problems in the banking sector abated the day after Zions disclosed it would take a $50 million loan loss in the third quarter and Western Alliance initiated a lawsuit alleging fraud by an investment firm. The KBW Regional Banking index advanced in a partial recovery from Thursday’s 5 per cent plunge. Amid cooling of tariff rhetoric between Washington and Beijing, analysts now expect third-quarter S&P 500 earnings growth of 9.3 per cent year-on-year, up from 8.8 per cent as of October 1st, according to LSEG data. – Additional reporting, Reuters, PA.

Title: Investor Insanity? The Degenerate Economy Index Up 130%
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/boazsobrado/2025/10/17/investor-insanity-the-degenerate-economy-index-up-130/
Time Published: 2025-10-17T13:35:05Z
Full Content:
ByBoaz Sobrado, Contributor. Howard Lindzon, co-founder and CEO of StockTwits, created an index in May 2023 that tracks companies enabling gambling, day trading, and memecoin speculation. It has returned 130% since inception. The index includes the cornerstone of the speculative economy. It holds Nvidia, Apple, Robinhood, Coinbase, DraftKings, and Bitcoin. These are the infrastructure providers for what Lindzon calls the Degenerate Economy, where investing has converged with entertainment and the lines between trading and gambling have collapsed entirely. Traditional investors find themselves in an uncomfortable position. While retail trading is generally considered to be uninformed, it effectively drives the market. Traditional investors can dismiss what retail traders are doing, or they can acknowledge that Howard Lindzon’s index has doubled the returns of conventional benchmarks while holding household names alongside controversial platforms. The performance gap demands explanation beyond simply calling market participants degenerates. Lindzon built the Degenerate Economy Index around 13 public companies plus Bitcoin. The portfolio divides into clear categories that reveal how speculation became infrastructure. The technology backbone includes Nvidia, Apple, Google, and Meta. These companies provide the computing power, mobile devices, cloud services, and social networks that enable 24/7 access to markets. Without smartphones and social media, retail speculation remains constrained to trading hours and requires desktop computers. The trading platforms include Robinhood, Coinbase, and Interactive Brokers. Commission-free trading, mobile-first design, and cryptocurrency access democratized speculation in ways that traditional brokerages never attempted. Robinhood alone has 24 million funded accounts, most under age 35. The derivatives infrastructure includes CME Group and CBOE. These exchanges provide the futures, options, and volatility products that professional and retail traders use for leveraged speculation. The existence of 3x leveraged ETFs and weekly options expiries reflects demand for higher-risk instruments. DraftKings represents the sports betting category. The company went public in 2020 and now operates in 25 states with 5 million monthly active users. Sports betting legalization following the 2018 PASPA Supreme Court decision created an entirely new category of speculation accessible from phones. Bitcoin itself holds a position in the index. Not as currency or store of value, but as the original digital speculation vehicle that introduced millions to 24/7 trading and extreme volatility as entertainment. The index has seen only about 10 changes since inception. This represents high conviction in the infrastructure thesis rather than trading around momentum. Lindzon is not betting on which memecoin wins or which sports betting platform dominates. He is betting that the infrastructure enabling speculation continues growing regardless of individual winners and losers. The 130% return over 18 months occurred during a period of significant market uncertainty. Interest rates rose from near zero to 5.5%. Regional banks collapsed. Commercial real estate faced existential questions. Geopolitical tensions escalated. None of this mattered to the Degenerate Economy Index. Robinhood stock increased from $8 in May 2023 to over $40 by January 2025. It currently trades at $130. Coinbase moved from $50 to $330 over the same period. Nvidia returned over many multiples as AI demand for GPUs accelerated. DraftKings doubled despite increasing competition in sports betting. The performance occurred because the infrastructure providers collect their rake regardless of whether individual speculators win or lose. Robinhood earns revenue from payment for order flow, margin interest, and premium subscriptions. Coinbase charges transaction fees on every trade. Nvidia sells chips whether they mine Bitcoin or train AI models. CME Group collects fees on every futures contract regardless of who profits. This represents the fundamental insight behind the index construction. Lindzon invested in the arms dealers, not the soldiers. The casinos, not the gamblers. The platforms, not the users. More conservative market participants may argue that this rewards the casino-ification of markets. They point to Robinhood's gamification features, Coinbase's promotion of questionable tokens, and DraftKings' advertising targeting young males with gambling problems. These criticisms are accurate. They are also irrelevant to whether the companies generate profits and grow user bases. Three technological convergences enable the Degenerate Economy and show no signs of reversing. Mobile platforms provide the foundation. The iPhone launched in 2007 and Android followed shortly after. By 2023, global smartphone penetration exceeded 6.8 billion users. These devices enable what Lindzon calls "living life with a wallet on your phone" where stocks, crypto, sports bets, and NFTs sit accessible with a few taps. The friction of desktop trading and phone calls to brokers disappeared. Social networks provide the distribution mechanism. StockTwits, which Lindzon founded in 2008, now has 6 million users discussing markets in real time. Twitter financial content reaches hundreds of millions. Reddit's WallStreetBets has 15 million members. Discord servers coordinate trading activity. Information that previously required expensive Bloomberg terminals or Wall Street Journal subscriptions now spreads instantly and free across social platforms. Blockchain and cryptocurrency provide the rails for 24/7 global trading. Markets that previously closed at 4pm EST now operate continuously. Weekends on StockTwits trend with memecoin tickers rather than traditional stocks. Coinbase reported that approximately 1 million tokens per week are being created as of January 2025. The barriers to launching speculative instruments have collapsed to near zero. The economic context makes these technologies particularly potent. Housing affordability in the US reached its worst level in decades. Student debt exceeds $1.7 trillion. Wage growth lags asset price appreciation. For younger cohorts priced out of traditional wealth building through homeownership and stable employment, high-risk speculation represents a rational response rather than irrational exuberance. Commentators have coined the term "financial nihilism" to describe this phenomenon. When you have nothing to lose, perceived risk changes dramatically. A 23-year-old with no realistic path to buying a house may reasonably conclude that risking $5,000 on memecoins or sports betting parlays offers better expected value than saving for a down payment that never arrives. Sports betting provides the clearest quantitative evidence of speculation becoming entertainment. The Wall Street Journal reported in January 2025 that America is "addicted to parlay bets." Studies show sports betting significantly reduces household savings and increases credit card debt among financially constrained households. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates $14 billion in social costs from problem gambling, with 38% of male sports bettors aged 18-49 reporting betting more than they should. Crypto adoption follows similar patterns. Coinbase has 108 million verified users. MetaMask has over 30 million monthly active users. These numbers represent genuine adoption rather than speculative bubbles that burst and disappear. The infrastructure exists and users remain engaged even when individual tokens collapse. Market structure has fundamentally shifted in ways that benefit the index holdings. The top 10 stocks now represent 38% of the S&P 500, matching dot-com bubble concentration levels. Passive flows create what Epsilon Theory's Michael Green calls "a giant mindless robot" market where price discovery occurs through flows rather than fundamental analysis. Social sentiment now leads price action rather than following it, and its global. South Koreans stream live perpetual futures trading like esports competitions in what they call "T-POP" (Trading as K-POP). Similar phenomena emerge in India and China. This is not an American cultural quirk but a global transformation in how markets operate. Lindzon himself expressed doubts about the thesis in August 2024. "The term 'degenerate economy' is sloppy in that I do not want to glorify the idea that you are on your own. I take pride in helping people learn the language of the markets. My utopian idea of this economy is that 'speculation is entertainment' and 'investing is a sport'. That is not happening." He considered changing the terminology but ultimately continued using it while emphasizing education and risk management. The discomfort stems from observing friends joke about investing in gambling addiction treatment centers as a growth industry. The normalization of behavior that previous generations would consider pathological creates ethical questions that performance data does not answer. The January 2025 launch of Trump and Melania memecoins crystallized these concerns. The $TRUMP token hit $60 billion in initial valuation three days before inauguration. This represents a massive wealth transfer from retail speculators to insiders rather than democratization of finance. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum's founder, experienced a crisis of faith in February 2024: "Do I feel good when I hear people from crypto twitter and VC firms telling me that PvP KOL degen casino that's money-losing for over 99% of its own users is the best product market fit that crypto is going to get?" This captures the tension between builders wanting utility and markets demanding entertainment. Traditional value investors see casino-ification killing price discovery and allocating capital inefficiently. When GameStop or AMC trade based on social media sentiment rather than business fundamentals, markets stop performing their core function of directing resources toward productive uses. These concerns are valid, but they do not make the Degenerate Economy Index wrong as an investment thesis. Investors face a choice. They can refuse to participate in infrastructure they find morally questionable and accept lower returns. Or they can acknowledge that opposing a trend does not stop it from generating profits. The Degenerate Economy Index provides a framework for the latter approach. By focusing on infrastructure providers rather than attempting to pick winning meme stocks, investors gain exposure to the trend without participating in its most problematic aspects. Owning Nvidia does not require endorsing AI girlfriends. Owning Apple does not require approving of mobile gambling addiction. Owning CME Group does not require celebrating leveraged speculation by retail traders. These companies provide tools that serve many purposes, some productive and some destructive. The counterargument holds that providing the infrastructure makes you complicit in the outcomes. Often people seek out “ethical” investments which avoid alcohol companies, casinos, tobacco, or any industry with negative externalities. Investors must decide their own ethical boundaries. For now, the performance data suggests that those boundaries cost money. The 60 percentage point gap between the Degenerate Economy Index and the Nasdaq-100 over 18 months represents real wealth not created for those avoiding the trend. Lindzon’s advice to his son Max perhaps illustrates a middle path: if you are going to make a parlay bet, invest an equal amount in the Degenerate Economy Index. The Degenerate Economy entered what Lindzon calls "Ludicrous Mode" in January 2025. The SEC rescinded SAB 121, allowing banks to custody Bitcoin. David Sacks serves as Crypto Czar. Robinhood, Visa, Wells Fargo, and Goldman Sachs all hit all-time highs simultaneously. Both old and new financial platforms benefit from the same trend. Traditional banks adding crypto custody compete with Coinbase while simultaneously validating the asset class. This represents market expansion rather than zero-sum competition. Lindzon predicts several developments that would further benefit index holdings. Vegas sportsbooks will morph into "degenerate economy clubs" combining gambling, trading, and entertainment. CNBC's Squawk Box could evolve into a global streaming phenomenon focused on trading as sport. On-chain peer-to-peer betting will expand to cover everything from stock movements to sports outcomes to prediction markets. The wealth gap will accelerate dramatically as asset owners vastly outperform wage earners. Retail participation may reach 30% of market volume, up from historical 20%, as platforms become more sophisticated. AI will replace traditional Wall Street analysts for many functions, further commoditizing financial research. For crypto specifically, Lindzon predicts that supply will crush demand. With 1 million tokens created weekly, most will fail spectacularly. This benefits infrastructure providers like Coinbase that collect fees regardless of which tokens succeed. The platforms always win. The question facing investors is whether this represents a temporary mania that will revert or a permanent transformation in market structure. The 18-month performance of the Degenerate Economy Index suggests the latter. The technological infrastructure exists and cannot be uninvented. The economic conditions driving participation show no signs of improving. The regulatory environment is becoming more permissive rather than restrictive. Traditional investors can question their sanity for participating in what they see as casino-ification of markets. The alternative is questioning their sanity for ignoring a trend that has doubled benchmark returns while showing no signs of reversal.

Title: Will the AI Bubble Trigger a Financial Crisis?

Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so closely correlated, the current US financial system looks like a tinder box just waiting for a spark to land on it. WASHINGTON, DC – OpenAI Co-Founder Sam Altman, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have joined the chorus of people talking about an AI bubble and expressing concern that the US economy will nosedive when it bursts. But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavors, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fueled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fueled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-center construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need – or prefer – to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets.

SUBSCRIBE NOW Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions – including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves – is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as greenlighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META is Alphabet's counterpart within the Interactive Media & Services sector that possesses: 1) A lower valuation (P/OpInc) in comparison to Alphabet stock2) Yet higher revenue and operating income growth This disparity between valuation and performance could suggest that investing in META stock is more advantageous than purchasing GOOGL stock Investing in individual stocks can be precarious, but there is significant value in adopting a broader diversified strategy as we do with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management – a wealth management firm in the Boston area – which has implemented asset allocation strategies yielding positive returns during the 2008-09 timeframe when the S&P declined over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into this asset allocation strategy to deliver improved returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; providing a smoother investment experience, as shown in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? OpInc = Operating Income, P/OpInc = Price To Operating Income Ratio Do these figures, however, encompass the entire picture? Read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock to determine if Alphabet still possesses an advantage that remains viable beneath the surface. For context, Alphabet (GOOGL) offers a variety of products and services, including advertising, Android, Chrome, hardware, cloud solutions, health technology, and internet services across diverse markets. This is merely one method for assessing investments. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio conducts a more comprehensive evaluation and is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing potential growth opportunities. A method to evaluate whether Alphabet stock is currently overpriced compared to other tickers would involve examining how these metrics compared among companies exactly one year ago. Specifically, if there has been a notable trend reversal for Alphabet over the past 12 months, then the ongoing disparity may likely reverse. Conversely, sustained underperformance in revenue and operating income growth for Alphabet would reinforce the notion that its stock is overpriced relative to its competitors but might not revert soon. OpInc = Operating Income Considering buying based on valuation, while appealing, must be assessed thoroughly from various perspectives. This multi-faceted evaluation is precisely how we develop Trefis portfolio strategies. If you desire potential gains with a more stable journey than an individual stock offers, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, delivering over 91% returns since its inception.

Business Shares in Ray-Ban maker EssilorLuxottica rose 14 per cent to hit an all-time high on Friday, adding nearly $20 billion in market value as investor enthusiasm for its AI-powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses gathered momentum. The Paris-listed group, founded by late Italian entrepreneur Leonardo Del Vecchio and a possible contender in the race to buy fashion group Armani, reported on Thursday third-quarter sales growth of 11.7 per cent from a year ago to 6.9 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The results beat expectations and marked the company's best quarterly performance ever amid strong demand for wearable products such as the smart glasses it has been developing with Meta since before the pandemic. Even though the smart glasses business has until now accounted for only a fraction of EssilorLuxottica's total revenue, it has become a focal point for analysts and investors, as well as a catalyst for the company's investments.

Title: $1,000 In Nvidia Stock 5 Years Ago Is Now $12,000 — NVDA Still A Buy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/1000-in-nvidia-nvda-stock-5-years-ago-is-now-12000-still-buy/

BySasirekha Subramanian, Contributor. Nvidia's financial performance has been extraordinary, making it the most valuable U.S. company at a $4.4 trillion market cap.Its market dominance stems can be attributed to the company's leadership, it's high-powered chips and a comprehensive, full-stack AI infrastructure strategy.Despite its stock run-up, valuation metrics indicate Nvidia may still be undervalued given its strong growth potential. A $1,000 investment in Nvidia (NVDA) five years ago would be worth more than $12,000 today. The chipmaker’s stock has enjoyed a remarkable run, fueled by surging demand for its high-powered GPUs amid the AI boom. This wasn’t a hype-driven rally. The stock never got ahead of its fundamentals; if anything, investors were late to recognize what Nvidia had been quietly building for years. When AI’s moment arrived, Nvidia was ready to embrace it. Over the last five years, Nvidia executed two stock splits: On Oct. 14, 2020, Nvidia closed at $14.05 on a split-adjusted basis. That means a $1,000 investment would have bought 71 shares. As of Oct. 14, 2025, Nvidia closed at $180.03 per share, making those 71 shares worth $12,782.13—a more than 12x return, and that’s excluding any dividends received along the way. For comparison, a $1,000 investment in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index, would have grown to $1,986.69 in the same period. The takeaway? Whether you held or missed out, Nvidia’s return has been extraordinary. What drove this exponential return? Nvidia’s strategic pivot — repurposing its powerful graphics chips for AI workloads — proved transformational as AI became a dominant investment theme after OpenAI released ChatGPT in late 2022. Though AI had been evolving for decades, ChatGPT made it tangible, accessible and personal for the mainstream.. Nvidia positioned itself at the center of the AI narrative, capturing demand from cloud providers, data centers and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure. In May 2020, Nvidia launched the A100, the first GPU based on its Ampere architecture. Delivering up to 20x performance improvements over the previous generation Nvidia GPU, A100 quickly became the gold standard for AI. Major customers included Alibaba Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Baidu Cloud, Cisco, Dell Technologies, Google Cloud, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle. After the launch, NVDA shares rose from $8 in mid May to end the year at $13.02, representing a gain of 63% Nvidia stock ended 2021 at $29.36, gaining 125% from the previous year’s close, as the Covid-ridden world embraced high-performance computing for remote work, gaming and data analytics. Demand from crypto mining also contributed to stock gains. In April 2021, Nvidia announced the general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a 3D simulation platform for creating digital twins and virtual worlds. A key attribute of the Omniverse is to create physically accurate visualizations and simulations of products and environments, reducing the time and costs of physical testing. Nvidia announced its first Hopper-architecture-based GPU, the NVIDIA H100, in 2022, calling it “the engine of the world’s AI infrastructure.” The H100 was designed to be deployed in every type of data center, including on-premises, cloud, hybrid-cloud and edge. While investor response to the H100 announcement was initially muted, the GPU would prove to be a critical enabler of large-scale AI workloads in the following years. ChatGPT’s release on Nov 30, 2022, marked an inflection point for AI. Nvidia stock jumped 8% that day — an early sign that the market was beginning to recognize Nvidia’s potential. However, by the end of the year, the Nvidia stock retraced to 2020 levels, wiping out its 2021 gains. A major reason was the crypto market crash, which significantly reduced demand for Nvidia’s gaming GPUs used by miners. The same year, Nvidia faced yet another setback when the U.S. government introduced controls to prevent the chipmaker from exporting its most powerful chips, including the A100 and H100 GPUs to China, threatening a solid revenue stream. The explosion of investment in generative AI in 2023 led to a surge in demand for AI infrastructure. With its H100 GPUs already in production, Nvidia became a clear beneficiary.. Both institutional and retail investors piled into the AI theme and Nvidia’s stock more than tripled over the year, closing 2023 near $50. Nvidia also crossed $1 trillion in market capitalization for the first time. The momentum carried into 2024. As major tech companies allocated billions of dollars to expand their AI capabilities, Nvidia's datacenter revenues soared. At its annual GTC conference in March 2024, Nvidia unveiled its next-generation Blackwell GPU platform, reinforcing optimism about its roadmap. In June 2024, Nvidia executed a 10-for-1 stock split to increase accessibility for investors. Later that year, Nvidia was added to the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average – a recognition of its market leadership. Nvidia’s financial performance has been equally impressive. The AI bellwether more than doubled its revenues for fiscal 2024 and then doubled its revenues again in fiscal 2025 in rapid succession. Positive investor sentiment drove record inflows into the stock, making Nvidia the most valuable company in the U.S. with a $4.4 trillion market cap. Recently, CEO Jensen Huang confirmed that the exponential demand for AI computing, particularly for the newer Blackwell GPUs, showed no signs of slowing down. With Nvidia stock setting new highs, some analysts are even forecasting a potential future valuation of $7 trillion, despite setbacks with China and intensifying competition from AMD. Nvidia’s decision to repurpose its graphics chips for AI was nothing short of visionary. Recognizing that the parallel processing architecture originally designed for rendering complex graphics was also perfectly suited for the intense computational demands of AI – marked a pivotal turning point and redefined the company’s future. The introduction of the Compute Unified Device Architecture in 2006 is Nvidia’s most significant differentiator. CUDA provided software tools that allowed developers to program Nvidia GPUs for general computing tasks beyond graphics. Thus Nvidia built a robust software ecosystem around its hardware. This early move created a durable competitive moat, fostering developer loyalty and driving long-term platform adoption. It meant that researchers and developers building AI models were already accustomed to Nvidia's software and hardware long before the AI boom truly kicked off, positioning Nvidia as the default choice for AI infrastructure. Unlike its competition, Nvidia focuses on building the entire AI infrastructure. Its end-to-end AI platform encompassing GPUs, CPUs, networking hardware, and full-stack software gives it the capability to build AI supercomputers, while enabling customers to deploy AI with greater ROI. Nvidia’s ability to deliver new GPU architectures with significant performance gains — such as Ampere, Hopper and Blackwell — has kept it consistently ahead of the curve. The company’s rapid iteration has made it the go-to provider for customers racing to keep pace with the computing demands of generative AI and large language models. Nvidia’s financials have been growing at a faster pace in recent fiscal years, leading to the sharp rise in its share price. Revenues have grown from $26.97 billion in fiscal 2023 to $60.92 billion in fiscal 2024 and to $130.5 billion in fiscal 2025. The growth in revenue has been accompanied by strong profitability. Operating income has grown from $4.2 billion in fiscal 2023 to $32.9 billion in fiscal 2024 to $81.5 billion in fiscal 2025 and earnings per share from $0.17 in fiscal 2023 to $1.19 in fiscal 2024 and to $2.94 in fiscal 2025. Nvidia has shown remarkable resilience, enduring the 2022 crypto crash that severely impacted its gaming segment and the current US-China trade tensions. China has been a key market for Nvidia; it represented $17 billion or 13% of Nvidia’s sales for the fiscal year that ended in January. But Nvidia’s market share in the region has weakened from 95% before 2022 to just 50% after U.S. regulators tightened restrictions on selling high-end AI chips to China over national security concerns. Instead of resisting policy constraints, Nvidia adjusted swiftly by introducing the H20, a watered-down version of its H100 GPU designed for U.S. compliance — demonstrating its agility in navigating complex regulations. With China turning away from its chips now, Nvidia is accelerating expansion into new markets, again highlighting its resourcefulness. Huang’s leadership remains Nvidia’s greatest asset. The visionary chief executive touted the transformational potential of AI long before it went mainstream and prepared Nvidia to be at the heart of the AI buildout boom. As a founder-CEO, he brings continuity, long-term strategic vision and assertiveness to steer Nvidia through a complex technological and geopolitical situation. Huang’s pragmatic leadership has been on display repeatedly: He lobbied effectively to ease U.S. restrictions on H20 chip exports, yet accepted China’s subsequent rejection of Nvidia’s H20 and RTX Pro 6000D chips with composure. Chinese regulators have reportedly directed companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to cancel orders for Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D processors, which are specifically designed to comply with U.S. export rules and serve the Chinese market. Instead of dwelling on the setback, Nvidia shifted strategy — assuming a “China zero” baseline in financial guidance and treating any China-related sales as potential upside rather than expectation. The recent U.S. approval to sell AI chips to the UAE drove Nvidia stock to new highs, and a deal to sell directly to OpenAI, bypassing traditional cloud partners — reflects the company’s evolving sales strategy. Meanwhile, Nvidia’s strategic investment in Intel points to initiatives to diversify manufacturing sources beyond TSMC, as Taiwan faces an ongoing geopolitical threat of invasion from China. This proactive de-risking underscores Huang’s forward-looking approach that continues to set Nvidia apart. Nvidia still has a long growth runway extending into the next decade. Last month, Nvidia unveiled Rubin CPX, a new class of GPU designed to handle million-token coding and generative video applications. Rubin CPX is offered in multiple configurations, including the Vera Rubin NVL144 CPX , which Nvidia says will enable companies to generate $5 billion in token revenue for every $100 million invested. Rubin is on schedule for volume production next year. Over the next five years, Nvidia expects to scale into a $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure opportunity with its Blackwell, Rubin and other successors. The AI infrastructure market continues to expand significantly with $600 billion in data center and computing-power investments expected this year. The key drivers for these investments include reasoning agentic AI that would require a lot of computing power, global build outs for sovereign AI, enterprise AI adoption, and the arrival of robotics and physical AI. Blackwell has set industry benchmarks for AI inference ROI. As agentic and reasoning-based models gain traction, inference workloads are scaling across sectors, positioning Blackwell as a core growth engine. Nvidia claims that its Blackwell platform delivers the highest ROI at AI factory scale and can generate $75 million in token revenue over three years from a $5 million investment. Token revenue is earned during an AI system’s inference phase, where it processes input tokens and generates output tokens to produce responses. The faster and more efficiently it handles each token, the greater the potential revenue the system can generate. Nvidia’s RTX Pro servers enable enterprises to build AI factories and accelerate enterprise workloads from agentic AI and LLM inference to industrial AI and digital twins. About 90 companies have already adopted RTX Pro servers, including Hitachi, which uses these for real-time simulation and digital twins, Lilly for drug discovery, Hyundai for factory design and AV validation and Disney for immersive storytelling. RTX Pro servers are expected to become a multibillion-dollar product line as enterprises modernize data centers. Sovereign AI has emerged as a growth pillar, as nations seek to build in-country AI infrastructure using Nvidia’s full-stack. Nvidia is working on Sovereign AI initiatives across The UK and Europe. The European Union plans to invest €20 billion to establish 20 AI factories in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, including five gigafactories to increase its AI infrastructure tenfold. Isambard-AI, deemed as the UK’s most powerful AI supercomputer, is powered by Nvidia. This supercomputer aims to accelerate breakthroughs in fields of drug discovery and climate modeling. Nvidia expects to achieve over $20 billion in sovereign AI revenue this year, more than twice its revenue last year. Networking, which is shaping up as a critical contributor for Nvidia, fetched second quarter revenues of $7.3 billion, up 98% year-on-year and up 46% sequentially. Strong demand across Spectrum X Ethernet, InfiniBand, and NVLink spurred the strong growth. Spectrum X, which is the world’s first Ethernet networking platform for AI, is now annualizing over $10 billion in revenue, accelerating from an $8 billion annual run rate in the first quarter. THOR, Nvidia’s new robotics computing platform is seeing early adoption from leading players like Meta, Amazon Robotics, Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Caterpillar, Figure, Hexagon and Medtronic. Robotic applications require exponentially more computing power and infrastructure, representing a significant long-term demand driver for Nvidia’s data center platform. Last but not the least, Nvidia’s near-term outlook looks upbeat. It sees third-quarter revenues of $54 billion, plus or minus 2% – implying a range of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion compared to the consensus of $53.1 billion. This is higher than the $46.7 billion in revenues it generated for the second quarter. The outlook assumes no H20 shipments to China. So, does Nvidia look like it’s slowing down? Even at record highs, Nvidia’s stock may not be as overvalued as it appears. Several valuation metrics suggest there’s still room for upside: These metrics suggest that, despite its impressive run-up, Nvidia stock may still be undervalued relative to its historical and sector benchmarks. Nvidia stock isn’t trading on hype The market is pricing in its AI leadership and perhaps even under-pricing the scale of its opportunity. Despite a hefty $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia remains deeply embedded in the multitrillion-dollar AI infrastructure cycle that continues to unfold. Nvidia isn’t some accessory to AI buildout, it is the backbone of the process. The company’s financial results continue to validate this growth narrative, with sustained momentum across key segments. Competition from AMD cannot be brushed off, but Nvidia’s full-stack advantage remains difficult to replicate. China is a near-term setback, but Nvidia is already expanding into other international markets. Nvidia’s dominance in data centers, sovereign AI initiatives and enterprise AI point to a multi-year growth runway. The recent dip in Nvidia stock presents a buying opportunity, in my opinion. Despite a nearly 1,200% surge over the past five years, Nvidia’s growth shows no signs of fatigue. No stock, including Nvidia, has a straight upward trajectory and periods of volatility are inevitable. However, pullbacks in Nvidia stock could offer attractive entry points for investors with a long-term view. As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs. How much would $1,000 invested in NVDA five years ago be worth now? A $1,000 investment in Nvidia shares five years ago would now be worth more than $12,000, excluding dividends. What was the main driver of Nvidia's stock price growth? Nvidia’s early and strategic positioning at the center of the AI boom — serving cloud providers, data centers, and enterprises racing to build next-generation infrastructure — fueled its extraordinary gains. Is Nvidia still a good investment today? As the buildout of AI infrastructure continues to accelerate, Nvidia stock appears well-positioned to set new highs, thanks to its dominant market share, cutting-edge technology and expanding end markets.

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts We’re back with another deep dive into the shifting landscape of venture capital, and this week we’re joined by a legend who’s seen it all—Roger Ehrenberg. Roger founded IA Ventures in 2008, building one of the most respected early-stage portfolios in the industry with investments in companies like The Trade Desk, Wise, DataDog, and Digital Ocean. After a successful run, he’s now back in the game with a new fund, bringing 25+ years of institutional investing experience (including stints at Deutsche Bank and CSFB) to bear on today’s radically different market. Joining him are Rory O’Driscoll from Scale Venture Partners, Jason Lemkin from SaaStr, and Harry Stebbings from 20VC for a no-holds-barred conversation about what’s really changing in venture—and what investors are getting dangerously wrong. Bottom Line Up Front: The venture capital playbook is being rewritten in real-time. Three seismic shifts are reshaping how investors think about returns: (1) AI companies are compressing the time from zero to billion-dollar valuations into months, not years, forcing investors to rethink traditional portfolio diversification strategies; (2) the concentration vs. diversification debate has become stage-dependent, with early-stage investors needing 20-25 initial bets before concentrating 75% of capital into 3-5 winners; and (3) the old social contract between founders and investors is breaking down when unprecedented wealth—like $3.5 billion offers—turns multi-period games into single-turn decisions. Meanwhile, the exit bar has doubled from $200M to $400M in ARR, extending the journey to liquidity by 2-3 years and fundamentally changing how investors should think about follow-on capital allocation. Goldman Sachs’ acquisition of Industry Ventures for $665 million (with potential earnouts reaching $970M) provided a masterclass in asset management valuations. The deal traded at roughly 10% of Industry Ventures’ $7 billion in assets under management—a valuation that reflects the economics of secondary markets and fund-of-funds structures. “If you manage 100 billion, the entity is worth 20 billion for someone like Carlyle or KKR where they own all the economics,” explained Rory O’Driscoll of Scale Venture Partners. “Here, which makes sense as a secondary because the economics aren’t typically quite as good as primary investors, it’s at 10%.” The transaction highlighted a critical distinction in venture: not all GP businesses can be sold. “You couldn’t do that with a venture firm, especially a small venture firm, because in the end, all you have is the three people, and if you cash them out 100%, then you don’t have anything,” O’Driscoll noted. For Goldman, the strategic rationale is clear: access to high-fee private assets at a time when public market management fees have compressed to single-digit basis points. The firm’s Apex platform for ultra-high-net-worth clients provides immediate distribution for Industry Ventures’ products. Roger Ehrenberg, founder of IA Ventures and now back in the market with a new fund, emphasized the business model distinction: “Hans built an asset management business. The rest of us here do not run asset management businesses.” Andrew Tullik’s departure from Thinking Machines—a company he co-founded and helped raise $2 billion for at a $10 billion post-money valuation—to join Meta for a reported $3.5 billion sent shockwaves through the venture community. Not because founders leaving isn’t common, but because of what it signals about the new rules of engagement. “In the face of unprecedented wealth, I’m shocked to discover that most people behave badly,” said Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr. “Something’s broken in the way that we’re evolving as humans if everything ultimately reduces to what’s in it for me.” But O’Driscoll offered a more clinical perspective: “Once you’re not playing a multi-period game, and when someone’s offering you $3.5 billion, you’re no longer playing a multi-period game. You’re playing a one-and-done. You’re going to get bad human behavior.” The financial calculus is stark. “Would you prefer $2 billion in Thinking Machines unlisted stock with a chance to be amazing or a chance to go bust, or $3.5 billion of liquid Facebook stock over the next 5 years?” O’Driscoll asked. The answer, as Ehrenberg acknowledged, was obvious. This raises profound questions about how investors should adapt. Extended founder vesting, cliff vesting, and repurchase rights are becoming standard protective measures. But the deeper issue remains: when the core asset of these AI investments is “a group of seven engineers,” as O’Driscoll noted, the traditional founder-investor relationship may simply not apply. “The unusual thing as a career trajectory for an engineer—spending 14 years at Meta, bouncing to OpenAI for less than a year, then to Thinking Machines for less than a year, then back to Meta—that’s not crazy,” O’Driscoll observed. “What is unusual is because of the technical nature of these bets, how much reliance we’re putting on the behavior of an engineering/academic talent pool, which probably responds fairly differently than the ‘I’m a founder, I want to be the CEO’ talent pool.” SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son securing a $5 billion margin loan against ARM shares to invest more in OpenAI barely registered as news to veteran observers. “Masa rules,” said Ehrenberg simply. “This is Masa being Masa 100%.” The move represents smart use of leverage—Son still owns 90% of ARM’s roughly $90 billion market cap, giving him $80 billion in equity value to borrow against. A $5 billion margin loan at reasonable rates is “a relatively low octane Masa move,” as Ehrenberg characterized it, noting Son could easily lever up to $25 billion against the ARM position. “This man is full risk on all the time and just wants to get the bet on the table,” Ehrenberg continued. “He’s been spectacularly right at times and spectacularly wrong at times, but spectacularly willing to play, which on behalf of the audience we should be eternally grateful.” The broader context matters: where will the capital come from to fund the massive compute infrastructure AI requires? As Lemkin pointed out, “We’re now building more data centers than office buildings,” with demand for tokens growing exponentially as companies deploy AI agents and applications. The conversation revealed just how far we are from meeting current AI compute demand, let alone future needs. Lemkin shared firsthand experience: “I’ve vibe coded eight apps in 100 days. We have 12 AI agents working at SaaStr now. What I can tell you is today, just what we’re doing today with 12 agents and eight apps, I could use 100x the tokens.” O’Driscoll pointed to recent scaling research that takes a remarkably matter-of-fact view of the investment required: “A whole bunch of these folks are like, ‘Yep, this is the task we’ve embarked on ourselves for the next 5 years and it’s going to take around 1% of GDP to build a compute cluster big enough to get the flops to get the outcome we want.'” The scaling laws have held for six to seven years at high degrees of accuracy, creating confidence that continued investment will yield continued progress. The question isn’t whether the technology will advance—it’s whether the economic returns will justify the capital deployment. “If it’s slowed down, it won’t be because the technology direction is incorrect, it won’t be because the demand isn’t insatiable,” O’Driscoll argued. “It will be purely and simply that the marginal capital provider says, ‘Oh my god, even though the scaling law is holding, the economic return from that investment isn’t holding.'” When Polymarket raised at a $9 billion valuation and Kalshi immediately followed with a $5 billion round from Andreessen Horowitz and Excel, it sparked renewed debate about whether capital can “kingmake” winners in venture. The reality, as Ehrenberg explained, is pure regulatory arbitrage: “This is the purest regulatory arbitrage play of all time. You can look at the cumulative market cap of regulated sports betting and look at how it has dropped in response to the rise of Polymarket and Kalshi, who are not subject to the same rules and regulations.” But O’Driscoll pushed back on the kingmaking narrative: “I don’t think anyone betting on Polly or Kalshi gives a damn how much money they have, provided they can pay their bet, and gives a damn who that money came from.” The distinction matters: kingmaking requires either (1) giving one company so much capital they can overwhelm competitors, or (2) brand-name VCs creating customer preference through their backing. Neither applies to prediction markets, where user loyalty is driven by liquidity and payout reliability, not VC pedigree. “What’s going on here is two non-sports betting companies who are doing ‘prediction markets’ where all we talk about is the 10% of the revenue that’s political and 90% of their business is sports betting, but we’re not calling it that,” O’Driscoll observed. “They’re just killing it because we all love to sports bet.” The discussion revealed sophisticated thinking about how portfolio construction must evolve as the venture landscape changes. Ehrenberg laid out his approach: 20-25 initial portfolio companies, then concentrating 75% of total capital into 3-5 winners through aggressive follow-on investments. “Where I’ve tended to get very concentrated is on the second and third checks, where we’ve gotten deep conviction in a team, their execution, in the market,” Ehrenberg explained. “Three to five companies out of the 20 to 25 constituting 75% of the capital deployed.” The strategy requires treating each follow-on check as an independent decision. When Trade Desk raised its Series A at $280 post-money, Ehrenberg wrote a $3 million check out of a $50 million fund—after having already invested over $2 million across four earlier rounds. That single check turned into $40 million. “We look at every check independent of the check prior, period,” Ehrenberg emphasized. “If I look at that and say the information I’ve got about this being a $300 million or $3 billion—I think this could be a $100 billion company—then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” O’Driscoll pointed out the temporal dynamics: “You have to start off with a significant element of diversification and then concentrate down. We’ve moved from a world where an exit is $200 million in ARR to a world where an exit is $400 million in ARR at an IPO. The finish line has receded another two or three years, which means logically you’ve got more risk and more upside.” Founders Fund’s evolution from 31 investments in Fund I to targeting just 10 in Fund III sparked debate about optimal concentration levels. The key insight: concentration strategy depends entirely on stage and conviction. “The more certain you are that you can call the shots, the more focused you should be,” O’Driscoll noted. “Founders Fund both has the evidence that they can call the shots because they’ve done so, and frankly the confidence to call the shots because they got it right.” But even for growth-stage funds, pure concentration has limits. O’Driscoll was surprised Founders Fund I had 31 investments: “It just didn’t feel in sync with what we’ve seen from these guys in general. I mean, if you look at their SpaceX non-diversification, these guys strike me as the most likely to be most concentrated.” The distinction between growth and early-stage investing matters profoundly. “When you’re still at the ‘will this thing even work’ stage or ‘will it scale,’ you probably need some significant diversification and then concentrate when you’re effectively investing in what should be public companies but are just private,” O’Driscoll argued. “Then the growth fund strategy should be 10 or 11 or 12 deal concentration.” Lemkin offered a contrarian view from his concentrated seed approach: “I’m doing 8% of my fund into almost every deal. I have to have such a high hit rate at seed. Half of them have to work. So it’s a stupid model because you have to turn away Clubhouse and Hop In and maybe even DataDog, but you got to just find the Wises and go all in.” Harry Stebbings challenged the group with a critical observation from his Fund I experience: “When I look back over six years, the best performers—your Linear of the world—were not obvious early, and the early outperformers did not signify enterprise value in the long term. Clubhouse, Hopin, BeReal. If you think you can pick your winners early, I think you are wrong.” Ehrenberg pushed back with nuance, citing dramatically different paths to success across his portfolio. Trade Desk experienced “multiple near-death experiences, multiple exit opportunities, bridging multiple times, didn’t have a product in market for more than a year and a half.” Wise, by contrast, was “as close to an up-and-to-the-right company as I’ve ever been involved with.” The key is recognizing you’re playing “a multi-turn game,” as Ehrenberg emphasized. His first check into Wise was $750K at $5.5M post. “Then AR came in and we piled in with AR to $20M, then we piled in with AR to $160M, and we just kept going. We were 17% of TTD at IPO and we were 13% of Wise at IPO out of a little shitty seed fund.” O’Driscoll validated the uncertainty while offering a path forward: “You don’t always know, but you know more than someone coming in from the outside. So at the margin, you can tilt it your way. And that’s all you can do.” The group agreed that once companies have 12-24 months of revenue data, conviction increases dramatically. O’Driscoll noted Scale’s analysis showed that “if you get the first two years that we underwrote in terms of revenue from the moment of our investment, your probability of getting greater than a 5x goes from 30% to mid-70s.” Lemkin raised the practical challenge facing seed investors today: “What are you going to do when you got in at $8 million post, but the next round’s at $300M or $500M because the AI kids come in? How much of your fund can you really put in? Is it even worth writing that second check?” Ehrenberg’s answer was unequivocal: “We are hyper-disciplined. We look at every check independent of the check prior, period. If I look at that and say I think this could be a $100 billion company, then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” He cited the Trade Desk Series A as example: after writing four small checks totaling just over $2M, the company raised at $280M post. “We wrote a $3 million check out of a $50 million fund into that at a $280 post. That $3 million ended up turning into $40 million, and that was a great investment.” O’Driscoll reframed the concern: “What you’re saying is if all the following rounds are priced incorrectly relative to ultimate exit value, does your strategy work? It’s a fair question. But if the worst thing that happens is my initial check gets marked up and on the follow-on I don’t need to chase the money, then I’m money good on the check I’ve written.” Ehrenberg summarized it perfectly: “It’s a cash-on-cash business. If the rounds trade up to the point where the follow-on round doesn’t have the return, so be it. The worst thing that happens is my initial check is money good, and provided every check you write is money good, in the end you’ll die rich.” One tactical approach emerged as particularly valuable: maintaining parallel LP bases across funds to enable cross-fund investing without conflicts. Ehrenberg explained how this transformed IA Ventures’ flexibility: “All of a sudden we weren’t investing out of a $100 million fund. We were investing out of a $260 million fund.” The strategy requires careful LP base construction from the start. Ehrenberg recalled an early situation where Fund I and Fund II didn’t have matching LPs: “The LPAC was like, ‘Yes, if you want to do it, go do it. Just understand, if this doesn’t work, you got some explaining to do.’ The risk of that check was not simply financial, it was reputational. Ultimately, we ended up deciding not to write that check.” With parallel LPs across later funds, the constraint disappeared, enabling aggressive follow-on capital deployment into breakout companies without creating cross-fund conflicts. O’Driscoll validated the approach while noting the limitation: “Any cross-fund you do is going to be a good deal, otherwise you’re an idiot. So I think good deals you can find follow-on checks where you can cross-fund, even if the LPs aren’t fully aligned between funds, provided you run a process.” The discussion returned repeatedly to one of Peter Thiel’s key lessons about follow-on investing: when a big, reputable outside investor does a follow-on round at what feels like a high price, do everything you can to get into it. “It’s not always true, and I could cite examples where it’s not true,” O’Driscoll acknowledged. “But risk-adjusted, information-adjusted, that next round in the deal that you’ve been in that’s performing well, provided the follow-on price is contemplatable, the advice would be: adjust your scales upward, or don’t be guilty of anchoring on what you did.” The key is recognizing the information asymmetry has shifted. External investors seeing enough signal to lead at elevated prices possess different data than those who invested earlier. As O’Driscoll put it: “You got to find a way to take into account the information since then, both operational and the outside round.” This connects directly to Ehrenberg’s framework of treating each check as an independent decision based on current information, not past pricing. “Everything in life you can price as an option,” Ehrenberg noted. “I walk through life. Everything looks like the Greeks. Everything looks like options theory, because that’s life.” On Portfolio Construction: On Follow-On Capital: On Founder Retention: On Market Dynamics: On Capital Deployment: Roger Ehrenberg on follow-on discipline: “We look at every check independent of the check prior, period. If I look at that and say I think this could be a $100 billion company, then I will write a very meaningful check into that company, up to about 10% of the fund.” Rory O’Driscoll on founder departures: “Once you’re not playing a multi-period game, and when someone’s offering you $3.5 billion, you’re no longer playing a multi-period game. You’re playing a one-and-done. You’re going to get bad human behavior.” Harry Stebbings on portfolio strategy shifts: “I’ve realized even at our stage, you got to be trying to do that more and more because the journey from our stage is still 10 years now, whereas before it was six or seven.” Jason Lemkin on token demand: “I’ve vibe coded eight apps in 100 days. We have 12 AI agents working at SaaStr now. What I can tell you is today, just what we’re doing today with 12 agents and eight apps, I could use 100x the tokens.” Harry Stebbings on early-stage prediction: “When I look back over six years, the best performers—your Linear of the world—were not obvious early, and the early outperformers did not signify enterprise value in the long term. If you think you can pick your winners early, I think you are wrong.” Roger Ehrenberg on investment outcomes: “If the worst thing that happens is my initial check gets marked up and on the follow-on I don’t need to chase the money, then I’m money good on the check I’ve written. Provided every check you write is money good, in the end you’ll die rich.” Rory O’Driscoll on early-stage uncertainty: “You don’t always know, but you know more than someone coming in from the outside. So at the margin, you can tilt it your way. And that’s all you can do.” Jason Lemkin on seed concentration: “I’m doing 5%-8% of my fund into almost every deal. I have to have such a high hit rate at seed for the math to work. So it’s a “stupid” model because you have to turn away stuff with no traction, and maybe even a Datadog, but you got to just find the ones in a tight box and go all in.” Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

with Dave Vellante Dive into tech news and cutting-edge insights on current technology topics with Breaking Analysis hosted by Dave Vellante. Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and theCUBE Research communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Salesforce is moving from the hype phase of generative AI into doing the harder engineering work to create the agentic enterprise. Dreamforce 2025 showed us that the company which created the original SaaS model now wants to lead what we call service as software. In our view, this represents a profound revolution, not just in technology but in business. In a world where AI agents deliver outcomes across systems of record, systems of engagement and systems of intelligence. Our assessment is that Salesforce’s AgentForce 360 platform is crossing day one early version to attack day two problems and customer requirements. What does that mean? It’s no longer just demoing copilots inside Customer 360. Rather, the company is going after the messy problems of observability, orchestration, data quality, etc. that determine whether agent systems can scale in the enterprise. The shift to service as software will bring learning curve advantages, software- like marginal economics, and winner- take- most dynamics to all companies across every industry, not just tech vendors. We believe those firms that can more quickly jump on the AI experience curve will see substantially increased benefits relative to their competitors. However, our research suggests that data management We’re on the cusp of a new software- enabled business model that will determine winners and losers in the coming decades. We call this service -as-software. Specifically, we believe enterprises will begin to organize knowledge work in new ways, that harmonize islands of automation into a build-to-order assembly line for knowledge work. Firms that aggressively pursue this opportunity will be on a learning curve that we think will create sustainable competitive advantage, and, importantly, a winner-take-most dynamic. Now, we’re not just talking about technology vendors here. Rather, we believe new technology, operational, and business models will emerge, and apply to all enterprises across every industry. In this breaking analysis, theCUBE Research team presents a new way to think about how businesses will operate in the AI era; with implications for application developers, edge deployments, and security / governance models. With a glimpse toward the path that we think organizations can take to go from where they are today into the future. For the past several decades, Cybersecurity has been an unfair fight. The economics have favored attackers, which have access to sophisticated resources, lower costs, fast innovation cycles and deep knowledge of vulnerabilities. Defenders, by contrast, bear the full burden of securing sprawling networks, fragmented technologies, and human error, all while operating under legal, regulatory, and financial scrutiny. In our view, the Intel–NVIDIA pact further accentuates NVIDIA’s dominance and represents a final handoff of the baton in the race to the next era of computing. Just as Intel had a lock on the market in the 80s and 90s, NVIDIA has now extended its moat deep into the x86 ecosystem (in both PCs and the data center) and expanded its TAM by $500B to $1T by our estimates. The subtext here is that Lip-Bu Tan is taking necessary steps to save Intel. In doing so, he’s hitching the company’s wagon to the future, which is being defined by CUDA, NVIDIA’s software platform. This move by our estimates, increases Intel’s TAM by $100B and breathes new life into the x86 franchise, which was rapidly deteriorating. In our view, Intel foundry remains problematic but will get a boost from the system on chip (SoC) products that this partnership will produce. On balance we see this as a win for both companies, x86 customers and a further boost for AI’s momentum. CrowdStrike used Fal.con 2025 to harden its ongoing value proposition that security is a speed game. But the company extended its messaging emphasizing that platforms which orchestrate fleets of AI agents will set the bar for the future of security. In our view, George Kurtz’s keynote and theCUBE interview (below) mark a goal to create a clean hand-off from “assistive The threat landscape is undergoing a profound transformation. At CrowdStrike’s Fal.Con 2025 event in Las Vegas, Adam Meyers, who heads counter-adversary operations, provided a rare window into how the world’s most capable adversaries are adapting their tactics. His insights underscore a sobering reality in that artificial intelligence has become both a weapon and a defense shield, underscoring the asymmetry between attackers and defenders. We believe CrowdStrike (CRWD) has re-established growth momentum while still working through the financial and reputational overhang of the July 19, 2024 global outage. The company recently delivered net new ARR reacceleration ahead of expectations, showcased strong platform expansion across cloud, identity, and Next-Gen SIEM, and leaned on Falcon Flex as a durable consolidation lever. In our view, the near-term debate centers not only on churn or Flex conversion but more on net new ARR performance, valuation skepticism, and whether identity and SIEM can offset a maturing core endpoint business while fending off intensifying competition. The mainspring of CrowdStrike’s success remains relentless product innovation, increasingly defined by its platform. We believe its unified platform and AI-driven threat defense at scale underpin the company’s premium valuation through customer consolidation, stickiness, and durable ARR growth. We believe the prevailing narrative that Broadcom and NVIDIA are locked in a zero-sum battle for AI data center dominance is misleading. The reality is these companies are playing very different games. NVIDIA has built a vertically integrated compute and software platform that has become the engine of the AI factory era. Broadcom, by contrast, has constructed a durable business model around connectivity, custom silicon, and high-margin software. The strategies overlap but are not mutually exclusive. We believe the real story is how these firms are carving out complementary positions in the most important technology cycle since the dawn of the Internet. We believe the industry’s broad interpretation of Jensen’s Law — i.e. “Jensen’s Law accelerates Moore’s Law” — understates a fundamental economic reality of AI Factories. Jensen Huang’s own language and NVIDIA’s operating model point to a financial law of motion for AI factories: When power is the binding constraint and demand is elastic, perf/watt increases raise monetizable throughput faster than they raise total cost. The result is an extension to existing laws of tech that we’ve come to know. Specifically, Jensen’s invoking of Buy ore to make more (i.e. revenue up) and spend more to save more (i.e. unit cost down) has explicit economic implications that we believe need further examination. In addition, there is a corollary in this new regime in that, under certain conditions, fabric‑driven utilization unlocks are so valuable that high‑speed networking becomes “economically free” (i.e. where utilization gains exceed amortized fabric cost). In this Breaking Analysis we explain in detail what we’re referring to as a new Jensen’s Law. We’ll explore why this phenomenon is so important, review the math behind it, share some concrete examples of where the law is applicable, when the corollary of “the network is free” holds, implications for investors and operators; and where the law is not applicable. We believe the center of gravity in AI infrastructure has shifted from servers to AI factories, where networking is perhaps as critical as compute. Our analysis of an interview with NVIDIA SVP of Networking, Gilad Shainer, indicates NVIDIA’s thesis is straightforward. Specifically, that scale-up fabrics (NVLink/NVLink Fusion) plus scale-out Ethernet purpose-built for AI (Spectrum-X) — and increasingly scale-across for multi–data center topologies (Spectrum-XGS) — deliver superior determinism, efficiency, and time-to-outcomes at giga-scale. At the same time, the market is too large and heterogeneous for any single fabric to dominate; open standards and merchant Ethernet will continue to win broad adoption, and even NVIDIA is embracing open interfaces and ecosystems to complement its proprietary advantages. In our view, NVIDIA is a somewhat rare case where first-mover advantage has paid off. Its early conviction in parallel computing, GPUs, CUDA/NCCL software moats, and the Mellanox acquisition now underpin a defensible systems position across scale-up, scale-out, and (increasingly) scale-across. Cybersecurity is the number one risk facing enterprises today, and yet organizations remain dangerously unprepared. Executives are not blind to the problem — they understand the financial exposure, the reputational stakes, and the business impact of a major breach. They acknowledge gaps in their defenses and recognize the vulnerabilities that could cripple their mission-critical systems. But awareness has not translated into readiness and true business resilience remains elusive for the vast majority of firms. Data strategies are especially important – specifically data governance, data protection, and data quality. These remain essential elements of cyber resilience, but they’re only part of the equation. True business resilience requires confronting a multitude of dimensions — from application security to identity, supply chain integrity, operational continuity, infrastructure defenses and more. The uncomfortable truth is that most firms still lack the cohesive strategy, investment, and execution to protect their most vital assets. Donald Trump’s 180 on Intel is at least directionally correct, certainly more so than calling for the ouster of Lip-Bu Tan, Intel’s CEO. But a contemplated investment by the US in Intel, as reported by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, without a significant restructuring of Intel’s entire business, is a recipe for failure in our view. Specifically, we continue to urge Intel’s board to spin out its foundry business. Every day it waits further decreases foundry’s value. Moreover, we call on the U.S. government to use money from the CHIPS Act and its influence on large US chip designers, and TSMC, to secure a position for a US-domiciled company in advanced semiconductor manufacturing. AI is currently running on a one lane, CapEx highway that is capacity constrained. Hyperscalers are the largest contributor to the momentum and as such, investors keep score with cloud growth rates. But this past quarter you had to read the footnotes and the fine print to go beyond the massive investments fueling the wave. Microsoft put up eye-popping Azure growth again, but a big part of that acceleration is Azure serving AI inference — notably ChatGPT — now neatly included in the revised definition of what’s included in Azure. This is great for headlines but not conducive to apples-to-apples comparisons over time. Meanwhile, AWS delivered the largest revenue for cloud infrastructure and sent a clear message that demand exceeds supply. Meaning growth is capped by power and components, not pipeline. That creates a weird optics penalty — AWS showing growth in the high teens on a $120B-plus run rate and it’s deemed “concerning.” But it also telegraphs future upside as capacity goes online and depreciation cycles progress. OpenAI and NVIDIA just dropped news with implications for every model lab, cloud, and enterprise AI customer and vendor. The two companies released gpt-oss-20B and gpt-oss-120B, open-weight reasoning models trained on H100, tuned across NVIDIA’s full stack, and capable of spitting out 1.5 million tokens per second on a single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack. The weights ship under a permissive license; the inference path spans DGX Cloud, Blackwell servers, and RTX PCs via Ollama, llama.cpp, vLLM, FlashInfer, Hugging Face, and Microsoft AI Foundry Local. Last November, we argued that Jamie Dimon is sitting on a treasure trove of proprietary data that will never find its way into proprietary LLMs via the Internet. And as such, he was Sam Altman’s biggest competitor because his data is more valuable than the democratized insights from these LLMs. Our premise was and continues to be that foundation model companies are waging an internecine battle chasing artificial general intelligence (Messiah AGI) and the true holy grail is what we called “enterprise AGI;” meaning applying AI to proprietary data inside of enterprises will ultimately prove to be the most valuable endeavor. Today we extend that argument and posit that agents and enterprise digital twins, powered by that proprietary data, will drive the next wave of AI value. By all accounts, Microsoft just delivered one of the most powerful quarters in its history. But this wasn’t just a blowout print, it was a signal that Microsoft is playing a new game. The company’s performance is redefining what hyperscale looks like in the AI era. An objective analysis of the Q4 FY2025 earnings call suggests that Microsoft is firing on all cylinders in cloud, AI, and infrastructure execution, and it’s building for a future measured in gigawatts, not racks. The only potential negatives for investors are: 1) Capital expenditures are expected to be more than $30B in the coming quarter, signalling continued spending ahead of revenue and negatively affecting cash flow; and 2) Gross margin pressure continues in cloud due to the lower margins realized in its Azure / infrastructure business. The stablecoin market is rapidly maturing into one of the most consequential sectors of the digital asset econoour. After years of uncertainty, regulatory friction, and media skepticism, stablecoins are no longer a speculative curiosity, rather they are foundational to the next chapter of programmable finance. Our research suggests that the convergence of policy shifts, institutional adoption, and new economic use cases has thrust stablecoins into the spotlight. In short: crypto’s ChatGPT moment has arrived, and its name is stablecoin. In our view, IBM delivered one of its strongest quarters in recent memory, reinforcing a narrative we’ve tracked for some time – i.e. the pivot from legacy to a modern, AI-driven hybrid cloud company is finally showing up in the numbers. The company beat expectations across revenue, profit, margin, and free cash flow, and perhaps more importantly, demonstrated credible traction While the NASDAQ seems to reach new highs daily, enterprise tech spending remains persistently cautious at the macro amid continued uncertainty. That’s not necessarily bad news but it can be disconcerting to decision makers. Often during transitional cycles, like the one we’re in now, executives don’t want to overrotate on capital allocations that deliver outcomes, which could potentially be achieved much more cost effectively with emerging technologies like AI. We’ve seen similar patterns in previous waves. There was a period of “great softness” in enterprise IT spending when transitioning from mainframes and minis to the PC era, a huge backlash from overly exuberant Y2K and dotcom spending; and a steady deterioration of traditional enterprise tech momentum during the cloud, mobile, SaaS, social, big data era. Each wave is different but two common themes remain: 1/ strong conviction that a new era is here; and 2/ fear of disruption, which sometimes leads to hasty decision making and waste. These countervailing forces seem to be in play today as 87% of enterprises report taking a cautious approach to AI investments. And that caution is showing up in the macro spend environment. Intel’s new CEO has promised to clean up the balance sheet, slim down the company, return to a culture of engineering, sharpen its customer focus, shore up its products, become a world class independent foundry and lead Intel for as long as it takes to achieve success, however that is defined. As our audience knows, unlike most other analysts, we have aggressively emphasized the icebergs ahead for Intel since 2013, culminating in our prediction that Intel would go bankrupt trying to execute on its most previous strategy. While we would have preferred a different approach to Intel’s foundry – i.e. JV with TSM – Lip-Bu Tan at least has what we consider to be a viable go forward plan. The steady state outcome of this new direction, however is far from certain. In last week’s Breaking Analysis we argued that Snowflake was attempting to cross the Rubicon, vaulting from cloud data warehouse innovator into AI leader and intelligent application platform. This week the competitive fire got a fresh accelerant. As usual, Databricks followed up Snowflake Summit and put forth bold claims of its own, emphasizing unified governance, data intelligence, simplified user experiences, transactional capabilities and, of course, open data. Cisco hasn’t enjoyed much organic revenue growth in more than a decade. It just rolled into San Diego claiming this year’s Cisco Live is the “most consequential” event in the company’s history. Hyperbole? Maybe. But after three days on-site comprising Q&A with Chuck Robbins and Jeetu Patel, closed-door roadmap dives, and a flood of product reveals in public, our assessment is that Cisco finally has a credible, end-to-end story for the AI era. Our research indicates that data platform wars have entered an entirely new phase, one where open data is no longer a marketing slogan and governance catalogs are now the new control point. We see this as the first of several structural changes to the software industry. The next price of entry we think will be an emerging layer that we call systems of intelligence, or SOI, which we believe will become a high value piece of real estate in the AI-optimized software stack. In this Breaking Analysis, and just a few days removed from Snowflake Summit 2025, we unpack how Snowflake has moved from steward of its pristine proprietary data platform to orchestrating an ecosystem in a world that enables any compute engine to operate on any open data formats. Last week, we framed the company’s Rubicon moment, meaning the pivot from analytic warehouse to enabler of intelligent data apps. The data industry has arrived at a pivotal juncture that echoes the themes we’ve charted in previous Breaking Analysis episodes, from The Sixth Data Platform through The Yellow Brick Road to Agentic AI; Why Jamie Dimon is Sam Altman’s Biggest Competitor all the way to the Faceoff between Benioff and Nadella. Those analyses have chronicled the steady convergence of analytic data platforms such as Snowflake and Databricks, not only with the hyperscalers’ estates, but increasingly, with the operational applications that run businesses. Our research indicates that this merger is not a side-effect of Gen AI hype, rather it’s a structural shift in how enterprises will create value from data and software over the next several decades. Thirty months into the GenAI awakening, the jury is still out on how much enterprises are benefiting from investments in artificial intelligence. While the vast majority of customers continue to spend on AI, reported returns are no greater than, and frankly lag those, typically associated with historical IT initiatives like ERP, data warehousing and cloud computing. Let’s face it, the multi-hundred billion dollar annual CAPEX outlay from hyperscalers and sovereign nations is fueling the euphoria and essentially supporting blind faith in the AI movement. But ground truth returns from enterprise AI adoption remain opaque. This combined with geopolitical unrest, fluctuating public policy and GDP estimates in the low single digits, have buyers tempering expectations for tech spending relative to January of this year. Dell’s founder-led business is one of the most remarkable and under appreciated stories in tech. Dell Technologies is not particularly sexy, nor does it put forth an earth- shattering vision that bends the mind. Yet it’s a company that has consistently figured out how to ride successive waves without becoming driftwood. And like Hyman Roth of Godfather fame, Michael Dell always seems to make money for his partners. Unlike Roth, Mr. Dell is not a gangster, rather he’s a gentleman that literally wrote the book on how to play nice and win. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of DTW 2025, we examine the question, how will Dell capture the explosive AI opportunity, while transitioning the millions of servers, arrays, and PCs it already has in the field to this new AI era? The Road to ‘Service-as-Software.’ Salesforce co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff is articulating a bold vision for the next era of enterprise software. In an exclusive interview with theCUBE on April 25, 2025, Benioff outlined how AI-driven agents and a unified data architecture will transform Software as a Service (SaaS) into what we’re calling “Service as Software” – a model where software-based digital agents augment every business process. The Salesforce chief has often quipped that today’s CEOs are “the last generation of executives leading exclusively human workforces,” underscoring his conviction that AI agents (what many call agentic AI) will soon work alongside humans in every enterprise. Our premise is that this “digital labor” revolution could be more disruptive than the cloud and mobile waves of 15 years ago, fundamentally redefining how applications function. Our view is that IBM has crystallized a coherent, differentiated AI thesis based on smaller, domain‑tuned models running on an open, hybrid‑cloud fabric. The goal is to unlock what it claims is the 99 percent of enterprise data still untouched by GenAI. If execution matches the marketing—particularly on integration speed and cost transparency—IBM will change the perception from perennial AI underdog to a primary or even default choice for risk‑averse enterprises seeking tangible ROI. The next two quarters of Watsonx bookings and Granite adoption will tell us whether the strategy is hitting escape velocity, merely clearing the launchpad or needs a reset. Based on this quarter’s earnings reports, it’s clear to us that demand is not the constraint for hyperscale clouds. They are, however running head‑long into the hard limits of physics. Access to megawatts, liquid‑cooled racks, and a GPU supply chain that begins and ends with NVIDIA are now critical paths to tapping what appears to be unlimited demand. AWS, Microsoft, and Google each chalked up record‑setting capital outlays last quarter—collectively dropping around $63 billion in CAPEX—yet even that eye‑popping sum can’t fully satiate the compute‑hungry AI models racing toward trillion‑parameter scale. We believe the real story isn’t simply “AI is expensive”; it’s that power availability, not revenue potential, is now the gating factor on hyperscaler growth. In our view, the winners of the next cycle will be the providers that secure sustainable energy footprints, master GPU allocation, and—critically—translate all that infrastructure into margin‑accretive AI services before the depreciation schedules kick in. Welcome to the ironic era where megawatts equal market share. As RSAC 2025 approaches, key themes are emerging that are set to dominate the world’s largest cybersecurity gathering. Industry dynamics are shifting rapidly – from AI enabling higher velocity threats, an intensified platform consolidation debate, high-profile M&A, rising interest in AI agents (with somewhat tepid adoption in cyber) and shifting security budget priorities. Our research shows that while cybersecurity remains At last week’s AI Agent Builder Summit, hosted by Scott Hebner of theCUBE Research at SiliconANGLE’s Palo Alto Studios, the hype around “agentic AI” – autonomous software agents that can orchestrate complex tasks – was on full display. Demos and keynotes painted a bold vision of AI-driven business processes. But scratch beneath the surface, and a sobering reality emerges: Most enterprises are far from ready to reap the benefits of fully autonomous agents. Much work needs to be done to realize the promise of agentic systems, including organizational alignment to create a true data culture, cleaning up data silos, harmonizing that data, data ownership, data product thinking, getting governance and security right, choosing technology partners, rationalizing your SaaS and on-prem applications portfolio, and of course change management to get all this done. Starting the journey toward an agentic enterprise is an exciting imperative, but in our view will take the better part of a decade to realize. We estimate that Google’s Cloud business will exceed $50B in annual revenue this year with Google Cloud Platform comprising more than 50% of its cloud revenue for the first time ever. Why is it then that Google’s cloud business, a $50B+ entity growing deep into the double digits gets so much criticism? The answer is simple. Google’s cloud, with arguably the best technology in the industry, is 2.5 – 3.5 times smaller than the cloud businesses of AWS and Microsoft. We are in the midst of a fundamental transformation of computing architectures. We’re moving from a world where we create data, store it, retrieve it, harmonize it and present it so that we can make better decisions, to a world that creates content from knowledge using tokens as a new unit of value; and increasingly takes action in real time with or without human intervention, driving unprecedented increases in value. What this means is every part of the computing stack, from silicon, infrastructure, security, middleware, development tools, applications and even services, is changing. As with other waves in computing, consumer adoption leads us up the innovation curve where the value is clear, the volume is high and the velocity is accelerated, leading to lower costs and eventual adoption into and disruption of enterprise applications. Importantly, to do this work on today’s data center infrastructure would be 10X more expensive, trending toward 100X by the end of the decade. As such, virtually everything is going to move to this new model of computing. Automation generally and AI specifically, render today’s cybersecurity stacks ineffective. Previously, stopping 99% of attacks and leaving the 1% for armed human hunters to deal with was, while not ideal, at least feasible. With AI, that all goes away because adversaries can scale phishing and other attacks at unprecedented rates, which overwhelms the ability of humans. This creates a wider gap between exfiltration times, which are shrinking, and mean time to remediation, giving even greater advantage to attackers. As such, the only way to fight AI is with AI. Moreover, the ever expanding number of tools in an organization’s security stack continues to exacerbate the problem. According to Palo Alto Networks, the answer is a complete makeover of your cybersecurity stack where consolidating multiple tools into a single platform and gaining comprehensive access to the right data, simplifies security operations and enables AI to operate in real time. The analyst relations (AR) function is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Once dominated by a handful of large research houses, such as Gartner, IDC and Forrester, the market now features a spectrum of independent analysts and influencers. The fast-paced nature of the tech industry, its speed of change, the relentless competition and ubiquity of technology, make it a challenging sector for Since the Gen AI awakening, we’ve said consistently that NVIDIA and Broadcom are the #1 and #2 AI plays in tech. Since peaking in mid-December of last year, Broadcom shares have been under pressure, off on sympathy with other semiconductor stocks and the general confusion about the economy, tariffs, inflation, jobs, geopolitics, debt, etc. Broadcom’s Q1 results were impressive and assuaged some of these fears. At one point last night after hours the stock was up 15% from its previous close and midday Friday was up around 6-7% despite continued pressure on tech shares. Market transitions such as the one we’re in now often bring confusion and market volatility as the new high growth sectors are not large enough to offset the slowdown in the larger declining markets. NVIDIA doesn’t have this problem because it is at the mainspring of the new wave. Broadcom is facing a similar but different dynamic in that its traditional businesses are ones that are extremely durable. Moreover, we see two relatively new dynamics coming into play for Broadcom: 1) Hyperscalers are coming to Broadcom to enable their custom AI accelerators; and 2) Broadcom’s VMware strategy is working, lifting the company to new software heights. A seismic shift is underway in enterprise software, one that pits two of the most influential leaders in the industry—Microsoft’s Satya Nadella and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff—against each other in a war of words that highlights the broader transformation unfolding in enterprise applications. Nadella predicts the demise of traditional SaaS applications, arguing that AI-powered agents will take over, fundamentally redefining enterprise software. Benioff, on the other hand, argues that AI will serve as an augmentation layer and rely on his existing platform to supply the digital workforce of the future. Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing—an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind TSMC, which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core CPU design business—a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine—remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Rumors swirl that Broadcom might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security, and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. Earnings reports from the big three cloud players disappointed investors this week. All three US hyperscalers fell a bit short of consensus for their cloud revenues in the December quarter and investor reaction has been negative. But squinting through the data, there’s a lot to like about the position of AWS, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In particular, the IaaS and PaaS revenue alone for the big 3 approached $200B in 2024 and grew 25%. All three cited capacity constraints and, along with Meta, are committing more than $300B in CAPEX spend this year, most of it to support current and future AI demand. As is often the case, when a new wave hits it tends to be overhyped at the beginning of the cycle and underestimated when it hits a steady state. And in between points A and B we often see blips and bumps that represent opportunities for long term investors. Make no mistake. We are entering a technology cycle that is completely new. Massively parallel computing and the Gen AI awakening is creating an entirely different industry focus that has altered customer spending patterns. Moreover, this new computing paradigm has changed competitive dynamics almost overnight. Decisions whether to spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions on CAPEX are being challenged by novel approaches to deploying AI. Geopolitical tensions are higher than at any time in the history of tech. While the pace of change appears to be accelerating, causing consternation and confusion, the reality is that broad technology adoption evolves over long periods of time, creating opportunities, risks, and tectonic shifts in industry structures. At the beginning of each year, as is our tradition, we collaborate with ETR to dig through the latest data and craft ten predictions for the coming year. This year’s batch follows some annual favorites and some new territory. In this Breaking Analysis we put forth our top ten predictions for enterprise tech in 2025 with our usual data-heavy opinions and prognostications. In just two short years, the entire data and technology industry has undergone a seismic shift. Tech stacks—from top to bottom—are being tuned to harness extreme parallel computing, often called Accelerated Computing. From silicon to infrastructure and throughout the software layer, nowhere is this transformation more pronounced than in the data stack. Over the past seven years, modern cloud-native data platforms set the agenda. Today, however, the rise of open table formats, shifting control points, open-source governance catalogs, and a heightened focus on AI are creating both challenges and opportunities for enterprises and the tech providers who serve them. In this special breaking analysis, we’re pleased to host our fourth annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in the Cube Collective and members of the Data Gang. With us today are five of the top industry analysts focused on data platforms. Sanjeev Mohan of Sanjmo, Tony Bear of DB Insight, recent IDC graduate Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger of ISG and Brad Schimmin with Omdia. We are witnessing the rise of a completely new computing era. Within the next decade, a trillion-dollar-plus data center business is poised for transformation, powered by what we refer to as extreme parallel computing (EPC)—or as some prefer to call it, accelerated computing. While artificial intelligence is the primary accelerant, the effects ripple across the entire technology stack. Nvidia sits in the vanguard of this shift, forging an end-to-end platform that integrates hardware, software, systems engineering, and a massive ecosystem. Our view is that Nvidia has a 10-to-20-year runway to drive this transformation, but the market forces at play are much larger than a single player. This new paradigm is about reimagining compute from the ground up: from the chip level to data center equipment, to distributed computing at scale, data and applications stacks and emerging robotics at the edge. The road to agentic AI will be paved with stepping stones that progressively build on each other. Our research suggests that Agentic AI will not suddenly appear without a strong data foundation built on: 1) cloud-like scalability; 2) a unified metadata model; 3) data mesh organizing principles; 4) harmonized data and business process logic; and an orchestration framework that incorporates governance, security and observability. The time for Intel to shed its foundry business is now. While former CEO Pat Gelsinger made a persuasive case for U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturing, his vision was flawed from the start. Intel’s foundry operation, like IBM’s Microelectronics business a decade ago, is an asset with negative value. Yet, its strategic significance for U.S. competitiveness in the semiconductor race cannot be overstated. If financial institutions are deemed too big to fail, then Intel’s foundry represents a similarly critical infrastructure for U.S. national interests. AWS re:Invent 2024 ushered in a transformative chapter for both Amazon Web Services and the broader tech ecosystem. This year’s event marked the debut of Matt Garman as CEO of AWS, stepping into a role that aligns with what John Furrier aptly describes as a “wartime CEO”—a technically adept leader and trusted consigliere. Garman’s keynote set the tone for AWS’s strategic focus: doubling down on core infrastructure capabilities across silicon, compute, storage, and networking, while extending its Graviton playbook to GPUs and potentially large language models (LLMs). The inboxes are overflowing once again with predictions about the future of enterprise tech, as we gear up for 2025. While many of these forecasts are insightful, we’ll sift through them carefully before releasing our own predictions later in January of next year. True to tradition, we aim to set a higher bar for our forecasts by focusing on measurable outcomes—whether it’s tied to a specific number or a clear binary result. Our philosophy remains consistent: a good prediction should be testable, enabling us to look back a year later and determine, with confidence and supporting data, whether it held true. In this Breaking Analysis, we evaluate the 2024 predictions we made alongside ETR’s Erik Bradley. We revisit our January forecasts on topics like the macro IT spending environment, GenAI ROI, security, on-prem AI, technology priorities and more. The ever expanding cloud has become ubiquitous. No longer is the cloud some remote set of services, somewhere up in the sky. Rather, the cloud is seeping into every industry, hybrid on-prem models, edge workloads, telco markets and has its sights on space. The market size is staggering and will surpass $1T in revenue when including infrastructure – IaaS and PaaS – SaaS and professional services. Much AI work is being done today in the public cloud and despite indications that bringing AI to on-prem data will be a growing trend, it’s unlikely that the cloud will stop expanding any time soon. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware is proceeding almost exactly as we expected when the deal was announced in May of 2022. While much of the media and competitor narrative is focused on the increased license fees Broadcom is imposing and the urgency of migrating off VMware, customer conversations and recent surveys show that while migrations are happening, the real story is that VMware’s more narrow focus and cost discipline are allowing Broadcom to integrate VMWare into its highly successful business model. Specifically, we see two seemingly countervailing trends that are both possible to be true: 1) Customers are actively moving many low value workloads off VMware; and 2) Most mission critical work is staying put, allowing Broadcom to dramatically increase the contribution from its software business and deliver a roadmap for customers that will be more cost effective than migrating. Investors have poured north of $30B into independent foundation model players including OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Mistral and others. OpenAI itself has raised more than $20B. To keep pace, both Meta and xAI will have to spend comparable amounts. In our view, the stampeding herd of LLM investors is blindly focused on the false grail of so-called artificial general intelligence AGI. We believe the greatest value capture exists in what we’re calling enterprise AGI, metaphorically represented by the proprietary data estates and managerial know-how locked inside of firms like JP Morgan Chase, and virtually every enterprise. The tools to curate and harness that collective intelligence will allow these firms to capture the majority of value in the race for AI leadership. Gen AI enthusiasm has lately turned to AI skepticism. Lack of clarity on tangible ROI for mainstream businesses, a narrow list of early winners and relentless vendor marketing around AI has caused cynicism and media backlash. But the reality remains that we have entered a new era in technology innovation that has a high probability of transforming industries, public policy, company leadership and the related fortunes of individuals and organizations. Moreover, 97% of leading Gen AI adopters report that they’re achieving tangible benefits from their deployments. Adoption of Gen AI is relentlessly on the rise and nearly two years in, is poised to begin throwing off enough value that it will heighten a mandate to apply AI to drive business results. As such, we believe that as we exit Q4 into 2025, the demand for AI solutions will continue to occupy the headspace of business technology pros and AI momentum will maintain its accelerated pace. It’s estimated that organizations spend more than $200B annually on security hardware, software and services globally. That’s a big number. But consider that the economic impact of cybercrime ranges from $500B – $2T annually. There’s even an estimate from cybersecurity ventures that says the figure is as high as $9.5T. Each year, it seems the more we spend, the more vulnerable we become, which is especially concerning given the exposure to critical infrastructures. Governments around the world have stepped up their involvement with executive orders, privacy regulations and lots of “finger wagging” at the technology industry and its customers. Frankly some of that is justified. The technology industry does much good but has a subpar record at solving this problem. One premise that we’ve put forth at theCUBE Research is that the industry must find ways to better collaborate and share resources to combat cyber threats. Two firms, IBM and Palo Alto Networks, have joined forces to combine deep expertise, AI and platform approach to better protect organizations from attackers. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the security landscape and unpack the multi-dimensional relationship between IBM and Palo Alto Networks to better understand how industry collaboration can improve cyber defenses and modernize security operations. With us are two senior executives from each firm, Mohamad Ali, SVP and Head of IBM Consulting and BJ Jenkins, the President of Palo Alto Networks. Microsoft’s new financial disclosures include changes to the way it reports Azure metrics. The company said the change was to better align Azure with consumption revenue and by inference, more closely aligning with how AWS, the leader in cloud computing infrastructure, reports its metrics. The accounting change removed certain mature, slower growth revenue streams and consequently raised the growth rates for Azure. It also had the effect of increasing the AI services contribution within Azure. While this was reported and often applauded in the media and financial circles, what wasn’t widely discussed is that while such a change increases growth rates, by definition it reduces the size of the Azure business and its resulting revenue market share. Regardless, in our view, Microsoft is comfortable that the future AI revenue contribution within Azure combined with both higher growth rates and a greater AI contribution will foster greater investor confidence and enthusiasm over time. They’re probably correct. Data from recent surveys shows that the scenarios we’ve been putting forth throughout 2024 continue to be in play. Specifically, we cite three main dynamics affecting the tech spending climate, including: 1) IT budgets continue to be constrained as; 2) GenAI is being funded by stealing from other budget buckets; and 3) The ROI for AI initiatives remains tepid, as expectations for break even continue to be pushed out to the right. Nonetheless, customers remain highly optimistic about the prospects for AI driving productivity improvements. Moreover, the cloud remains a key ingredient in supporting AI workloads. We believe the AI center of gravity for enterprise value creation is shifting from LLMs to SLMs. Where the S not only stands for small but encompasses a system of small, specialized, secure and sovereign models. Moreover, we see LLMs and SLMs evolving to become agentic, hence SAM – i.e. small action models. In our view, it’s the collection of these “S-models,” combined with an emerging data harmonization layer, that will enable systems of agents to work in concert and create high impact business outcomes. These multi-agent systems will completely reshape the software industry generally and more specifically, unleash a new productivity paradigm for organizations globally. Technology generally and big tech specifically are regularly cited by politicians, media and governments around the world as the root of many societal problems today. Accusations like privacy invaders, fake news amplifiers, job destroyers, discriminators and more are commonly lobbed at technology firms with little recognition for the substantial value large tech companies have delivered over the decades. Moreover, many powerful government officials have rewritten the history of effective government oversight and are attempting to apply antitrust law in novel ways that have virtually killed M&A and threaten to stifle American exceptionalism and innovation. For over a decade we’ve been sounding the alarm on Intel. Five years ago, like some on Wall Street, we recommended a strategy to recreate Intel by splitting up its design and manufacturing divisions. Most recently we posited that a miracle would be needed for Intel to achieve its aspirations of becoming a viable number two foundry by 2030. The majority of industry pundits have finally come to the realization that Intel’s current path is unsustainable. However some still feel that splitting Intel’s fabs from its design business doesn’t make sense. We disagree. Oracle Corporation is seeing renewed business momentum powered by a combination of an entrenched database business, years of investment in cloud infrastructure, an integrated application suite and AI technologies that are being infused throughout its product line. This includes its autonomous database, 23ai, Exadata/Exascale, other Oracle infrastructure and its vast applications portfolio. Oracle has a highly differentiated strategy that is hitting on most if not all cylinders. And it appears the best is yet to come. It’s one reason that, year to date, the stock is up 54%, compared to the Nasdaq which is up 19% as of the recording of this recording. Input from theCUBE and data practitioner communities suggests that acceleration in compute performance and the sophistication of the modern data stack (MDS) is outpacing the needs of many traditional analytic workloads. Most analytics workloads today are performed on small data sets and generally can run on a single node, somewhat neutralizing the value of distributed, highly scalable data platforms. As We believe enterprise applications are undergoing a profound change. By next year, highly capable agentic systems will emerge to create new application classes and alter the way organizations think about their backend systems, data platforms and user interfaces. The extent of the transformation, we believe, will be more impactful to the application stack than were the changes brought about by innovations seen during the modern GUI, Web, cloud and mobile eras. Customers and partners are pivoting to address Broadcom’s swift changes to its VMware packaging, pricing and partnership programs. Our data suggests customers and MSPs have moved beyond the emotional shock phase to implementing their options in earnest. Our advice to large VMware customers has been to evaluate your ELA expiration and work backwards from that timeframe. Isolate core workloads that The investor community is realizing that the return on invested capital for the AI buildout is going to take some time. The payback period for enterprise AI investments is not akin to the dopamine rush from completing a great workout. This realization combined with several other macro factors, has caused the big AI names to pullback hard recently. But the The so-called modern data stack is getting a facelift and perhaps a complete body makeover. As the point of control shifts from the DBMS to the governance layer we cite three dynamics that highlight a reshaping of today’s data landscape, including: 1) Key data players are disrupting the established norm as they expand their aspirations; 2) Data platform vendors used Three main pressure points are transforming the modern data landscape: 1) Increased interest in adopting open table formats to allow any compute to operate on any data; 2) The point of control is shifting from the DBMS to the governance layer; and 3) AI is enabling the emergence of a new class of intelligent data apps that promise to radically automate business processes and drive unprecedented levels of productivity. The chaos caused by yesterday’s CrowdStrike content update shows that even the most successful cybersecurity firms with great management, award-winning products and a growing business, are exposed to unexpected events. What’s even more important is that it underscores the fragility of our connected world and the critical infrastructure that makes it run. Virtually every industry, and who knows how many AI continues to lead all enterprise IT sectors by a wide margin in terms of spending momentum. But that momentum has not led to an across the board boost in productivity or meaningful revenue gains for firms. Specifically, the adoption of Gen AI is increasing steadily but the use cases are not yet self-funding. As such, the outlook for IT spending, while slowly improving in the second half of 2024, remains constrained. In this Breaking Analysis we share our thoughts on the emerging trends around agentic AI. We’ll define what it is, how agentic builds on (and is additive to) generative AI, what’s missing to make it real, what the stack components look like and some of the likely players in the space. As customers try to “get AI right,” the need to rationalize siloed data becomes increasingly important. Data practitioners could put all their data eggs into a single platform basket, but that’s proving impractical. As such, firms are moving to an open model where they maintain control of their data and can bring any compute engine to any of their data. While compelling, the capabilities to govern open data across an entire estate remain immature. Regardless, the move toward open table formats is gaining traction and the point of control in the data platform wars is shifting from the database to the governance catalog. Earnings prints from the likes of Dell, Supermicro and more recently HPE have shown the AI server trend is not just benefiting cloud hyperscalers but also firms with large on-premises installed bases. Oracle as well is trading at an all time high citing cloud momentum and recent deals with Google, OpenAI and prior deals with Microsoft. But make no mistake, Snowflake Summit 2024 marks the next chapter in the company’s history with new CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy taking center stage, driving even faster product innovation and an ambitious TAM expansion strategy. Snowflake has moved beyond being a friendly and simpler data warehouse to tackling new problems including how to bring AI value to enterprise customers, helping ecosystem partners monetize and providing tools and services to build AI-powered enterprise data apps. Snowflake is at a crossroads. The company, which defined the modern data platform, now faces fresh challenges on four fronts. Specifically, Snowflake must: 1) advance its data cloud vision; 2) transform into an AI leader; 3) become a platform for data apps; and 4) address external market forces that pressure its core values of simplicity, efficiency, and trusted data. In this research we quantify the semiconductor ecosystem which we believe is being led by a transition to AI. Four companies stand out including NVIDIA, TSMC, Broadcom and Qualcomm to make up 45% of a $900B market by 2028. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, ahead of IBM Think and Dell Technologies World, we shine a spotlight on these two firms as leading examples of hybrid AI players that we believe will benefit from the AI wave that is upon us. And of course we’ll share several survey data points from ETR to support our assertions. RSAC 2024 was crowded, buzzy, vibrant and chaotic, underscoring the very nature of the cybersecurity industry. This market has a kind of self-propelling energy with a dynamic that blends tons of money, an ever-present and capable adversary, technical innovation, public policy, geopolitics, and a smashing together of the digital and physical worlds. In this Breaking Analysis we introduce you to Blue Yonder, a builder of digital supply chain management solutions that we believe represents an emerging example of intelligent data applications. Organizations continue to spend more on security with 87% of firms expecting to increase spend on cyber in the next twelve months. But are we safer? It’s estimated that firms on average have between 60-75 security tools installed. While leading vendors logically market the benefits of addressing tools sprawl and complexity through consolidation, the data suggests that more than half the firms are increasing the number of security vendors installed with a very small percentage able to affect vendor consolidation. In another big week we saw the AI battles continue to escalate. Google reorged to better focus on AI, Meta’s Llama 3 was released, TSM is doubling its manufacturing capacity for NVIDIA high end chips, Samsung got a $6.4B tranche of the chips act money, a Microsoft paper describes VASA-1 that turns photos into a kinda creepy talking head, Mistral Enterprises are fighting a dual mandate of operating inside a tight IT budget envelope while at the same time transforming their organization into an AI-first company. Navigating macroeconomic headwinds while driving innovation is an exciting challenge for IT decision makers. To deliver the goods, technology leaders are stealing from other budgets to fund AI, finding quick wins with fairly unspectacular AWS’ AI strategy combines foundation model optionality from partners with its own innovations across a three layered AI stack. In this Breaking Analysis we review takeaways from our AI field trip to NYC. Adobe Summit 2024 put highlighted AI powered digital experiences and personalization at scale. By applying AI, Adobe showed off its ability to bring custom experiences to the masses and do so with trusted, enterprise-grade content. Adobe’s TAM is approaching $300B and the company is demonstrating the ability to monetize AI at scale. We attended both NVIDIA GTC and Broadcom’s investor day this week where the AI platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. When you think of AI leadership, which companies come to mind? NVIDIA, OpenAI, the hyperscalers, Meta, Hugging Face, Anthropic and names like that, right? You don’t typically think of Broadcom do you? You should. Many people question whether the current AI boom will end in the same way that the dotcom bubble burst. It’s understandable as there are many similarities, especially with the exuberance seen this past week in the stock market following NVIDIA’s earnings print. The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, i.e. a capability that allows a globally consistent, real time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and non-relational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. Predictions become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true– ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Recent spending intentions data from more than 1,700 IT decision makers indicates that executives expect technology budgets to grow at 4.3% this year. That’s up from roughly 3.5% in 2023 and is higher than the expectation in October which was 3.8%. But the forecasts for 2024 are backend loaded. Moreover, while some sectors such as energy and regions like APAC With George Gilbert We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with With Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer, Carl Olofson, Dave Menninger and Doug Henschen In the words of famous people like Nobel laureate Neils Bohr and baseball legend Yogi Berra, predictions are very difficult, especially if they’re about the future. In this special Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to host our third annual data predictions power panel with some of our collaborators in Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them The rapid awareness and adoption of AI has increased concerns around security, governance, compliance and business risk. The digital business imperative to improve customer experience combined with a vastly more complex technology environment, comprising multiple clouds, IoT, containers, app integration and the popularity of open source, are driving need for better observability across technology stacks. But fragmented IT environments, lack Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, With George Gilbert We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s With George Gilbert Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to Episode 207 Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by Cisco’s $28B acquisition of Splunk represents a good outcome for Splunk and a strategic growth opportunity for Cisco. Splunk’s painful transition to a cloud and subscription pricing model was largely through the knot hole as seen by its margins and recent P&L performance. But questions remained with respect to its growth prospects and competitiveness in the hot observability space.

For With George Gilbert The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, realtime system. The premise is that increasingly, George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this With George Gilbert and Rob Strechay At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. With George Gilbert Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent With Rob Strechay and Zeus Kerravala The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting.

Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates.

Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration With George Gilbert, Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, With George Gilbert Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data With Rob Strechay & Andy Thurai HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with With George Gilbert Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created.

We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of AI raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing.

Once hopeful that the security industry would be shielded from macroeconomic conditions, the past year has been painful for many investors with some exceptions – most notably those investors who stuck with Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet. That On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll An AI-powered rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over The financial services industry has always been a leading consumer of tech with big IT budgets. The recent banking crisis will add even more headwinds to the already challenging IT spending climate and several tech firms are exposed. In particular, we believe those companies with a higher than average mix of business in financial sectors, combined with decelerating spend momentum The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms.

But creating Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2021 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, With Andy Thurai, VP & Principal Analyst, Constellation Research A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data.

Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0.

The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm.

We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger The rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Today we’ll address the following frequently asked questions: 1. In an industry full of hype and buzzwords, why After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. But judging by the attendance and enthusiasm at Despite fears of inflation, supply chain issues, skyrocketing energy and home prices and global instability caused by the Ukraine crisis, CIOs and IT buyers continue to expect overall spending to increase more than 6% in 2022. While this is lower than our 8% prediction made in January of this year, it remains in line with last year’s roughly 6-7% growth Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more.

The When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management.

Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches.

The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates.

As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it.

Built on rigid infrastructure and managed by specialized gatekeepers, data warehouses of the past were, as one financial customer once told us, “like a snake swallowing a basketball.” Slide from Wikibon’s 2014 Big Data Capital Markets Event: The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every With Erik Bradley The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional In the 2010s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon Despite the more than $100B spent each year fighting cybercrime, when we do an end of year look back and ask, “how did we do” — the answer is invariably the same; worse than last year. Pre-pandemic, the picture was disheartening. But since March of 2020 the situation has only worsened as cybercriminals have become increasingly sophisticated, better funded and Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead.

Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance What Could Disrupt Amazon? Weigh in and take the survey. Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture.

We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging.

It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work Cisco is a company at the crossroads.

That’s a substantial chunk of market opportunity that is growing Following a 4-5% contraction in 2020, we expect a 6-7% increase in 2021 technology spending. Key drivers are: 1) Continued fine-tuning of and investment in digital strategies– e.g. cloud, security, AI, data, and automation; 2) Application modernization initiatives (e.g. containers); 3) Steady remote workforce infrastructure investment; and 4) Pent up demand for data center infrastructure (e.g. servers, storage & networking on-prem). Best of theCUBE on Cloud The next ten years of cloud will differ dramatically from the past decade. The early days of cloud deployed virtualization of standard off-the-shelf components to scale out and build a large distributed system. The coming decade will see a much more data-centric, real time, intelligent, hyper-decentralized cloud that will comprise on-prem, hybrid, cross cloud and Much of the discussion around Intel’s current challenges is focused on manufacturing issues and its ongoing market share skirmish with AMD. Of course that’s understandable. But the core issue Intel faces is it has lost the volume game, forever. When it comes to silicon, volume is king. As such, incoming CEO Pat Gelsinger faces some difficult decisions. On the one In our 2020 Enterprise Technology Predictions post we said that organizations would slow down experimentation this year and begin to operationalize their digital transformation PoCs. We also said that, based on spending data, cyber security companies like Crowdstrike and Okta were poised to rise above the rest in 2020 along with an accelerated pace of cloud migrations. And we said New data suggests that tech spending will be higher than we previously thought for 2021. COVID learnings, a faster than expected vaccine rollout, productivity gains and broad-based cloud leverage, lead us to raise our outlook for next year. We now expect a 3-5% increase in 2021 technology spending, roughly double our previously forecasted growth rate.

The year 2020 has acted as a hasty but effective proof of concept for how to digitally transform businesses. CIOs report that generally, technology spending levels have either rebounded or will do so in the near future, Cloud computing has been the single most transformative force in IT over the last decade – what will Cloud 2030 look like? As we enter the 2020s, we believe that cloud will become the underpinning of a ubiquitous, intelligent and autonomous resource that will disrupt the operational stacks of virtually every company in all industries. This Breaking Analysis is a CISOs see Permanent Shifts in Cyber Strategies due to COVID & Remote Work As we’ve reported extensively, the pandemic has affected cyber security markets perhaps more than any other. Remote work has caused CISOs to shift spending priorities toward identity access management, endpoint and cloud security. COVID has been a benefactor for nextgen security companies that participate in these sectors. Fixing A Flawed Data Warehouse Model Snowflake will not grow into its valuation by simply stealing share from the on-prem data warehouse vendors. Even if it got 100% of the data warehouse business it wouldn’t come close to justifying its market cap. Rather Snowflake must create an entirely new market based on completely changing the way organizations think about monetizing Despite softer tech spending, cloud revenue shows continued momentum into 2021. As we watch an historic election unfold before our eyes, we look back at the early days of this millennium and the memorable presidential race of 2000. That decade was defined by 9/11, which permanently re-shaped our thinking. We exited the ’00s at the tail end of a massive Azure cloud is the linchpin of Microsoft’s go forward innovation strategy.

Of course As we reported in our last update, tech spending overall continues to be significantly muted relative to 2019– CIOs Report a Cautious Outlook for Q4 Tech Spending. We currently project a 4 to 5 percent decline in 2020 spending and a tepid 2 percent increase in 2021. Nonetheless, there continue to be some sector and vendor bright spots in an CIOs Report Slow Thaw of Spending Freezes. In the most recent September ETR spending survey, CIOs expect a slight sequential improvement in Q4 spending relative to Q3– but still down 4% from Q4 2019. So the picture is still not pretty but not bleak either. Firms are adjusting to the “new abnormal” and are taking positive actions that can be Application performance management (APM) has been around since the days of the mainframe. As systems architectures became more complex, the technology evolved to accommodate client server, Web tier architectures, mobile and now cloud-based systems.

Are we now going to see Enterprise software markets are dominated by mega cap companies like SAP, Oracle, Salesforce and Microsoft. SaaS leaders like ServiceNow and Workday have solidified their market positions by to a great extent, replicating the Salesforce model in their respective domains. There is still room for innovative upstarts that are introducing new cloud native services and value pricing models but the traditional Cloud, IAM & Endpoint Security are rocking the markets. Over the past 150 days, everyone in the technology industry has become an expert on COVID in some way shape or form.

We have all lived the reality that COVID-19 has accelerated by at least 2 years, many trends that were in motion well before the virus hit. The cyber security Cloud Remains Strong but not Immune to COVID. While cloud computing is generally seen as a bright spot in tech spending, the sector is not immune from the effects of COVID-19. It’s better to be cloud than not cloud, no question, but recent survey data shows that the V-shaped recovery in the stock market looks much more like a square RPA competitors vie for a bigger prize… RPA Leads all Sectors in Spending Intentions Robotic process automation (RPA) solutions remain one of the most attractive investments for business technology buyers. This despite our overall 2020 tech spending forecasts, which remain at the depressed levels of -4% to -5% for the year.

ETR’s Erik Bradley provides data and insights from customer roundtable discussions and Oracle Autonomous Database on Exadata Cloud@Customer and Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is a radical approach at bringing cloud services on-premises. Our initial take is those substantial customers running mission-critical Oracle applications can cut costs by up to 40% with this offering. This strategy is the most ambitious attempt we’ve seen in the industry to bring a full public cloud experience to organizations’ premises. Global 2000 customers running mission-critical large-scale applications on Oracle Databases should assume that they will migrate to one of Oracle’s new Cloud@Custmer offerings. Wikibon recommends that CxOs begin engaging with Oracle to conduct their TCO/ROI/IRR analyses now. Despite its faster growth in infrastructure-as-a-service relative to AWS and Azure, Google Cloud Platform remains a third wheel in the race for cloud dominance. Google begins its Cloud Next online event starting July 14th in a series of nine rolling sessions through early September.

New Cloud Workloads As we’ve reported, there is a new class of workloads emerging in the cloud. Early cloud was all about infrastructure-as-a-service ( IaaS). That is, the spinning up Data shows that most CIOs expect a U-Shaped recovery from COVID-19. Specifically, 44% of roughly 700 executives surveyed believe revenue declines will continue through most of 2020 with growth returning next year. This is a key finding of the latest flash survey data from ETR. Not surprisingly however, the shape of the recovery will be mixed and vary substantially by CIOs and IT execs report strong RPA adoption plans in a post-pandemic environment.

Wikibon also projects that True Private Cloud Server SAN will make some headway together with Hyperscale Server SAN in public cloud storage. Definitions for the Wikibon Server SAN classifications are Premise. The digital twin programming concept will extend well beyond IoT. It presents a richer representation of real things that traditional programming technologies. Users need conventions for core concepts and how they fit together. In our conversations with the Wikibon community, we hear both interest and confusion regarding the notion of digital twins. We believe digital twins will have enormous If you’ve been following IBM’s strategic moves over the past 6 months in data and analytics, it’s hard not to have some concerns. The announcements they’ve been making this year err on the side of excessive caution. What they illustrate is IBM Analytics’ ongoing retrenchment into mainframes, private clouds, and end-to-end data governance. IBM seems to be re-crafting its core Wikibon projects that 3D XPoint will not make it in volume in either the enterprise or consumer markets; it may reside in some specialist application niches. The areas of uniqueness claimed for 3D XPoint will be addressed by DRAM, 3D NAND, and innovative non-volatile combinations of DRAM and 3D NAND. CIOs and CTOs should assume 3D XPoint will NOT be important to the enterprise, and not evaluate it further. The focus should be on deployment of 3D NAND technologies, and expect a rapid cadence of increases in performance, density, form factor, and volume. Hybrid DIMMs with DRAM and 3D NAND should also be evaluated as the technologies mature, as well as UniGrid Architectures. Premise By mid 2018, 3D NAND will become the backbone of almost all deliveries and all vendors of NAND flash, to both the consumer and enterprise markets, with a clear path to increased density, higher performance, and decreasing cost. Consumer NAND announcements are a leading indicator of enterprise NAND capabilities. Toshiba Consumer SSD NAND Announcement The concept of Private Cloud has been in the market since 2008, but the ability of IT organizations to build Private Cloud services that match Public Cloud have been limited. Wikibon forecasts the Private Cloud market revenues from 2015-2026, as well as introducing the enhanced concept of “True” Private Cloud. As more companies transition into digital businesses, it is critical to understand the business and technology trends that will shape Cloud Computing for the next decade. Wikibon examines the critical elements to help companies understand this rapidly evolving landscape and marketplace. Customers are asking how to choose from the rich and growing array of tools in the Hadoop ecosystem. Part of the consideration centers on how to insulate them from fragmentation in the continually evolving Hadoop ecosystem. The incredibly rapid pace of innovation distinguishes the ecosystem but it also has its downsides. The mix and match richness of choice introduces complexity for administrators and developers. At some point it makes sense for customers to consider investing in tools that can hide much of that complexity in data ready for analysis. To be clear, there is no magic product that can hide all these technologies. But when customers take the perspective of simplifying specific end-to-end processes, solutions are available to address the problem. IT leaders can no longer treat stream processors as esoteric functionality employed solely by leading-edge consumer Internet services. They are becoming core functionality that works side-by-side with the more familiar batch processing engines such as Hive, HBase, or Impala. Application developers that need near real-time functionality can start to evaluate stream processors as part of design patterns. However, their analytics functionality is still a bit primitive and most of them need a lot of hardening in order to be resilient enough for mainstream customers.

Wikibon Research has forecasted Public Cloud revenues from 2015 through 2026; with the expectations that 33% of all IT spending ($500B) will move to Public Cloud services within the next decade. The impact this will have on IT vendors and IT strategy will be significant as more applications focus on mobile and real-time data analytics. In this research paper, Wikibon looks back at the introductory Server SAN research, adjusts the Server SAN definition to include System Drag, and increases the speed of adoption of Server SAN based on very fast adoption from 2012 to 2014. The overall growth of Server SAN is projected to be about a 23% CAGR from 2014 to 2026, with a faster growth from 2014 to 2020 of 38%. The total Server SAN market is projected to grow to over $48 billion by 2026. The traditional enterprise storage market is projected to decline by -16% CAGR, leading to an overall growth in storage spend of 3% CAGR through 2026. Traditional enterprise storage is being squeezed in a vice between a superior, lower cost and more flexible storage model with Enterprise Server SAN, and the migration of IT towards cloud computing and Hyperscale Server SAN deployments. Wikibon strongly recommends that CTOs & CIOs initiate Server SAN pilot projects in 2015, particularly for applications where either low cost or high performance is required. Mainstream IT, LoB execs and application development professionals each provide different yet critical perspectives to Systems of Intelligence. IT exes must be in a position to deliver the right infrastructure (e.g. cloud, on-prem, etc.) with the proper performance and SLA profile to support LoB requirements. Line-of-Business execs must have enough knowledge to specify the real-time needs of applications while application development pros must ensure the right skills are in place to deliver and maintain services to Systems of Intelligence over a full life cycle. The Big Data market continued its maturation in 2014, experiencing both significant growth as measured by vendor revenue and increased adoption of Big Data tools and technologies by large enterprises across vertical markets. In this exclusive report for Wikibon Premium members, Wikibon details Big Data vendor revenue and extends its groundbreaking market forecast through 2020. Converged infrastructure is a trend that has been growing for over 5 years and is rapidly transforming the way that users consume IT. In 2012, Wikibon forecasted (see Converged Infrastructure Takes the Market By Storm) that 2/3 of infrastructure for enterprise applications would be packaged as some form of converged infrastructure by 2017. Now there are billions of dollars of Hortonworks plans to go public in 2015 and its S-1 filing, revealed to the world yesterday, says a lot about the state of the Hadoop market generally and, obviously, Hortonworks specifically.

The company’s fourth quarter results were particularly weak, coming in 5.5% below expectations.

Effective business analytics – from basic reporting to advanced data mining and predictive analytics — allows data analysts and business users alike to extract insights from corporate data that, when translated into action, deliver higher levels of efficiency and profitability to the enterprise. Underlying every business analytics practice is data. Traditionally, this meant structured data created and stored by enterprises themselves, such as customer data housed in CRM applications, operational data stored in ERP systems or financial data tallied in accounting databases. But the volume and type of data now available to enterprises — and the need to analyze it in near-real time for maximum business value — is growing rapidly thanks to the popularity of social media and networking services like Facebook and Twitter, data-generating sensor equipped and networked devices, both machine- and human-generated online transactions, and other sources of unstructured and semi-structured data.

No more FOMO. Any tips on which filaments to order for a first timer? Just ordered the P2S combo from the deal, hoping to print using only PLA for board game inserts, basic models and things like that :) PLA will be the easiest to print with - for models, I recommend PLA Meta, which is great for printing fine details, and comes in a lot of colour variety (which conveniently is the cheapest in this deal!). TPU is surprisingly handy too, so I'd recommend grabbing a roll of that to play with, great when you need something nearly indestructible and rubbery. If you're after some stronger materials, PETG is a good starter option too, but I tend to find I'm not using it too much due to it never printing as nicely as PLA or ABS. ABS and ASA create some noxious odours when printing, and have a tendency to warp, so may cause problems when printing, but have extra heat resistance and strength that can be useful. Your printer will handle these and the higher-grade engineering filaments too (like carbon fibre filaments, nylon, polycarbonate, or PPA) but PLA Meta is a really great start point. Thank you so much for your detailed reply, I really appreciate it! Possibly the most helpful reply I've seen on ozb in the last week or two! Everyone be more like Flippsy PLA is much easier to use. If you are using it for board game inserts, you will want more grey as it looks nicer. You might also want a variety of different colours if you are printing tokens. So for wood pieces you might want chocolate as a colour or red/blue/yellow/green to print player dashboards for something like Catan. Congrats! I bought the P1S for my 10yr old during their Anniversary Sale. The P2S looks to be a step up. matte PLA is great for board game inserts Getting eBay forcing a postage cost on a random filament when in cart, even though items say free postage on the item page. when I remove the product that has postage, it adds it to another one that didn't have postage cost before, anyone else seeing this too? I had this when it didn't like my postage address. It would add $10 postage. When I updated the suburb and postcode it went back to free. Excludes QLD South East? I'm South East and just checked the first link, I get free shipping and can use that code? Yeah the coverage is a bit more than those exclusions - I've updated the post to be a bit more accurate. Some stores will also ship to regional areas and charge a fee. South East QLD is where the capital city is though heh Anyone have any experience with PLA meta? Is it any different from PLAs you can get from Bambu's official store? I use PLA meta for printing figurines and models, I find that it has less noticeable layer lines and a smooth finish without being overly shiny, compared to the other PLAs. One minor downside is that when printing with supports, the scarring can be a bit more noticeable compared to PLA matte or PLA+, leaving white discolouration. It's pretty comparable to Bambu's PLA basic, just a lot cheaper. Awesome, thanks for sharing! nice work @Flippsy Nice deals but will wait for black friday.

Title: Lifespan of AI Chips: The $300 Billion Question

Subscribe Mihir Kshirsagar Comments Authored by: Mihir Kshirsagar This week, Open AI announced a multibillion dollar deal with Broadcom to develop custom AI chips for data centers projected to consume 10 gigawatts of power. This investment is separate from another multibillion dollar deal OpenAI struck with AMD last week. There is no question that we are in the midst of making one of the largest industrial infrastructure bets in United States history. Eight major companies—Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, Oracle, OpenAI, and others—are expected to invest over $300 billion in AI infrastructure in 2025 alone. Spurred by news about the vendor-financed structure of the AMD investment and a conversation with my colleague Arvind Narayanan, I started to investigate the unit economics of the industry from a competition perspective. What I have found so far is surprising. It appears that we’re making important decisions about who gets to compete in AI based on financial assumptions that may be systematically overstating the long-run sustainability of the industry by a factor of two. That said, I am open to being wrong in my analysis and welcome corrections as I write these thoughts up in an academic article with my colleague Felix Chen. Here is the puzzle: the chips at the heart of the infrastructure buildout have a useful lifespan of one to three years due to rapid technological obsolescence and physical wear, but companies depreciate them over five to six years. In other words, they spread out the cost of their massive capital investments over a longer period than the facts warrant—what The Economist has referred to as the “$4trn accounting puzzle at the heart of the AI cloud.” This accounting mismatch has significant competition implications, especially upstream of the model layer of the GenAI stack. (Figure 1.) In the application layer enterprises choose AI models to integrate into their operations. Incumbent coalitions—hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) partnered with their model developers (OpenAI, Anthropic)—can effectively subsidize application-layer pricing during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. This could create advantages that prove insurmountable even when better technology becomes available. The core issue isn’t whether chips wear out faster than accounting suggests. It’s whether the market structure being formed is fueled by accounting conventions that obscure true long-run economics, allowing incumbent coalitions to establish customer lock-in at the application layer before true costs become visible. In other words, the accounting subsidy creates a window of roughly three to six years where reported costs are artificially low. After that, the overlapping depreciation schedules catch up to operational reality. Here’s why this timing matters: that three-to-six-year window is precisely when the market structure for AI applications is being determined. Customer relationships are being formed. Enterprise integrations are being built. Multi-year contracts are being signed. Switching costs are accumulating. By the time the accounting catches up—when companies face the full weight of replacement costs hitting their income statements—the incumbent coalitions will have already locked in their customer base. The temporary subsidy enables permanent competitive advantage. Even if we ignore the accounting question, a September 2025 Bain report estimates that AI firms will face an annual $800 billion revenue hole in 2030 to fund their capital expenses—a gap larger than Amazon’s entire annual revenue. Per my calculations, this hole grows to over $1.5 trillion annually if the true total cost of ownership is taken into account. (For reference, that is roughly equivalent to the size of the global foodservice industry.) Even assuming these self-reported figures are inflated by 50%, the revenue challenge remains unprecedented in scale. If these coalitions establish durable customer relationships in the initial years, the market structure crystallized during this window may persist regardless of whether the underlying investment economics are sustainable at true replacement costs. The lessons from the efforts to unwind Google’s dominance of the search market are instructive here. Technical analyses have converged on estimating the useful lifespan of AI chips at one to three years. One unnamed Google architect assessed that GPUs running at 60-70% utilization—standard for AI workloads—survive one to two years, with three years as a maximum. The reason: thermal and electrical stress is simply too high. But physical failure isn’t the only concern. Technological obsolescence drives replacement cycles. Nvidia’s GB200 (“Blackwell”) chip provides 4-5x faster inference than the H100. When competitors deploy hardware with significantly better performance, three-year-old chips become economically obsolete even if they still function. Investment analysts have run the numbers on what happens if accounting catches up to reality. Barclays, for example, is cutting earnings forecasts of AI firms by up to 10% for 2025 to account for more realistic depreciation assumptions. The physical evidence, the technological trajectory, and the emerging financial data all point in the same direction: actual useful life is at least half the accounting life, and this does not even account for the significant operational expenditures required. These aren’t loose partnerships—they’re deeply integrated coalitions where the hyperscaler’s infrastructure economics directly enable their coalition’s competitive positioning at the application layer. True outsiders trying to compete at the application layer include companies like Cohere (enterprise-focused models), AI21 Labs, Mistral, and application builders like Harvey (legal AI), Glean (enterprise search), and Writer (enterprise content). Many have struggled to scale or ended up partnering with hyperscalers—Mistral now has a partnership with Microsoft, and Cohere partners with Oracle. The emerging pattern suggests that coalition membership is becoming necessary for survival. The accounting subsidy creates competitive advantages that flow through the coalition structure. A recent McKinsey analysis projects that approximately 60% of AI infrastructure spending in the next five years goes to computing hardware (chips, servers, memory), 25% to power and cooling infrastructure, and 15% to physical construction. Assuming half of the infrastructure spending goes to computing hardware with 1-3 year useful life: companies can depreciate this hardware over 5-6 years rather than the realistic 1-3 years. This effectively halves their reported annual depreciation expense. This cushion between reported costs and actual replacement economics creates a capital subsidy that allows coalition leaders to subsidize application-layer pricing, expand capacity faster than true economics justify, and report profitability metrics that attract capital on more favorable terms than their operational reality warrants. The Microsoft-OpenAI Example Microsoft’s Azure AI infrastructure investments, when depreciated over six years rather than the more realistic three years, allow Microsoft to report more attractive margins on its infrastructure business. Consider Microsoft’s ~$80 billion annual AI infrastructure spend. If half goes to computing hardware with a true three-year lifespan, Microsoft faces actual replacement costs of approximately $13 billion per year. But by depreciating over six years, Microsoft’s reported annual depreciation is only $6.5 billion—creating an apparent $6.5 billion annual cushion. This cushion enables Microsoft to subsidize OpenAI’s infrastructure costs during the critical years when customer relationships are being formed. OpenAI can price its APIs aggressively to win enterprise customers while operating on a cost structure that wouldn’t be sustainable at true market rates for infrastructure. Microsoft benefits because every enterprise customer that integrates OpenAI’s models becomes more deeply embedded in the Azure ecosystem. The same pattern holds for Amazon-Anthropic. Amazon’s AWS can depreciate AI infrastructure over extended periods, subsidize Anthropic’s infrastructure costs through favorable terms, and benefit from the resulting AWS consumption as Anthropic wins customers. Incumbent coalitions can: New entrants—whether independent model developers or application builders—face steeper economics. Even with access to chips at market rates, they can’t match the pricing of model developers whose infrastructure is subsidized by hyperscaler partners using six-year depreciation. Their profitability looks worse on paper, making it harder to raise capital and compete for customers during the critical window when market structure is being determined. The strategic bet: By years 4-5, when accounting reality might catch up to operational reality, customer relationships will be locked in through switching costs, integration depth, and organizational inertia. The durability of incumbent advantages involves some complex projections. Let me lay out three scenarios and examine how the accounting subsidy affects competition in each. If frontier models keep improving meaningfully with more compute, then training capacity matters more than inference efficiency. This is a strong assumption that does not appear supported by current science. Nevertheless, playing out this world, we see that model quality differentiates providers, customers pay premium prices for frontier capabilities, and incumbent coalitions who built massive training capacity have lasting advantages. The moat is capability-based, reinforced by infrastructure scale. Incumbent coalitions face profitability pressure when accounting catches up to operational reality, but they retain competitive advantages through superior models. New entrants with better unit economics can’t easily compete because the game is about model quality, not inference cost. The capital requirements are enormous and ongoing. Whoever builds scale first maintains advantages. There is also a policy question about whether private capital can sustain the hundred of billions in annual replacement cycles indefinitely, or whether maintaining leadership requires ongoing policy support once true costs become visible. If model capabilities hit diminishing returns and most models become “good enough,” competition shifts to inference efficiency, cost, and building applications. When the market power moves upstream, that creates the most troubling competitive dynamics. In this world, models plateau in capability, inference costs have fallen dramatically, and open source models match or approach proprietary quality. But incumbent coalitions who built scale in the early years retain advantages through: New entrants might have better unit economics, but if switching costs are high enough, customers stick. This is where the Google search case becomes the crucial analytical framework. The Justice Department’s case against Google in search provides a roadmap for understanding how customer lock-in can persist even when competitive alternatives exist with comparable or better economics. Google maintained search dominance through default placements and integration lock-in. Google paid billions annually to be the default search engine on Safari, Android devices, and elsewhere. These defaults created inertia: users rarely switched even when alternatives were “one click away.” The court found this lock-in was anticompetitive. The insight for AI infrastructure is that even in a market where switching takes literally a few clicks, default positions and integration created durable advantages that competitors couldn’t overcome with better economics or comparable quality. Now consider that switching costs are far higher in the AI market: In other words, the lock-in is to the entire hyperscaler infrastructure stack. If Google could maintain dominance in search with relatively low switching costs, how much more durable might AI application-layer lock-in prove when enterprises are deeply integrated into coalition stacks? There is an alternative scenario where the competitive effects could be less severe. Here, models plateau, inference commoditizes, and switching costs prove lower than expected. APIs standardize across providers, models are equally capable, price becomes the primary differentiator, and integration depth matters less than anticipated. New entrants can now compete effectively on price and service, leveraging newer, more efficient infrastructure. The early years’ investment by incumbents might look wasteful in retrospect. Better technology in newer chips defeats scale advantages on older infrastructure. For competition, this means there is no permanent foreclosure—just wasteful spending that created temporary advantages and shaped the market structure during a critical period, even though those advantages don’t persist. The short answer is that we don’t know yet. The available evidence suggests model capabilities have plateaued and inference scaling is the name of the game. As a result, inference costs will fall, but we don’t know how dramatically. Customer lock-in at the application layer might prove durable (like Google search) or weaker than expected. If we’re in Scenario B (models plateau, enterprise lock-in), the accounting subsidy lets incumbent coalitions foreclose competition at the application layer during the critical window, and switching costs prevent correction even when better alternatives emerge. This is the Google search outcome. If we’re in Scenario C (models plateau, low switching costs), the asset-life treatment enables wasteful overinvestment that may temporarily distort competition, but it does not create permanent harm to the market structure. One intuitive consideration is that better chips and algorithms should undermine incumbent advantages over time. The problem is that technology improvement helps everyone, but it helps incumbents more when lock-in exists. For coalitions with locked-in customers, capability expands through replacement spending alone. They are continuously upgrading infrastructure, and existing customers automatically benefit. New entrants with better technology have lower unit economics, but they still must acquire customers. This is challenging when customers are already integrated with the OpenAI APIs through Azure, operating under multi-year contracts, built compliance frameworks around the incumbent stack, facing switching costs that exceed savings from better technology, and receiving continuous capability upgrades from their current provider. The core insight from the Google search case: the technology deflation curve that should enable new entry actually reinforces incumbent advantages when lock-in is strong. The competitive dynamics become more concerning when combined with the circular financing structure at the heart of the AI infrastructure boom. The circular structure reinforces the coalition dynamics and makes it harder for new entrants to compete in the future. Nvidia has embarked on a strategy of making strategic equity investments in its customers. CoreWeave is the clearest example. Nvidia owns roughly 7% of the company, a stake worth about $3 billion as of June 2025. CoreWeave has purchased at least 250,000 Nvidia GPUs—mostly H100s at roughly $30,000 each, totaling around $7.5 billion. Essentially, all the money Nvidia invested in CoreWeave has come back as revenue. In turn, CoreWeave signed $22.4 billion in contracts with OpenAI to provide AI infrastructure. Nvidia participated in OpenAI’s $6.6 billion funding round in October 2024, then announced a $100 billion investment commitment in September 2025. The circle takes shape: Nvidia invests in OpenAI. OpenAI signs contracts with CoreWeave. CoreWeave buys GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia has equity in CoreWeave. The money flows in a loop, with each transaction appearing as legitimate revenue or investment depending on which company’s books you examine. Not many details have been released about the AMD deal with OpenAI, but reports suggest it involves similar features of circular financing. We’ve seen circular vendor financing disrupt market structures before. During the late 1990s telecom boom, equipment makers financed their own customers to drive sales. Lucent offered $8.1 billion in vendor financing ($15.8 billion in today’s dollars), which represented 24% of revenue. Nortel had $3.1 billion ($6.0 billion today). And Cisco was $2.4 billion ($4.7 billion today). The strategy: lend money to cash-strapped telecom companies so they could buy your equipment. Everyone wins. You book revenue. Your customers build networks. The market bids up your stock. Repeat. Until the music stopped. Forty-seven competitive local exchange carriers went bankrupt between 2000 and 2003. When customers defaulted, vendor financing became bad debt. Lucent wrote off $3.5 billion in customer loans. Today’s numbers are larger. Nvidia’s disclosed investments and financing commitments total roughly $110 billion against $165 billion in last-twelve-months revenue. That’s 67% of revenue—nearly three times Lucent’s exposure at the peak. There are crucial differences. First, there are no allegations of fraud or any untoward activity. Second, the competitive implications differ because of asset lifespans. In telecom, assets had long useful lives. When companies went bankrupt, carriers could buy that fiber at fire-sale prices and use it for decades. The short lifespan of AI chips changes this fundamentally. If the current buildout proves excessive and coalitions face financial pressure, excess capacity won’t be available for new entrants to acquire and deploy effectively. Three-year-old chips at fire-sale prices don’t provide a competitive foundation when incumbent coalitions are running current-generation hardware. Even if the circular financing unwinds, it won’t necessarily enable competitive entry at the application layer. The evidence shows that the market structure is being determined by competition among 3 coalitions, with no realistic path for true outsiders to compete at the application layer during the critical window when customer relationships are being formed. Competition authorities are starting to look at market concentration in AI, focusing on traditional antitrust metrics: market share, pricing power, exclusionary conduct. As far as I know, the competitive effects of vendor financing and accounting policy have not yet been discussed extensively. Two policy proposals can help maintain competition. First, enhanced disclosure requirements about capital and operating costs. Any AI infrastructure project receiving government support should disclose realistic useful life assumptions for hardware, expected replacement schedules and costs, total capital requirements under multiple technology scenarios, relationships between vendor financing and equipment procurement, partnership economics showing how infrastructure costs flow from hyperscalers to model developers, and analysis of customer lock-in mechanisms at the application layer. Second, developing interoperability standards to prevent lock in. Interoperable standards on model APIs and cloud integration frameworks make it easier for enterprises to switch between providers. The Google search remedy focused on reducing switching costs—the same principle applies here. In summary, the market structure for AI firms is coalescing around models that rely on a combination of massive capital flows, circular financing structures, and accounting assumptions that may not match operational reality. The accounting subsidy enables incumbent coalitions to establish market share in the early years, when critical customer relationships at the application layer are being formed. The Google search case demonstrates that lock-in can be decisive even with low switching costs. AI application-layer integration has far higher switching costs. As I’ve said, we don’t yet know which scenario we’re in. But the decisions being made now—based on assumptions that may overstate financial sustainability by a factor of two—are determining the future market for AI services at the application level.

Title: AI Won’t Replace Jobs, but Tech Bros Want You to Be Afraid It Will

reading time 5 minutes AI is overrated, according to author Cory Doctorow. “I don’t think AI can do your job,” Doctorow said, but despite that, bosses across industries are “insatiably horny” about the idea that AI will replace jobs. Top of the list is tech bosses. Tech is one of the industries where AI is scaling significantly faster in the workforce than average (the bigger picture corporate AI adoption is much slower, and some studies claim the returns on investments are low). Many tech CEOs have made statements expressing their wishes to automate tasks that would have regularly gone to human workers. A new report by Source, a consulting firm that works with the tech industry, claimed that over half of tech companies are considering restructuring because of AI. “Tech bosses love the story of AI replacing programmers,” Doctorow said at an event hosted by the Brooklyn Public Library last week, where he was answering former FTC chair Lina Khan’s questions. During her tenure in the Biden administration, Khan was known for her firm regulatory stance against big tech monopolies. Computer programming was once the most lucrative industry to go into, with a surplus of demand for workers; there were numerous job opportunities with great pay and benefits, and cushy amenities. Now, the script has completely switched. Many have blamed the rise of generative AI for it. But Doctorow argues “that’s just not a thing AI is doing” or even can do. “AI can write sub-routines, it can’t do software architecture. Can’t do engineering, because engineering is about having a long, broad context window to understand all the pieces that came before, all the pieces that are coming in the future, and the pieces that sit adjacent to code, and if you know anything about AI, the one thing that is most expensive to do with AI is expanding the context window,” Doctorow said. Doctorow is famous for having coined the term “enshittification” to describe the common, modern-day phenomenon of almost every tech platform becoming soulless, dysfunctional and widely-hated corpses that internet users are still trapped under.Â It’s a cathartically profane critique of capitalism in the tech age that Macquaire Dictionary picked as its word of the year in 2024. He argues that what tech bosses actually like is to have tech workers “terrified that they’re about to be replaced by a chatbot, it gives them a chance to put them in their place.” To understand why, you need to look into how the dynamic has changed in the tech workplace in the past two decades. “The way that tech bosses motivated tech workers was appealing to their sense of mission,” Doctorow said. It was a double-edged sword: it both motivated the tech workers to work grueling hours, but it also made them passionate about the product and its purpose. So, if the boss decided to make changes at the expense of that vision of greater good and in the pursuit of greater margins, the workers tended to fight for the user. One example of that was the Google employee protests over the controversial military AI initiative Project Maven, which successfully saw the tech giant walk back its involvement. Back then, Doctorow argues, tech workers were a good way to keep the industry in check because they had a sense of purpose and they had power. Demand for workers far exceeded the supply, so if things were going awry in the company’s progress towards its mission, they could threaten to leave. There were many other opportunities that they could switch to. But things have since changed, and supply has caught up with demand. Roughly 400,000 tech employees have been laid off in the past two years alone. Silicon Valley companies are asking their employees to work 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week, a schedule known as “996” that was popularized in China. Meanwhile, big tech companies are spending big and making record profits. Nvidia just became the first and only company to hit a $4.5 trillion market cap. The power dynamic has now switched, and the power is with the bosses. And this time around, according to Doctorow, they want to make sure that the power dynamic stays that way. “Tech bosses have shown us how they treat workers they’re not afraid of,” Doctorow said, pointing the finger at Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Federal injury data from 2022 found that Amazon warehouse workers were seriously injured at more than twice the rate at other warehouses. A subsequent Senate probe from 2024 concluded that Amazon had been manipulating its self-reported injury data to make its warehouses appear safer. “The minute Jeff Bezos can put a piss jar next to your workstation, he will,” Doctorow said. “At this point, when Google is firing 12,000 workers, and then doing a $70 billion stock buyback that would have paid their wages for the next 27 years, you need a union,” he advised. If Doctorow’s estimates are true, then AI won’t take over any jobs. But then what about the billions and billions of dollars that have been poured into the AI industry, so much so that those investments are almost entirely driving American economic growth? “The great kind of tragedy and terror of all of this is that AI, if it can’t do your job, then whatever benefits we get from it are not commensurate with the capital expenditures that we’ve made for it, nor will they be sufficiently profitable to incur the operational expenses associated with maintaining these large foundation models,” Doctorow said. TLDR on that: He thinks there is an AI bubble. And he is not alone in thinking like this; many other experts have been sounding the alarms of a rapidly growing AI bubble. In a notable addition this week, the United Kingdom’s central bank said that “equity market valuations appear stretched, particularly for technology companies focused on Artificial Intelligence,” and that this could lead to a sudden, sharp correction. The Bank said that stock market price valuations were comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble, and that the market share of the top five members of the S&P 500 was at its highest concentration in 50 years. Those five are the AI-heavy big tech giants Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Meta. Lina Khan painted a picture of some other reasons why experts believe there is an AI bubble at the event on Thursday. “There have been increasing discussion about how we may actually be just seeing a big AI bubble,” the former FTC chair said. “We’re seeing all of these circular investments where it’s like the same five to seven companies just handing each other big bags of cash, saying, IOU, we’re seeing, you know, increasing reporting in the business press that even though we’re seeing such significant investment in AI, increasingly, firms are being candid that they don’t know what the profitable use case is going to be, but are just kind of afraid of missing out.” In her time in office, Khan’s FTC opened inquiries into the various deals and partnerships between big tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft and the then-rising, now-reigning AI labs OpenAI and Anthropic. A bubble is worrying. A pop is even more worrisome. “I think we’re going to see a collapse, and it’s going to be very bad,” Doctorow said. “I think 2008 is going to look like a golden age when AI pops.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Drive more traffic to your site. Use AI to save time doing SEO tasks. Make SEO easier. And get 24/7 support. Includes Local SEO, Video SEO & News SEO. Heads up! Black Friday is almost here, and if you still haven’t prepared, it’s time to act fast. The clock is ticking, but you can still make meaningful updates that count. This article covers practical and straightforward last minute Black Friday tips to help you make quick, effective changes to your eCommerce store. Even with just a few days left, there’s still room to attract customers and make the most of the biggest shopping event of the year. Did you know? Numbers show that Black Friday 2024 broke all records, as U.S. shoppers spent a staggering $ 10.8 billion online, representing a 10.2 percent increase from 2023. These numbers prove one thing: it is never too late to take action and grab your share of the Black Friday rush. The fastest way to put your Black Friday campaign on pilot mode is by focusing on a few essentials that make an immediate difference. These must-do, last minute Black Friday tips are your quick wins, helping you cover the basics, build momentum, and set up the foundation for a successful marketing campaign. When shoppers land on your website, your Black Friday deals should be impossible to miss. Highlight your best offers right on the homepage or add a static banner so visitors see them immediately. The clearer your offers are, the easier it is for customers to take action. One of the most innovative ways to increase engagement is by using countdown timers. They build urgency, encourage faster decisions, and make shoppers feel like they’re part of something time-sensitive. The Diamond Store saw this in action when they added a live countdown clock to their 24-hour Black Friday email campaign. The result? A 400% higher conversion rate compared to their previous emails. For WordPress users, OptinMonster is a quick way to get started. It lets you create dynamic floating bars and banners with countdowns, all through a simple drag-and-drop builder. If you’re using Shopify, the Essential Countdown Timer Bar app works perfectly for creating announcement bars or cart countdowns to drive urgency and prevent cart abandonment. Did you know a long or confusing checkout process is one of the biggest reasons shoppers abandon their carts, especially during high-traffic days like Black Friday? That’s the last thing you want when every second counts. Before the rush begins, take a few minutes to go through your own checkout process on both desktop and mobile. Place a test order just like a customer would. Verify that your discount codes are applied correctly, your payment options load smoothly, and the overall flow feels quick and effortless. Read more: Boost your checkout page UX: Vital tips for online stores Ask a few friends, family members, or even teammates to try it too. Fresh eyes often spot friction points you might miss, such as unclear buttons, confusing forms, or slow-loading pages. Trust also plays a huge role. Ensure your checkout page displays secure payment badges and recognizable gateways, such as PayPal, Apple Pay, or Stripe. When shoppers feel confident their payment is safe, they’re far more likely to hit “Buy now.” And one last tip: keep it simple. The fewer distractions and clicks, the smoother the path to purchase. That’s precisely what drives conversions during a last minute Black Friday rush. Black Friday emails have been shown to generate 33 percent higher conversion rates than regular marketing messages. That alone makes it one of the smartest last minute Black Friday tips to focus on. When time is short, your existing customer base is your best asset. They already trust your brand and are far more likely to act quickly on your offers. Keep your email focused and straightforward. Start with a subject line that clearly highlights your best deal or most significant discount. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see how the key offer or discount is prominently displayed in the subject line, while the body reinforces the offer with a clear call to action. Inside the email, make your main offer impossible to miss. Emphasize the key benefits of your product or service, and include a direct call to action that takes users straight to your Black Friday sale page. Make it visually engaging by adding a countdown timer or a short GIF that brings energy and urgency to the message. Remember, this isn’t about crafting a perfect campaign. It’s about getting the right message to the right people at the right time. A simple, well-timed email can make a real difference in your Black Friday sales. Social media continues to play a significant role in Black Friday success. It has seen a 7 percent year-over-year increase in traffic, now driving around 10 percent of all global mobile traffic referrals during the holiday season. Your audience is already scrolling, searching, and shopping, so this is your opportunity to be where they are. In these last few days, your social media strategy should focus on building anticipation and trust. If you have customer review videos, testimonials, or any user-generated content, start sharing them now. Boosting these posts or running quick ad campaigns featuring real customer stories can help you build credibility fast. People are far more likely to buy when they see genuine experiences from others. You can also collaborate with a micro-influencer or a brand advocate who already has a connection with your target audience. Even a brief post, story, or reel from them can draw attention to your sale and help you gain visibility. If you are short on time, focus only on your most active platform, whether that is Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or LinkedIn. Post your best offer as a pinned post or a story highlight and use countdown stickers or short video snippets to create a sense of urgency. Lastly, remember to engage. Reply to comments, answer questions, and reshare posts from happy customers. Small interactions can make your brand feel more approachable and help you stand out during the Black Friday rush. Must read: How to handle comments on your blog If you haven’t touched your SEO yet, don’t worry. There’s still time to make a few quick updates that can help your store appear in the search results. These last minute Black Friday SEO tweaks can enhance visibility, attract the right audience, and might give your deals a competitive edge. Start with your meta titles and meta descriptions. Add words like Black Friday 2025, sale, or deal to your titles so searchers know what to expect. For example, instead of ‘Women’s handbags – Classic collection,’ you can try ‘Black Friday 2025 deals on women’s handbags.’ Keep it relevant, natural, and clear. Next, check your product and landing pages. Make sure they’re up to date with current pricing, stock status, and offers. Highlight the discounts in your product descriptions, and, if possible, include keywords that shoppers might search for, such as ‘best Black Friday deals’ or ‘holiday gift offers.’ Another smart move is to reuse your existing content. If you already have an older Black Friday or holiday gift guide, simply refresh it for 2025 by updating the year, offers, and internal links. It’s a fast way to keep your content relevant without having to start from scratch. Lastly, take a minute to review your page experience. A fast, mobile-friendly site can make or break your Black Friday sales. Run a quick check using Google’s PageSpeed Insights and fix anything that’s slowing your pages down. Even minor improvements can help increase conversions. These quick wins may not replace a comprehensive Black Friday SEO strategy. However, they can still make your website more discoverable and help you capture traffic from shoppers actively seeking deals. Okay, so the must-dos can help you frame a solid last minute marketing campaign. But if you’ve managed to check those off quickly and still have a little time on your hands, don’t stop there. The following few ideas may seem optional, but they can give your campaign the extra boost it needs to capture more attention, convert hesitant shoppers, and capitalize on the Black Friday rush. Don’t let potential buyers slip away after visiting your store. Retargeting ads help remind them of products they viewed or added to their carts, increasing the chances of conversion. Even a short, time-bound campaign with strong visuals and clear CTAs can make a difference during the Black Friday rush. Shoppers love convenience, especially during the holidays. Bundling complementary products or creating quick gift sets can simplify decision-making and increase your average order value. Highlight these as limited-time deals to develop a sense of urgency and drive faster sales. Many customers abandon their carts when questions go unanswered. Adding a live chat feature helps resolve last minute queries instantly and keeps buyers engaged throughout the checkout process. Tools like Tidio and LiveChat integrate seamlessly with both WordPress and Shopify, making setup quick and easy. Getting your offers in front of the right people starts with how your website appears and performs in search results. That’s where Yoast SEO can be a real game-changer during the Black Friday rush.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) stock dropped by 6% on October 14, and is now trading at $139. This decline was triggered by investor concern over new reports. Specifically, reports that Meta and Oracle plan to adopt NVIDIA's Spectrum-X Ethernet networking devices for their AI data centers were perceived as a significant competitive threat to Arista, a major provider of cloud networking solutions. Our algorithm-based multi-factor evaluation indicates that it might be the right time to purchase additional ANET shares. Overall, we maintain a positive outlook on the stock, and a target price of $181 seems feasible. We think there is nothing to fear in ANET stock, considering its overall Very Strong operational performance and financial health. Therefore, despite its Very High valuation, the stock is seen as Attractive but Volatile. Here is our evaluation: ANET stock has seen a notable decline recently, and we see it as attractive yet volatile. While this might seem like an opportunity, there is substantial risk in depending on a single stock. Conversely, a broader diversified strategy that we apply with the Trefis High Quality Portfolio provides significant value. Let us pose this question: Over the past 5 years, which index do you think the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed: the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The response may surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework assists in tilting the odds in your favor. Let’s delve into the details of each of the evaluated factors, but before that, for a quick background: With $174 Bil in market capitalization, Arista Networks delivers cloud networking solutions on a global scale, as well as post-contract services such as technical support, hardware repair, parts replacement, bug fixes, patches, and upgrades. This table illustrates how ANET is valued compared to the broader market. For more details, see: ANET Valuation Ratios This table shows how ANET is growing compared to the broader market. For additional details, see: ANET Revenue Comparison This table illustrates how ANET's profitability compares with the broader market. For further details, see: ANET Operating Income Comparison ANET has proven to be more resilient than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. Our assessment is based on (a) the extent of the stock's decline and (b) the speed of its recovery. 2022 Inflation Shock 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic However, the risk extends beyond significant market declines. Stocks can drop even in favorable market conditions – consider events like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in outlook. Review ANET Dip Buyer Analyses to observe how the stock has bounced back from sharp drops in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring 30 stocks, has consistently outperformed its benchmark that includes the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is this the case? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, leading to a smoother investment experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AI Bubble May Pop — Wiping Out $40 Trillion. Learn What Could Happen And What To Do

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. The GenAI boom faces significant risks, including a projected $1.5 trillion in debt for AI data centers by 2028 and a high failure rate (95%) for enterprise AI pilot projects.OpenAI's substantial cash burn and reliance on continuous capital raises make its financial stability a critical potential trigger for an industry downturn.The article outlines three possible futures: a soft landing, an OpenAI bankruptcy cascade, or a continued boom, with specific indicators for investors to monitor. The generative AI boom grew even bigger this week when Open AI announced its latest multibillion-dollar chip deal, this time with Broadcom – sending its stock up 10%, CNBC reported. The agreement, along with pacts with AMD and Oracle, is one of many that’s pumping money into an AI bubble that looks like it could end much like the dot-com bust did -- sending the Nasdaq down 78%. If such a value decimation began today, it would ultimately swipe $40 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. Or will the Gen AI boom continue for decades? Read on to learn how to tell which scenario is most likely. In March 2000, the dot-com bubble – which began with the 1995 initial public offering of Netscape – began bursting. The collapse subtracted $3.6 trillion from the Nasdaq’s market capitalization. There was also lots of debt -- $500 billion borrowed to build fiber optic networks went largely unrepaid due to the bankruptcy of telecom providers such as WorldCom and Global Crossing. While the Nasdaq began declining from its peak on March 10, two events on March 20, 2000 lit the fuse to this cash conflagration. That day "Burning Up," a Barron’s cover story by Jack Willoughby – who interviewed me for the article – was published. Willoughby’s column listed 51 publicly traded Internet firms he forecast would burn through their cash out of 207 by March 2001. That same day, MicroStrategy – whose CEO Michael Saylor is now Executive Chairman leading the renamed company’s strategy of selling stock to buy bitcoin – announced a revenue restatement for 1998 to 1999 due to "aggressive accounting practices," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. MicroStrategy’s accounting irregularities further shattered investor confidence. By April, the company also restated 1997 results – news of which sent the stock down 91% from its peak. The GenAI boom has certain parallels with the dot-com one. There is OpenAI – the cash incinerating startup driving the hype; debt-heavy infrastructure operators such as CoreWeave; and cash rich providers of customer financing – notably Nvidia and Oracle – to encourage those cash-burning startups to buy more of their picks and shovels, about which I wrote in my book Brain Rush. To build data centers, infrastructure operators are borrowing more than $1 trillion, according to a recent Morgan Stanley study. This could end badly if the cash required to repay that debt is insufficient to cover interest payments. I see three scenarios: GenAI keeps booming, there’s a soft-landing in which valuations decline somewhat, and the OpenAI bankruptcy scenario which brings it all down abruptly should the company be unable to raise more capital to fund its money-losing operations. The bursting of the dot-com bubble wiped out more equity – much of it held by individuals because so many dot-com companies had gone public – than debt. But the unpaid debt damaged lenders and other institutions. For example, WorldCom’s $41 billion bankruptcy and Global Crossing’s $12.4 billion collapse resulted from debt service way in excess of their money losing operations’ ability to repay. During the telecom boom, companies laid 80 million miles of fiber optic cable – between 85% and 95% of which remained unused years after the crash, The Bubble Bubble reported. Today’s GenAI boom could wipe out a significant amount of privately held equity value. While it does not appear a peak has been reached, the debt taken on to finance the building of AI data centers is expected to be even larger than it was during the dot-com boom. Major tech companies pledged a record $320 billion in capital expenditures for 2025, Fortune wrote. That number is growing so much that capex is forecast to reach $2 trillion by 2028 – a whopping $1.5 trillion of which will come from various forms of debt, according to Morgan Stanley. Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft generate massive cash flows. But the growth in debt to build AI data centers highlights the strain on their internal resources. The Morgan Stanley report suggests external financing, including high-cost private credit deals, is necessary to supplement their free cash flow. Investors should note Oracle’s recent experience: the company is already losing $100 million quarterly on its data center rentals to OpenAI noted AInvest despite signing a $300 billion, five-year deal, as I wrote in a September Forbes post. By the end of fiscal 2028, Oracle is forecast to burn nearly $29 billion in free cash flow, noted a Visible Alpha report featured by the Wall Street Journal. If Oracle — a relatively disciplined operator— can’t make AI infrastructure profitable, who can? The most alarming parallel to 2000 involves circular financing arrangements in which a company finances its customer’s purchases. Nvidia, Microsoft and others are now engaging in this practice. Here are five examples: These circular deals are not enough to satisfy OpenAI’s ambition. The company aims to build 250 gigawatts of new computing capacity by 2033 with a price tag exceeding $10 trillion, noted Bloomberg. What if enterprises – which are consuming much of the data center capacity being built to train and operate AI chatbots – decide they are wasting their money? With 95% of AI pilot projects failing to yield meaningful results, according to MIT NANDA, that absence of a return on their $40 billion investment could come soon if a recession is near. What could trigger a bursting of the AI boom? OpenAI needs to reach $125 billion in revenue just to break even—a target not expected until 2029, Reuters reported. Until then, the ChatGPT provider must finance its losses by raising capital. A loss of confidence in the industry’s ability to borrow money to build more AI data centers could send investors scrambling for the exits. However, given the small number of publicly-traded AI chatbot providers, it is difficult to envision another article like Willoughby’s March 2000 “Burning Up” – which was based on dozens of public companies likely to burn through their cash. Differences between today and 2000 may make a GenAI crash less severe. Unlike the dot-com era’s 2,288 IPOs, noted International Banker, many of today’s AI companies remain private. More than 300 enterprise software unicorns are trapped without exits. Their median age is “11.5 years, and 50% need to raise or exit within 12 months,” wrote SaaStr. The relatively small number of GenAI IPOs could limit the damage of a crash. In 2000, retail investors were borrowing money to bet on publicly-traded Internet companies which collapsed after they burned through their cash. Retail investors’ losses spread the dot-com collapse’s pain more widely. If recently public GenAI companies – such as CoreWeave or SoundHound -- were to implode, the relatively small number of GenAI IPOs might cause less damage to retail investors than did the dot-com bust. Another thing that’s better about today is the high profitability of many of the tech giants betting on AI. Today, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 contribute 28.8% of total earnings – a big jump from 2000’s 16.1%, reported Fortune. Investors should prepare for three scenarios: To get a sense of which scenario is most likely, investors should monitor these indicators: When today’s equivalent of Willoughy’s Barron’s article appears — providing specific data on which companies will run out of cash when — the psychological foundation will crack. The question is not if such a moment comes, but when, and whether the AI boom’s stronger fundamentals can cushion the fall that the dot-com boom’s relative lack of substance made inevitable.

I got the call a little before 5 p.m. on a Friday. My wife, Sima, and I were sitting on the couch with our kids, probably watching Curious George. The White House vetting process had gone on for months. Yet, despite the Zooms and document requests and endless online forms, I had a strange certainty that I ultimately would not be selected. “You’ve said … a lot of stuff,” observed the twentysomething staffer who got my file. The end of the day Friday is when Washington takes out the trash. It’s when you push out the bad news so it’s old news by Monday’s news cycle. So when the call came in, I looked at my phone, looked at Sima, and dismissively said as I stood to take the call something like: “Ah. This is the White House saying they’re not picking me.” Indeed, until the precise moment the words came out of the phone—“President Biden is going to nominate you to the Federal Trade Commission on Monday”—I remained convinced it was never going to happen. But it did. By that point, in September 2021, I’d spent most of my career working for two causes: privacy and immigrant rights. I stood up the Senate privacy subcommittee for Senator Al Franken and organized oversight hearings into Google and Apple and Facebook and the National Security Agency. I started the D.C. area’s first college scholarship that was blind to immigration status. As a law professor, I built a team that figured out how Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, finds people it wants to deport by pooling and mining their gas, water, and electric bills. I also served on the board of CASA, an extraordinary immigrant rights group that calls Kilmar Ábrego García a dues-paying member. I denounced the Trump administration’s decision to separate parents from their children at the border. I called ICE an “out of control domestic surveillance agency.” I even called the president a racist on social media. I got confirmed by the skin of my crooked teeth. It didn’t matter that I had deep experience on privacy—a core issue in the FTC’s consumer protection work. No Republican voted for me in the Senate Commerce Committee. No Republican voted for me on the floor of the Senate either. Vice President Kamala Harris had to travel to the Capitol to cast a tie-breaking vote in my favor—three times. One Republican senator told me why. We’d just had a long conversation about what social media was doing to teenagers’ mental health, and what I wanted to do about it. “I like you,” he said. “I look forward to working with you. But I can’t vote for you because of what you said about the president.” I came into office an unabashed advocate for immigrants. I left office the same way. But while that hasn’t changed, after three years as a commissioner, the way I look at the world has. I used to think that the defining fight for our country was between the left and the right. Now, I am much more worried about the money at the top crushing everyone underneath. That sounds grim because it is. But I also think this perspective can unite our country in a way that feels almost impossible today. When you are confirmed to the FTC, after you get your badge and keys and figure out your computer, the conference invitations start chiming in your inbox: Aspen, Brussels, Vegas, Davos. I declined those invites. My first trip was to Charleston, West Virginia. I had spent a lot of time during my confirmation process trying to teach myself about the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the way it affected pharmacies in rural and urban America. Along the way, I spent some time on the phone with Lynne Fruth, the second-generation owner of an independent pharmacy chain in Appalachia. She told me about how insurance companies were using intermediaries called “pharmacy benefit managers” to systematically steer lucrative prescriptions to their own mail-order pharmacies—not the ones that were convenient for their patients. I later read a West Virginia state insurance commissioner’s report about a family who had almost been turned away from a local pharmacy. Their child was sick with cancer. The pharmacy had the right medicine in stock. But an insurance company middleman told them to go home and wait up to two weeks for the medicine to arrive in the mail. So one night, after feeding the kids dinner, I got in my car and drove out to meet Fruth. As I left my house in Rockville, I turned on a podcast whose sole purpose was to explain the acronym soup of pharmaceutical pricing: “WAC,” “MAC,” “NADAC.” It got me well past Harper’s Ferry—more than an hour away. The next morning, in an office park just outside of Charleston, a roomful of independent pharmacists told me about the bizarre “negotiations” with those middlemen. Any wins were made on the phone. But the middlemen could undo those concessions at any time via fax. The pharmacists described being “audited” by those middlemen. Somehow, they were always fined by those same middlemen for noncompliance. And now, drug reimbursements from those insurers were going through the floor. In the pandemic, those independent pharmacists had vaccinated thousands of people, often in the poorest and most isolated areas unserved by national pharmacy chains. Their customers had heard all sorts of things about the vaccine online or on television. But they trusted their local pharmacists. Now, those independent pharmacies were closing, one after another. One pharmacist said, with a sad laugh, that he had started selling Jack Daniel’s just to keep the lights on. Toward the end of our session, a retired accountant named Jim Rossi started to speak. He had joined the meeting at Fruth’s request. He ticked through his daily routine of 15 pills for nine medicines treating three autoimmune disorders and a heart condition that required a pacemaker. He then told me what it was like to get all that via mail-order pharmacy. “It takes about a week to resolve any kind of a small issue with them,” he said. “Then, it takes them another week to fill the prescription. Then after that additional week wait, they ship the medication to me.” That took another three days to a week. His specialist had warned him to stick with the same manufacturer for each prescription. That’s not what came in the mail. “I open up the bottle, and there are three different colors of pills in it, which tells me there’s three different manufacturers in that bottle.” But there was one drug, for his Crohn’s disease, that the mail-order pharmacy filled unfailingly fast and in advance. He sometimes had a nine-month supply in a drawer at home. That one cost $1,000 a month. My second trip on the job was to Des Moines, where I met with nine corn growers and cattlemen in a hotel conference room on the sidelines of a law enforcement conference. The session was organized by my adviser, Max Miller, who had just left a job as an Iowa assistant attorney general to join my staff. This was the meat and potatoes of Max’s practice. I felt out of place in a suit and an N-95 mask. That went away when they started talking. Every person described a situation in which corporate power was squeezing them. They used to have any number of vendors to buy their seeds from; now there were two. The suppliers of all their inputs—feed, fertilizer, pesticides, you name it—had slowly consolidated and were jacking up prices. The ag industry was known for relentless innovation. “We doubled our yields in a generation,” the farmers said. But now, the companies weren’t focused on research and development. “They’re using their wealth to buy their competitors,” they said. The ranchers used to have any number of places to process their cattle. Now, a lot of them had just one meatpacking plant accessible to them. When you have just one place to sell your livestock, no one competes to buy it. What the processor pays is what you get. They used to fix their own tractors. Now, John Deere locked down its software, forcing them to take those tractors to a company dealership. “It’s like getting picked apart by a chicken,” said one of them. Said another: “We have a noose around our necks, and we’re standing on an ice cube.” But the problem went beyond income. When there’s just one processor, you have to get to that processor regardless of how far it is. Cattle die in the heat of the drive. And when that processor closes—as many did during Covid—there’s nowhere else to take your livestock. One rancher had to gas his hogs, dig ditches, and hire high schoolers “to fill holes with dead hogs.” Another rancher told me about how his one processor treated his animals. A cow had slipped upon arrival at the lot. She was injured and could not regain her footing. The rancher begged staff to let him take her home to heal, but that request was denied. No livestock could leave the premises. She was attached to a log chain, dragged out of the trailer, killed with a bolt to the head, and thrown in a dumpster. One of the last places I visited as a commissioner was a community center in a small park in Miami’s Little Havana. It was after sunset in early April, but it was already 80 degrees and muggy. Amid the sounds of creaking swings and little kids cutting their bikes through the playground, a dozen men trickled into the room after finishing construction and landscaping shifts in the Miami region, home to Jeff Bezos, billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin, and over a hundred centimillionaires. Most of them were in their twenties and thirties. They wore baseball caps and crisp T-shirts. They looked like they had gone home, showered, and walked into the room a few moments later. They were tired. I expected their main problem to be that they didn’t get unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation, or overtime. And I was right to a point. They didn’t. Even though they showed up at work and did what they were told, how they were told, and when they were told to do it, their bosses deemed them “independent contractors”—independent business owners, not W-2 employees. (I later heard an interview with an organizer who said he met workers who didn’t even know what overtime was—they’d never heard of it. “No saben que cosa es ‘overtime,’” he said.) But that wasn’t their main complaint. Their main complaint was that they didn’t get water. I did not expect that. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s filled with water that’s not potable,” said an organizer from WeCount!, the group that called the meeting. “Maybe there’s a thermos that’s covered in mold.” One of the men worked for hours in over 100-degree heat while staring at a cooler—his only source of bottled water. The cooler was locked. The prior year, a 47-year-old worker had died while remodeling a multimillion-dollar home in Coral Gables. The heat index was 104. A Tampa Bay Times investigation found that 37 outdoor workers died from heat-related causes in Florida over the past decade, “some just hundreds of feet from air conditioning and running water.” Federal safety inspectors were nowhere to be found. “There’s no water. There’s no harness training. We’ll go a month without the most minimum contact with OSHA”—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration—said a painter named Ronny. What if he complained to his employer? Most of the workers were undocumented, Ronny explained. “When you ask for the law, you lose your job.” So, the workers had gone to the county commission, and they succeeded in securing the passage of a law mandating water breaks for local construction sites. Six days after we met, Republican Governor Ron DeSantis blocked the ordinance. My second-to-last trip was to New York City, where I met with rideshare drivers gathered in a lecture hall at Fordham Law School near Lincoln Center. There were about 20 or 25 of them. They described being lured by promises of lucrative earnings accompanied by near-total control of their schedules. Many of them invested tens of thousands of dollars in new vehicles so they could get the best fares. A lot of them had a good experience; some had had it good for years. But recently, the apps started locking them out at seemingly random times of day. The first driver I heard from was named Mohamed Mohamed. He had maintained a five-star rating and a 100 percent acceptance rate over 21,000 rides and nine years of driving. At the start, he liked that the companies called him a “partner.” “You’re a partner for us,” he recalled them telling him. Now, “I take three trips, I stop to go to the bathroom, and I’m locked out for the end of the day,” he said. He was in $2,000 of credit card debt. And he now had to drive 12 hours to earn what he previously earned in four. Then another driver sat down to speak. I didn’t catch his name; I noticed he was shaking. His wife had died unexpectedly that morning. But he had been inexplicably kicked off the apps altogether with no explanation. He showed up anyway, because someone in government was finally going to listen to him. “This is not fair,” he yelled. “And I need the account back on to go to work. Because the city provided me a license to work, to be a good citizen. I am.” He was crying. “I do everything. Pandemic, I work. Snow, I work. Why I cannot live like a decent people?” The despair in this country is far deeper than most of us understand. It’s worse than that, actually: It’s so pervasive that we don’t even see it. It’s become normal. In the wealthiest country on Earth, it’s normal for people who are diagnosed with cancer to set up a web page to beg their friends and family for money. It’s normal for those people to go bankrupt. Getting sick is the most normal reason to go bankrupt. In a country that celebrates farmers, it’s normal for those farmers to kill themselves at a rate far beyond the rest of the population. At a time when billionaires compete to launch rockets into space, it’s normal—completely normal—for construction workers to die of heat and thirst. Many liberals remain baffled that America elected Donald Trump. They genuinely have no idea how he could have won the election. I don’t think that Trump won because of “wokeism” or the “trans agenda,” whatever that is. I think he won by speaking to that despair and telling people that he alone could fix it. His tirades against China and “illegals”? Some people listened to them and heard bigotry and xenophobia. I heard it, too. But more people heard a guy talking about how he was going to help them make rent. At least enough people to win the election. My time as a commissioner changed the way I saw things. I always suspected that despite Trump’s promises to cap credit card fees and slash prices and bring manufacturing back home, all of it would more or less amount to nothing. So far, other than temporarily reducing taxes on tips, that’s pretty much what’s happened. Instead, we face looming health care and childcare cuts for millions, a slowdown in manufacturing, and on-again-off-again tariffs indexed to whether a country will nominate Donald Trump for a Nobel Prize. Chaos and cruelty don’t pay the rent. But I expected all that. What I did not expect was that over time, people I’d seen as bold progressives started to look quite different. I always thought of Colorado Governor Jared Polis as a pathbreaker: the first openly gay man and first Jewish person elected governor in the state. Now, all I can think about is how he vetoed a law that would make it dramatically easier for people in Colorado to form a union … and a law that would have barred landlords from using algorithms to collude on rent hikes … and a law, passed unanimously in the state legislature, to end surprise ambulance bills … in two weeks. I always liked how Illinois Governor JB Pritzker stood up for the little guy: for undocumented people, for trans kids. I love how he seems genuinely unafraid of this president. But it’s harder to see him in the same light after watching him veto a bill that would have protected workers at Amazon warehouses—where injuries are so frequent that the company puts vending machines on its warehouse floors that dispense not potato chips, but painkillers. Why can’t Pritzker fight for the people in warehousing? Perhaps my biggest change is in how I think about what’s happening with ICE. The masked police, the flash renditions, the swamp gulag—we now live in the dystopia that we were loudly warned about during the president’s first term. But when I see police tackle a teenager with a baby’s teething toy in her hand, when I see them peel a child off of her dad’s arm at the courthouse, or cuff a shrieking mother saying she needs to get her kids from school, my first thought is not to “immigrant rights.” No. Now, I can’t stop thinking about the lawyer in a hand-stitched suit sitting at my old FTC conference table, telling me, over 70 minutes and a 30-page PowerPoint, how it could not possibly be in the interest of the United States government to sue her corporate client. And I’m not talking about one particular case; I’m talking about all of them. When the federal government does things like investigate a corporate landlord for packing rent checks with fake charges, or an oil executive allegedly trying to “align U.S. oil production with OPEC,” or pharmacy middlemen accused of trying to raise the price of insulin—it’s sternly worded letters, PDF white papers, and multiple hour-long meetings where the company gets to tell us what we got wrong. That’s standard process. But when you’re a cleaning lady whose papers aren’t right? It’s five men in bulletproof vests on your doorstep, and your four-year-old crumpled in your arms begging “no quiero please, please, please.” It’s an agent saying, “I’m sorry, but I don’t have any choice.” And that difference enrages me. Soon after taking office, Trump’s designated chairman of the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, announced that the agency would “usher in a new Golden Age for American businesses, workers, and consumers.” What has followed has been a Golden Age for the C-suite. The ban on noncompete clauses that keep everyone from pediatric surgeons to Jimmy John’s sandwich-makers in dead-end positions, or keep them from working entirely? Not worth defending in court. The rule banning companies from doing that thing where they sign you up for a subscription online, but only let you unsubscribe over the phone? Enforcement delayed to mid-July to give companies “ample time” to comply … and the federal court a window to strike it down. The order barring that oil executive from the board of Exxon? Undone. He’s free and clear to join. A similar scene unfolded 10 blocks west at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bank that was systematically hitting service members with surprise overdraft fees and forced to send them $80 million in refunds? Don’t have to pay them back anymore. The lawsuit against a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that allegedly tricked people into taking out loans for mobile homes when they had $57.78 in discretionary income? Gone. As everyone knows, these are just the lowlights. What people may not know is how thoroughly unprepared we are for this reality. Picture the inauguration. If the president tries to illegally deport you or illegally strip you of your voting rights or (ahem) illegally fire you, there are dozens of nonprofits that can step up to defend you in court, free of cost. Many struggle to make payroll. Some have tens of millions of dollars in the bank. The American Civil Liberties Union has $829 million. But what if the billionaires over the president’s shoulder hurt you? If they use legal loopholes to deny you health care? If they dock or block your pay for no apparent reason? If they buy all of your buyers so that only they buy your goods, and they set the price? If they use their market power not to outcompete you, but to bully you out of the market? There are maybe a handful of national nonprofit organizations that will represent you pro bono. And the ACLU fights the government, not the oligarchs. This all-encompassing focus on fighting government overreach may have made sense when our tax system actually taxed the rich, when union membership was at an all-time high, and when CEO earnings were not a vulgarity. Now, Fortune 500 firms regularly pay zero dollars in taxes. Unions protect just one in 10 workers. And CEOs parade like modern-day Roman emperors, in private jets, to private islands, with their private Praetorian firefighters and guards. And all of this is happening when the government agencies built to check corporate power are being torn apart. My daughter likes me to watch her gymnastics class. Let me try that again. My daughter really doesn’t like it when I stare at my phone during her gymnastics class. She has her mother’s strength. So when she makes it around the uneven bars a little faster than her peers, the first thing she does is shoot me a look. If I’m looking at my phone, that’s a big “L” for dad. And so, on a Tuesday this March, when I got a call a few moments after arriving at the gym from my colleague, Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, asking, “Hey, have you checked your email?”—I proudly said I had not! “Well, I just got an email from the White House saying they were firing me. You should probably check yours.” Sure enough, I had an email from someone named Trent Morse informing me that the president was firing me, effective immediately. Curiously, Morse did not claim I had neglected my duties or misused my authority; he went out of his way to not give a reason for the firing. That was a problem—for them. Because the Supreme Court had said, 90 years earlier, that the president could only remove an FTC commissioner “for cause.” The court said that unanimously. Suddenly, we had to answer a really weird question really quickly: If the president says you’re fired, but the Supreme Court says he can’t fire you, did you get fired? Or did you not get fired? Becca and I decided we did not get fired. We would keep doing our jobs. We’d keep on taking meetings, issuing statements, testifying before Congress. And we thought we should be loud about it. I called Sima, and my chief of staff. Then I put out a statement saying that the president was trying to turn the FTC, a fierce corporate watchdog, into “a lapdog for his golfing buddies.” The calls started. The New York Times, Bloomberg, a producer for Chris Hayes. My daughter got out of class, and I told her I’d been fired. She gave me a hug, got in the car, and asked if she could watch her favorite Lego builder on YouTube. FTC staff started calling. Then, more reporters. Ten minutes into the drive home, a little voice in the back seat piped up, “Papa, why are we going this way?” I was missing turns from the notifications on my screen, then missing more turns when my phone, which kept on dinging, was slow to update the map. When we finally got home, I recorded a video to explain how this wasn’t about hurting me, but about helping the men at the inauguration—Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Pichai. Between the two of us, Becca and I had sued, or were actively suing, each of the men’s companies. And we were weeks from a federal trial against Meta. We did a virtual press conference with some senators and congressmen; I did more interviews after that. A little before midnight, there was a knock at our door. Domino’s. It was my first break since 5 p.m., and I was grateful for what I thought was a gesture from a friend who knew I’d be up late. I opened the box: meat lover’s, loaded with bacon. We don’t do bacon. I asked the delivery guy if he’d gotten a tip—he said no—so I started trying to find an app to pay him, when he spoke up to say, “Well, ah, sir, you still haven’t paid for the pizza.” That’s when we realized that the pizza was not from a friend. It was from someone, somewhere, telling me they knew where I lived. The days and weeks ping-ponged between the thrill of being able to publicly denounce what was happening to our agency—and the dull fear a parent feels when things are not right for their family. I hold virtual roundtables with rideshare drivers in Denver, fishermen from Maine, and small retailers in Massachusetts—someone tries to take out a half-million-dollar line of credit in my name. I speak at the Bernie and AOC rally in Denver; I scream so loud I pull a muscle in my neck. I realize we can’t buy a house on a single income, even though we’d been planning a move for months. Commissioner Slaughter and I quickly sued to block the attempt to remove us. The financial ramifications of the legal fight started to set in. Sima and I looked at our accounts and figured we could afford about three months for it to play out. The three-month mark approached with no ruling from the judge. So I decided to call the guys in Iowa. My very last visit as a commissioner was to a family farm in Ankeny, just north of Des Moines. It was scheduled for a Saturday morning in June. Going in, I knew that by Monday, unless I woke up to a ruling reinstating me, I’d issue a statement formally resigning as a commissioner, letting me start to look for a new job. Max, my former adviser, put me up at his house the night before. We woke up and went to the farmer’s market with his new wife and their now five kids. I got a coffee and a kielbasa. We drove up to Ankeny. The Iowa Farmers Union had organized a listening session at a fifth-generation diversified farm that grew corn, soybeans, oats, and alfalfa, along with a range of livestock. The owner, LaVon Griffieon, had attended that first meeting; so had a few others in the audience. This time, I was able to talk about our lawsuit against two pesticides manufacturers that were trying to push cheaper generics off the market, as well as about our lawsuit, filed just that January, against John Deere for locking down its software. The group was kind to me. They appreciated it, they said. But so many of their stories were the same that they were three years earlier. A corn and soybean grower said that fertilizer prices were moving in lockstep, such that the moment the farmers finally saw some profit, prices would go up and erase those profits. “Iowans like to claim they feed the world,” said Griffieon. “But the pandemic proved to us with bare store shelves that Iowa can’t even feed Iowa very easily.” A half-hour in, there was a speaker I hadn’t met—a tall, young farmer with long hair, also fifth-generation, named Sean Dengler. On the first day of the winter harvest, he had gotten up and turned on the combine. It roared, then whimpered, then went into “limp mode.” The circuit board was fried, and only John Deere could fix it. Sean’s father called the dealership right away, but the technician took hours to get there. A line of other farmers had called in first. The soybeans were already dry, and it was hot and windy. So they paid extra for the part to be delivered the next day; and again paid extra for the second visit. “We lost time waiting, which meant lost yield potential,” he said. “And we lost money because John Deere could charge us more because that is their business plan.” Our lawsuit was a few months too late. It was Sean’s last harvest. “Both of my grandparents were farmers,” he said. “I’m the last Dengler to ever farm in Tama County.” The session lasted another hour. I had lunch at a Mexican restaurant with the union president, his vice president, an ag reporter, and Josh Manske, a board member from Algona, Iowa. The lunch lasted about an hour. And that was it. I was done. Josh and I met Max in a park back in Des Moines, got some beers, and found an empty picnic table. We talked about Max’s blended family. I thanked Josh for hosting a liminal FTC commissioner. We laughed about that. We talked about the session. While a lot of things had come up, I kept coming back to Sean Dengler. Then, I thought about those rideshare drivers in New York City. It may not look this way at first, but the Iowa farmer who can’t run his combine because of a farm equipment monopoly has a heck of a lot in common with the Bangladeshi dad who can’t work the morning commute because he’s locked out by Uber and Lyft. If you focus on the conflict between left and right, if the most important thing is what you are—your party, your state, your race, your ethnicity—the people I met could not be more different. On the one hand, you have rural, white small-business owners, generations into building a life in this country. On the other, you have urban Latino, Haitian, African, and South Asian immigrants, every one of them a worker. The line between them is sharp, almost tribal. What could they possibly have in common? Everything—if you look at what they need. The people I met as a commissioner may look different, but what they need is surprisingly the same: They need a government that gives them a level playing field against the powerful and wealthy. They need the courts to check corporations when they abuse that power and wealth. They need basic dignity and control in their material lives. Looking at things that way, everyone I met was part of one huge group: people working themselves to the bone who were getting screwed by billionaires and corporations—regardless of party or state or race or ethnicity. Regardless, even, of whether they are workers or the owners of farms or small businesses. Populism is not an indictment, but an opportunity. Focusing on the conflict between the haves and the have-nots is not divisive; it’s a way to build coalitions with astonishing potential. Our nation’s first antitrust law was passed at the demand of small farmers bled dry by the railroads and grain elevators. But when Ohio’s John Sherman stood on the floor of the Senate to call for its passage in 1890, he didn’t just do it for the Grangers. He also talked about labor. The trust “commands the price of labor without fear of strikes,” he declared, “for in its field it allows no competitors.” When the law was abused to crack down on strikers, Samuel Gompers mobilized the American Federation of Labor and won corrections in the 1914 Clayton Act to try to guarantee them that right, while tightening other loopholes that John Rockefeller and the other robber barons had exploited. Gompers called the law a “Magna Carta for labor.” Then in 1936, small-town grocers came in to press for and win a separate law to stop the incipient A&P grocery chain—ancestor of the modern big-box stores—from cutting secret deals with their suppliers that slashed prices for A&P while marking them up for the little guys. Our anti-monopoly laws exist because of the work of farmers, labor unions, and country grocers. If that seems like an unlikely bunch, consider that Minnesota still does not have a “Democratic” party, but rather a Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, because of a resurgence of that coalition 30 years after the Sherman Act. Consider that the pharmacy deserts in Appalachia are caused by the same ruthless middlemen who create those deserts in Philadelphia. I know, because a session I had with the Philadelphia pharmacists was nearly identical to one I’d had in Charleston. The same goes for independent grocers. The people in Pine Ridge, South Dakota, live in an incipient food desert for the same reason that the people of downtown North Tulsa do: The government stopped enforcing the 1936 law (it was called the Robinson-Patman Act). And when we start enforcing it again, poor people in small towns and big cities—people told every day that they have nothing in common—will benefit in equal measure. I feel the potential for those fights anytime I hear how some conservatives talk about the tenure of Lina Khan, whom I served alongside when she was chair of the Federal Trade Commission. I felt it when I talked to people about my job. I had a favorite kind of conversation as a commissioner. I had some version of it at least three or four times. It was when a MAGA conservative asked me—a certified “left-wing activist,” “provocateur,” “bomb-thrower,” and “extremist”—to quote my friend Ted Cruz: What exactly is it you do in government? I would tell anyone who asked that I was investigating the pharmacy middlemen who were shutting down independent pharmacies across rural and urban America. I’d tell them I was suing Amazon for screwing over small retailers. I’d tell them I was making sure that the biggest grocery store in town doesn’t buy the next biggest grocery store in town—which will make eggs even more expensive and union negotiations even harder. I’d tell them I was trying to let gig workers organize so that Uber and Lyft and DoorDash couldn’t lie to them or cheat them out of their pay. I’d tell them I was suing landlords who pack rent bills with hidden fees. I definitely told them that we were trying to end that horrible thing where you sign up for something online but can only cancel on the phone before 4 p.m., after 45 minutes on hold. And usually, by that point, the conversation had changed. Their suspicion had turned into cautious interest, maybe even excitement. Undocumented people have become the new American underclass: good enough to pick our crops, bus our tables, and build our buildings—not good enough for us to protect their life or liberty, let alone their pursuit of happiness. There are many reasons for this. Some are legal. A lot of it is anger. I understand where some of the anger comes from. Take the construction industry. A generation of working-class kids grew up watching their dads provide for their families by working construction. They were hard jobs, but they were good ones. You could buy a house, send your kid to college, maybe even buy a boat for the weekends. Now, those jobs pay a fraction of what they used to. And those kids are now adults, voting adults, and they see those jobs occupied by men from Central and South America, many of whom are undocumented. What would it look like to confront undocumented immigration not as a left-right issue, but as a conflict between billionaires and working people? Maybe we focus less on the tension between undocumented people and the native-born workers that they seem to displace. Maybe we focus more on the billionaire developers who pretended that the people they hired were “independent contractors,” turning what used to be middle-class jobs into subsistence work, while also making it easier to hire and exploit undocumented laborers. Maybe we ask ourselves: Who gets rich from that? Is it the guy working in 100-degree heat with no water? Or is it the guy downing a steak while toasting his new development? Maybe we try to become skeptical of the idea that the least powerful people are the most responsible for our problems. Maybe we punch up instead of punching the neighbor. Nowadays, I think a lot about what’s happened to Ábrego García. The media has rightly focused on the outpouring of support for an apprentice sheet metal worker and his young family in Beltsville, Maryland. They are right to focus on the courthouse protests. They made a difference. But I have been moved by a different scene, which occurred in early April in a Washington, D.C., conference hall filled with electricians, ironworkers, and other tradespeople, members of the North America’s Building Trades Unions, where Ábrego García’s union is an affiliate. In this scene, NABTU president Sean McGarvey stands in front of his members, and says: We need to make our voices heard. We’re not red, we’re not blue. We’re the building trades, the backbone of America. You want to build a $5 billion data center? Want more six-figure careers with health care, retirement, and no college debt? You don’t call Elon Musk. You call us! [...] And yeah, that means all of us—all of us! Including our brother, SMART apprentice Kilmar Ábrego García, who we demand to be returned to us and his family now. He slams his fist on the podium. “Bring him home!” he shouts, as the audience gets out of their seats for a standing ovation. And that, to me, feels like the future. Alvaro M. Bedoya served as a federal trade commissioner from 2022 until President Trump fired him in March.

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), SaaStr.Ai So there has never been a “start-up” like OpenAI. Already with 800,000,000+ users and a breathtaking $500 Billion (!) valuation. But it’s also raised and spent epic amounts. So as the chart from FT below shows — all the historic investors together, as a group, will likely own 10% after the company converts to a for-profit. All of them. From Khosla to Thrive to Founders Fund and more. OpenAI has now raised approximately $58 billion in primary funding across 11 rounds, with an additional $6.6 billion secondary sale in October 2025 at the $500 billion valuation. But the cash burn? That’s where it gets interesting. The company now projects it will burn $115 billion through 2029—that’s $80 billion higher than previously expected. Let that sink in. Not $115 billion raised. $115 billion burned. Breaking it down: This isn’t mismanagement. This is the cost of competing in frontier AI. The numbers are staggering: A 17x increase in less than three years. But when you’ve raised $58 billion and are burning over $100 billion to get there, the ownership math tells a different story. Looking at the projected ownership post-restructure (per FT Research and other sources): For founders and early investors who weren’t Microsoft, the dilution has been severe. Eight of the eleven original co-founders have left. Early VCs who got in at sub-$30 billion valuations have seen their ownership percentages compressed dramatically—even as the absolute dollar value has grown. The cap table now includes 11 funding rounds. What makes OpenAI’s story unique is who’s investing and why: Microsoft isn’t just an investor—they’re existentially dependent on OpenAI. Their entire AI strategy—Azure growth, Office Copilots, enterprise AI positioning—runs through OpenAI infrastructure. They’ll keep funding to protect that relationship. But they also receive ~20% of OpenAI’s revenue through their partnership agreement, creating a circular funding dynamic. Nvidia invested $100 million in October 2024 and gets paid back immediately through GPU purchases. They’ve invested in 50+ AI startups creating a circular economy where investment dollars flow back as compute revenue. Part of Microsoft’s and Nvidia’s investment effectively returns to their own coffers. SoftBank went from a $500 million investor in October 2024 to leading a $30 billion round six months later. That’s not normal venture behavior—that’s Masayoshi Son making a macro bet on AGI. Their commitment is so aggressive that if OpenAI doesn’t complete its for-profit conversion by December 31, 2025, SoftBank’s investment could be slashed from $30 billion to as low as $20 billion. Traditional VCs are playing a different game: raising larger funds on the AI narrative, marking up valuations in subsequent rounds, and hoping an exit materializes. But with 60+ investors on the cap table, exit dynamics will be complicated. Honestly it’s kind of based that employees will own 3x as much of OpenAI as VCs https://t.co/7MoOk6L8A1 — Luke Metro (@luke_metro) October 14, 2025 The October 2025 secondary sale is particularly revealing. OpenAI had authorized up to $10.3 billion in shares for sale but only about $6.6 billion ultimately changed hands. Why did employees sell less than authorized? Two possibilities: Either way, this was the second major secondary in a year—a clear signal that liquidity events are necessary to retain talent competing with Meta’s nine-figure offers and public company stock compensation. Here’s the structural complexity that matters: current investors still don’t own actual equity. They hold convertible notes that only convert to shares after the nonprofit-to-for-profit restructuring completes. This requires: The deadline? December 31, 2025. If the conversion fails, SoftBank’s investment drops from $30 billion to $20 billion, and other investors can demand their money back with 9% interest. That’s a potential $40+ billion liability. The OpenAI model isn’t replicable—but the dynamics are instructive: For AI infrastructure founders: If you’re building frontier models, you’re signing up for capital requirements that dwarf traditional SaaS. You’ll need to raise 4-5x your revenue run rate continuously. You might own 5-15% of something huge rather than 25% of something modest. And you’ll need to accept strategic investors who become customers, partners, and dependencies simultaneously. For AI application founders: The good news is you probably don’t need the OpenAI model. If you’re building on top of foundation models, your capital requirements are dramatically lower. But you’re also betting that OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider maintains reasonable API pricing as they burn billions. For investors: Traditional venture math is broken in frontier AI. A 10x return on a $500 billion valuation requires a $5 trillion outcome. You’re not investing for returns—you’re investing for: To be fair, the revenue growth is real: At a $500 billion valuation on $12.7 billion revenue, that’s roughly a 39x revenue multiple. For context, Salesforce trades at 8-9x, ServiceNow at 20x. But both are profitable. The bet is that by 2029, at $100 billion in revenue, a $500 billion valuation would be 5x revenue—reasonable for a high-growth software company. But that requires executing flawlessly for four years while burning $115 billion and fending off Google, Meta, Anthropic, and everyone else building AGI. Yes, OpenAI scaled to a $500 billion valuation faster than any company in history. Yes, they’re generating $12.7 billion in revenue with 500 million weekly users. Yes, they’ve created a new market category and changed how the world thinks about AI. But they’ve also: The valuation is spectacular. The dilution is equally spectacular. The capital requirements are unprecedented. The burn rate is staggering. All of these things are true simultaneously. This is the new reality of frontier AI. Not every hot AI deal will look like this, but many infrastructure plays will require similar capital intensity. The question isn’t whether you can raise at massive valuations—OpenAI proved you can. The question is whether the dilution, complexity, and burn make sense for your business model and your exit strategy. For most AI companies, the answer is no. For foundation model companies competing for AGI, it might be the only path forward.

Title: What’s Behind The 40% Rise In META Stock?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META’s stock has seen a solid 43% rise in the last six months. This growth is primarily fueled by a mix of factors, including upbeat quarterly performance and significant AI investments that boosted the core advertising business, leading to a rise in ad impressions and ad prices. Furthermore, rising user engagement across its apps contributed to investor optimism, all while the company returned capital to shareholders via $9.76 billion in share repurchases and $1.33 billion in dividend payments in Q2 alone. From a quantitative perspective, the 43% surge in Meta Platforms stock in the last six months was largely driven by a 33.5% change in the company's P/E Multiple. While there is more to this narrative than mere numbers, let's first dissect the stock price movement into its contributing factors. Investing in a single stock can be fraught with risk, but there is substantial benefit to a more diversified strategy, like the one we employ with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Additionally, think about the potential long-term performance for your portfolio if you integrated 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto alongside equities. Separately, see – What's Happening With RGTI Stock? Returning to the “change”: The alterations in fundamental aspects like valuation, revenue, and margins carry with them a narrative related to business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed significant developments that impacted the stock price movements for META stock. As a quick background: META offers products that allow users to connect and share through various devices, including mobile phones, PCs, VR headsets, wearables, and augmented reality, promoting connectivity anytime and anywhere. Opinion: Currently, we view META stock as fairly valued. Why is that the case? Take a look at the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell META Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: Nonetheless, META is not immune to significant declines. It dropped approximately 43% during the 2018 correction, 35% amid the Covid pandemic, and sustained a heavier blow of 77% during the inflation crisis. Despite all the positives surrounding the stock, real risks remain. When markets sour, META can still experience serious downturns. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor, particularly given the volatility linked to a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a proven record of surpassing the S&P 500 during the past 4-year period. Why is this the case? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a steadier performance, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Tim Ferriss at a Career Crossroads: How Should He Shape His Next Chapter?

Author, podcaster, and angel investor Tim Ferriss considers what to do next to meet his career and life goals. In April 2024, writer, podcaster, and entrepreneur Tim Ferriss—known for his hugely popular podcast “The Tim Ferriss Show” and NYT-bestselling books like The 4-Hour Workweek—found himself at a crossroads. Although his podcast was generating millions annually, he questioned the sustainability of podcasting and his own competitive advantage given the increasingly saturated market and the advent of AI tools and video-centric formats. Plus, he had built his career on anticipating cultural shifts in knowledge work, health, and media consumption while making early angel investments in companies like Uber, Shopify, Facebook, and Twitter. But his podcast’s reliable cash flow also funded his science-focused foundation, so making any shifts would be very consequential. He faced a difficult choice: innovate from within his proven format, pivot to entirely new ventures—possibly in film, premium consumer products, or venture capital—or risk a slow decline by maintaining the status quo. Complicating matters further was Ferriss’s desire to start a family, a goal he prioritized above all business ventures. Every month of indecision narrowed his window for successfully transitioning. Senior Lecturer Reza Satchu and Tim Ferriss joined Cold Call host Brian Kenny to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss: What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” in front of a live audience on October 7, 2025 in Harvard Business School’s Klarman Hall auditorium. Using “The Founder Mindset” framework from the course created by Satchu, they explore testing assumptions, calibrating risk, and how to choose the next path in the face of multiple options—which can often lead to inaction. BRIAN KENNY: Welcome to Cold Call, the podcast where we dive deep into the stories behind groundbreaking Harvard Business School case studies. Tim Ferriss has been called the Oprah of Audio. His podcast, the Tim Ferriss Show, surpassed a billion downloads and reshaped the digital media landscape. Yet at the height of his success, Ferriss found himself at a crossroads. With podcasting becoming a crowded competitive space, he wondered whether the medium that had defined his career was still the best vehicle for his curiosity, creativity, and impact. How should a creator who has always thrived by reinventing himself decide what’s next? Especially when personal priorities, like starting a family, collide with professional ambitions. Today, on Cold Call, I’m joined by Professor Reza Satchu and case protagonist Tim Ferriss to discuss the case, “Tim Ferriss, What Might This Look Like If It Were Easy?” I’m your host Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to a live taping of Cold Call coming to you from Klarman Hall on the campus of HBS, Harvard Business School. Make some noise, folks. All right, can we have a warm welcome for our guests? Reza Satchu teaches entrepreneurship at Harvard Business School, including the Founder Mindset and Founder Launch, both courses that he created. He is also a serial entrepreneur, having founded multiple highly successful ventures. Reza, welcome. REZA SATCHU: Thank you very much. Thanks for having us. BRIAN KENNY: Tim Ferriss, the subject of today’s case is a bestselling author, entrepreneur, speaker, and early stage investor. You may have heard that he hosts a podcast. Tim, welcome. TIM FERRISS: Thanks. Thanks for having me. Hi, everybody. BRIAN KENNY: It’s great to have you here. I’m a little nervous actually because your podcast gets a lot of listens, so I want to make sure that we do this right. TIM FERRISS: I’m sure you’ll be fine. You have a better voice for radio. We were both commenting, the intonation and delivery. I thought it was so good. I was like, man. BRIAN KENNY: Why don’t we just dive right in? Reza, I’m going to start with you. Can you tell us what drew you to Tim’s story? Why did you think it was a good subject for a case study, particularly for the Founder’s Mindset class, and what makes it particularly relevant for aspiring founders today? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so look, I think I was thrilled. Actually, my research associate who’s here, Denise Koller, came up with the idea of interviewing Tim. Initially, I thought, “Does this make sense?” The more I got to know Tim and study his work, his mindset is exactly in sync with some of the things that we’re trying to get our founders to think about, starting with, he imagines a world that doesn’t exist today. He imagines that there are things he can do that are different than are existing today. He imagines a space where he can actually think about something, take a series of actions, trust his judgment, and hopefully build something of consequence. So many people stop at that first point, which is, how could I possibly do something different? It started really there, where I thought, “Here’s someone who has done many different things well, trusted his judgment.” Really, that’s a key part of being a founder. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, let me turn to you the case. Like any good HBS case, it opens up with you thinking pensively about what you’re going to do. You’re probably staring out a window looking at something. I’m wondering, actually, if you can take us back to where the case opens up, where you’re mulling through what your options are. You’ve got a lot of options right now and you’re thinking about what the best thing is. What was going on, what was your mindset at that time? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I was actually literally looking out, in Austin where I recorded my podcast. I would say fundamentally it was, number one, has this become a crowded red ocean where other people can do this, what I started off doing in 2014. If there are one or more people who can do what I can do, I’m like, “Well, this seems redundant.” I would prefer to do something that is more of a category of one, to borrow from the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing. There wasn’t a financial pressure to stop. Certainly, there was a little bit of pressure to continue because it funds the foundation, it funds the angel investing, it pays for the bills and employees and so on. But it was more a question of, is this the game I want to play? We’re all playing games past a certain point, past the lowest rungs on Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. Then, beyond that, it’s being aware of what game you’ve currently opted into, what are the rules, what are the wind conditions, the failure modes. Then, authoring something that hopefully stacks the deck in your favor. That’s a lot of what I was thinking about. The entire landscape had become too saturated. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, and so you described this in the case as blue oceans versus red oceans. Reza, if you can talk about, in the Founder Mindset framework, how does Tim’s approach to pattern recognition and assumption testing compare to other founders? REZA SATCHU: I think there’s a critically important point on Tim’s mindset, and how I think it resonates with the Founder Mindset, is people think of committing to an idea as jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters, and that somehow being a founder is full of risk, full of uncertainty. You close your eyes and you just hope and pray for the best. Okay, I can’t tell you how flawed that is. I’m a serial founder. I will tell you I think about risk all the time. I calculate risk and I’m not paralyzed by it. The key is actually making decisions in the face of risk. What Tim does with what he calls these assumptions or these experiments, he effectively is trusting his judgment to do some things. Nothing terribly consequential, but enough to get data to figure out whether or not he should continue pursuing his curiosity. He gives himself permission to go down a pathway of his curiosity, whereas, most people never give themselves that permission because they just think, “How could I possibly have this idea when others have so many more resources?” I call it “small c commitments.” He calls it these “two-week experiments,” but it’s this idea that he’s willing to suspend disbelief that others haven’t thought of this idea, and that he’s willing to actually test his ideas and dip his toe in before he jumps in. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Tim, for you, a lot of this began back when you wrote The 4-Hour Work Week, was that 15 years ago, give or take? TIM FERRISS: Almost 20, 2007, back when I had hair. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, that book challenged a lot of assumptions at that time. I’m wondering what assumptions you were testing as you wrote that book, and how do you weigh the risks and opportunities of coming out with something that seems a little audacious? TIM FERRISS: The first part I would say is simply asking questions that address some of the assumptions underlying traditional, let’s just call it, or conventional career planning. The deferred life plan. What would you do if you could not do that? If you could not rely on that. Which by the way is more and more relevant with some of the technologies that are coming. But if you couldn’t rely on that, exactly, as a social contract, what would you do? Then, it just led into lots of my own experiments. That was largely autobiographical. Then, teasing out the principles that allowed me to automate, and at the time use virtual assistants, that would be replaced by a lot of AI right now. That’s the first part. It was testing assumptions, but not just in a theoretical capacity. It was saying, “All right, I tried this thing, it didn’t work. I did this, it did work. I did this, it kind of worked, and here’s how I got it to really work. Here’s how you might think about dipping your toe in the water.” One critical part of that book that I think sometimes gets missed is cultivating a bias towards action. There are these exercises at the end of almost every chapter called Comfort Challenges. It’s just doing things that are very uncomfortable socially. There’s really no risk involved. This is not from the book, but my friend Noah Kagan talks about the Coffee Challenge, where people have to go in, order a coffee, and then ask for 10% off without giving any explanation, and just like, deal with that. It’s amazing. You see these people are like multiple-time founders or HBS grads, they’re pacing. They’re like, “Oh, it’s easy.” They’re pacing around the coffee shop for 30 minutes trying to build up the courage to do it. It’s like, “Yeah, that stuff helps.” From realizing that most stumbles or non-issues to begin with. In terms of presenting something that was contrarian, I first of all pitched the book. It’s a long story as to how I even got to the book, because I never wanted to write a book, but it was turned down by something like 29 publishers, violently. Some of the rejection letters were worthy of framing. Then, Steve Ross and Heather Jackson, at Crown, which was an imprint of Random House at the time, my pitch had been polished after getting rejected 29 times, literally, this is not an exaggeration. They were like, “Sure, kid. We’ll pay you pennies on the dollar to try this.” Their downside risk was very low. I had, as a younger person, I was published when I was 29, but at that time it’s like, what are your advantages? You can take stock of your advantage. At that time, it’s time, it’s speed, experimentation. You don’t have some permanent record of strikes that follows you around everywhere. I think you can afford to experiment. For me, it was ultimately an exercise in writing a book, and the only time it started to click was when I basically wrote it as I would write an email to two very particular friends after two glasses of wine. I threw out two drafts of that book, and then it unfolded, and that bought me permission to do a lot of other things. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it worked out in the end, didn’t it? TIM FERRISS: It did work out. It’s not the end yet, so we’ll see. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I had a chance to sit in on your class today, which was really interesting, and thank you for letting me do that. You talked a lot about failure, particularly in the beginning part of the class. What’s the Founder’s Mindset where it comes to being able to get rejected 29 times and still go back and ask for another publishing deal? REZA SATCHU: Okay, so first of all, just on failure, I think human psychology, is you often overestimate your downside, and I think to Tim’s point, you also massively underestimate your ability to recover. People imagine failure as this terrible thing that, oh my God, if this happens, it will be awful. Certainly, sitting here with the HBS students, what you’re doing is looking left and right and wondering, “Oh, my God, these people are going to think I’m a failure.” When in reality they’re barely going to think about you at all, but people are really stressed about that. I think the broader component around failure is not only do you overestimate what failure is, but by not putting yourself in positions of failure, two things don’t happen. One is you don’t learn. You don’t learn what happens through that failure. But the second thing is, I don’t know if this is what happened here, but people actually, when they look at someone who has stayed committed 29 times, I have this phrase which is like, magic happens when you commit, which is it’s not just you learn what you’re capable of. Other people show up precisely because they see the commitment. What people often misprice is that piece of the right tail upside. I think failure is a wonderful thing. I think a life without failure is a terrible life. It’s just a life where you don’t learn what you’re capable of. I think there needs to be a fundamental reframing of failure. Tim, I’d love you to talk about your concept of these one-way doors, irreversible law, like how you price risk, what does risk actually mean to you? TIM FERRISS: Yeah, I can speak to that. I also want to add something I left out of the question around The 4-Hour Work Week. There we go. I’ll let you take it. Just because people are rejecting your idea does not mean it’s a good idea. Just to state the obvious. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. TIM FERRISS: I agree with Paul Graham, Co-Founder of Y Combinator, who wrote an essay roughly around, the more labels you apply to yourself, the dumber you are. If you pride yourself on being contrarian, you’re actually just conforming to an anti-consensus. You’re actually still suffering from a really heavy form of bias. In my case, the reason I persisted through those 29 rejections was that the material that was going to be in the book, I had workshopped with, I don’t know, a thousand students at Princeton doing guest lectures at the invitation of my former professor. I had refined it, refined it like a stand-up comedian working on his 60-minute set, and I knew it worked. REZA SATCHU: Right, so you had an informational advantage. TIM FERRISS: I asked for feedback forms after every class. I had all these annoying pointed questions that students didn’t want to fill out. I knew that for a particular demographic it worked, and that’s why I persisted. If I had not had that data, I don’t think I would’ve persisted. I wouldn’t have had any grounds for plowing head in that way. Then, in terms of risk, I think there’s a lot to be said. I’m echoing Scott Galloway here, but choosing where you’re going to live and operate actually is a really important, sometimes more so than what you’re going to do. Moving to Silicon Valley was incredibly liberating because people fail all the time and they’re never counted out. I’ve invested in so many founders who failed the first time and then, boom. REZA SATCHU: Back at it. TIM FERRISS: Right? StumbleUpon, I was an advisor, didn’t work out. That was a zero for me as an advisor. But then, Garrett Camp a few months later was like, “Hey, I have this idea.” Turned it into Uber. People are never counted out. Being in an environment where that is the case matters a lot. It doesn’t have to be Silicon Valley, although that’s the most obvious. Risk for me, put simply, would be the probability of an irreversible negative outcome. There are some cases where that’s part of the calculus, but typically, I thought about making a journal. I seriously contemplated doing this because everyone’s making a journal now, but I went to the bookstore, I was like, “There are too many journals, I’m not going to do it.” But the journal was going to be called “worries that mostly didn’t happen.” It’s just like you just write down what you’re worried about and then you look back three months later, and again, none of that actually mattered. The cost of “failure” is very low for most things. You can also get a signal, positive or negative, go or no-go, pretty quickly if you’re methodical about it. I try to view, reframe failure, as scientific feedback. You have a hypothesis, you test it, it didn’t pan out, still valuable. If you’re optimizing for learning and relationships that transcend any given project, experiment, company, job, et cetera, those things snowball over time. If you’re keen on doing short-term experiments but long-term greedy, it’s very hard to lose, in my opinion. From what I’ve seen, and this is based on Silicon Valley, so it’s maybe anomalous, but it’s really hard to fail over the long term. REZA SATCHU: The amazing thing about this failure point is if you just think about two different career trajectories, one is a more traditional career trajectory. Let’s pick on consultants because, why not? There’s no real risk of failure. You’re going to get 95 things out of a hundred right on that path. On the Founder path, you are getting most things wrong. You’re asking people for money, they’re saying no. You’re asking customers to transact with you, they’re saying no. You’re trying to hire people, they’re saying no. You’ve got no resources. You’re constantly surrounded by a life of failure. You’ve just got to decide which life sounds better. What you suddenly realize is, wow, well, a life without failure, it’s hard to imagine having the impact that you all want to have, or having the return that you all want to have. I really think this point around risk really ties into failure, which is first of all, you need to reframe risk as a really great thing. Without risk, there’s no return. Risk is a good thing. It is not what you immediately think of, which is, “Oh, I want to stay away from it.” You need risk. Okay? What that doesn’t mean is that you’re jumping off a cliff. What it means is you understand how to operate in terms of risk. You need to incorporate some of the frameworks that you’ve talked about in class today to measure and calibrate it. But Tim’s not writing these books if he’s not willing to encounter risk. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, the 4-Hour Body, still recovering from some injuries from that one, 2010. Just had a surgery on this elbow as a result of that book. REZA SATCHU: Everyone must have thought that was a crazy idea. TIM FERRISS: It was crazy. But to use the 4-Hour Body as an example, the 4-Hour Work Week bought me permission to experiment outside of that lane, and so I did the 4-Hour Body in totally different category. Because the upside of that was so high if it opened the door to me writing books on any subject. The downside was that book doesn’t do well, and I go back to milking this 4-Hour, whatever the hell work week. The downside risk was very, very limited. I would also say that I think my experience with great schools, my experience with analytical people in general, is that they’re very good at thinking about all the possible downsides of doing the new thing or doing the “risky thing”. But they don’t spend as much time thinking about the cost of inaction or the status quo or taking the safe route. If you telescope out six months, a year, three years, five years, what are the emotional costs, financial, maybe relational, et cetera. It turns out when you start to look at these two options with equal weight, that the potentially safer route is just as fraught with all sort of problems as the supposedly risky route. Then, it’s like, “All right, I might as well do the weird thing first.” BRIAN KENNY: Did you ever worry about your brand though, the Tim Ferriss brand? If I do something that’s too contrarian, I may lose some of my brand cachet. TIM FERRISS: I don’t think about brand really at all, which isn’t to fault anyone who does, but I think brand is one of those words that can be a siren song for lots of decisions that compromise. I don’t want to say necessarily integrity and values, although it can be that, but you can be captured by, in my case, like an audience who rewards you for your most outlandish comments. If you follow that incentive structure on something like YouTube, you can wear a mask for so long that you become that mask. I’ve seen that happen to people, and you can’t hit control Z on that very easily, so I don’t think about brand. I pay a lot of attention to truly following my curiosity. When I do say a six, I do these two week experiments, but they’re generally within the context of a six to 12-month project. When I’m in that six to 12-month project, I am all in. I am completely saturated in it. I just find that there are a lot of ways to approach this. There’s no one way for everybody, but most of the hiccups along the way are just little toe stubs. But you have to get used to taking the hits. In other words, it’s like, if you were to go to a boxing class and you’ve never done boxing before and you get hit in the liver with a punch, it’s not even a hard punch. It’s going to be really shocking and unpleasant. If you do it for six months, you’ll be like, “Okay, yeah, I’m going to get 50 of these today. It’s fine.” You get over it, but you have to train your immune response, your stress response to this stuff. The only way to do that is by getting out there and trying stuff. REZA SATCHU: Brian, this is what’s so valuable to Founders, is exactly this, which is what they’re getting is hit all the time, but they’re learning that they can recover much faster through those hits. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Could I add one more thing? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, of course. TIM FERRISS: I’ll give you an example. I remember the first time that I got, sadly, this is just a tax in the US, my first frivolous lawsuit, I got sued by somebody who was completely, it’s laughably ridiculous. I was so stressed out, I couldn’t sleep, and my publisher was involved, all this craziness. It was filed by the law firm that sued Subway for having 11 and a half inch foot long subs. So I’m dealing with all this and it’s tearing me up inside. Then, I was having a conversation with this friend of mine who’s been on multiple public boards. He’s in private equity for a super long time, very, very good investor. He’s like, “What?” He’s like, “This is the first time you’ve been sued.” He’s like, “I should sue you.” He’s like, “Welcome to the club.” He’s like, “What are you so upset about?” I was like, “What are you talking about?” I tried to justify it, and he’s like, “Ah. It’s fine.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” You just realize that a lot of the things you might contemplate now that you think are very big, huge problems, you can fix. A lot of it is just par for the course. REZA SATCHU: What do you think of this right to recover or what do you think human psychology is around recovery? Do people underestimate or overestimate their ability to recover? TIM FERRISS: I think it depends a lot on who you’re talking to, right? It’s like, if we’re talking to a bunch of refugees who had made hard choices. Then, I would say they probably accurately estimate their adaptiveness. REZA SATCHU: Ability. Yeah. TIM FERRISS: Their ability to adapt. I would say people who have, and this was me for a long time, executed to plan in a system where the rules are known, it’s more or less complete information, like higher education. It’s like, “Okay, great, you’re on the dean’s list, you’re summa cum laude, or whatever.” That those people underestimate their resilience, but I don’t actually think they’re wrong, because to develop the resilience you have to build some scar tissue. The only way you do that is by getting on the field. This sounds all abstract. It’s like, “No, okay, you want to change the world and build a billion-dollar company doing X?” It’s like, “All right, go talk to 10, go pitch 10 customers next week and ask them for money. As a dry run to get prepayment that will fund X, Y, or Z.” But don’t hide, and then I’m quoting Seth Godin, “But don’t hide behind the big.” Get out there and it’s going to be messy. BRIAN KENNY: Reza, I want to talk, so much of the case centers around optionality and all the options that Tim had in front of him, we talked about that a little bit upfront. I’m wondering, once you’ve achieved a certain level of success, a lot of opportunities open up. As a Founder, how do you sort through that? How do you think about what’s worth pursuing, what you shouldn’t pursue? What’s the thought process there? REZA SATCHU: Yeah, so it’s interesting. In my life, as someone who’s founded a few businesses, in some ways, the most recent businesses are harder, surprisingly. One would say, “Well, it’s easier because you’ve got more resources, more expertise, you have less hunger, and you have much more options. It’s not as critical that it has to succeed.” I teach and I found a business at the same time. That’s crazy. Most people would say that is not an optimal way to found a business. Whereas, my first couple of businesses, there’s no way I’d be teaching and founding a business. I’d be fully focused on founding. I think this idea that it gets easier, it might get easier from an expertise perspective, but suddenly you’ve got what I call the curse of optionality, which is you’ve got a number, and Tim, you’re facing some of this right now, frankly, this paradox of choice, which is precisely because of the success you’ve had you’ve got a whole bunch of choices. He mentioned Seth Godin, who’s a wonderful writer, who we interviewed for the case, and he said to Denise and me that we need to lock Tim in a room or in a cabin, and he needs to pick an option. Of course, what he was saying was that the world will be a much better place if Tim commits to something. As opposed to maximizing all of his options. I do think this curse, and for the students, people listening, I think that many of you will fall into this trap of preserving options for far too long and not knowing what you’re capable of when you commit. I’ve not had money and I’ve had money. Not having money is somewhat liberating because you just know what you need to do. When you have options, and those options could be a Harvard Business School degree, you suddenly start thinking, “Well, maybe I can preserve those options for a very long time.” I’m curious, Tim, I would ask you this question, which is you’ve got a whole bunch of options ahead of you. Here’s what I know to be true, is if you committed to one, I’m sure it will be far more impactful than if you preserve all of them. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, that’s true. I agree with that, but I would also say a few things. Number one is that you can validate or invalidate something really quickly. We were talking about this a bit earlier, but I was chatting with a student who was talking about maybe the safer route to finance and then less safe perhaps in entertainment, film potentially. I was saying, I’m saying, “All right, you know what’s going to really get attention, is if you’re an HBS grad who offers to shadow a show runner or a producer in pre-production on a movie, and you’re like, “Nothing is beneath me. Cleaning toilets, getting your coffee, I don’t care.'” It’s like, “All I want to do is observe some deal making and see what goes into making a film.” It’s like, “You can figure out if that is actually your dream or not very, very quickly. You might be completely allergic to it, but you can figure that out after a week of being in the pre-production office.” That’s number one. REZA SATCHU: But are you also suggesting that because that’s a differentiator, meaning, there’s something that it says about you, that you’re willing to do that? TIM FERRISS: Here’s my experience. Even though you might feel there’s very little time and a big rush, there’s not a big rush. You can take time to have these little detours and try things. The second is that even though I’m doing some different things, let’s just say angel investing newsletter foundation focused on mental health therapeutics, nonprofit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. There’s actually a way in which they reinforce one another. I will use, say, the podcast to interview scientists based on science I’m interested in to determine if I think they’re a good candidate for the foundation, or potentially, it doesn’t have to be a scientist. If I find that their personality is compatible enough and their idea is compelling enough that I want to make an investment in their company. I can use that as a discovery mechanism then for sourcing. I would say, also it depends on how much… Preserving all of your options also is just an illusion. You can’t really do that. The nature of making a decision, it’s like incision, decision to cut away. You are by definition cutting off a lot of paths, which I do for six to 12 months at a time. But you can have a few things, in my case, running at the same time in parallel. I would say optionality might not be all you think it is. If I look at hundreds of people I’ve interviewed on the podcast who are by any measure top performers in their fields, one of the most common comments or concepts that comes up is the power of positive constraints. Positive constraints, commit. It doesn’t have to be commit forever. It shouldn’t probably be commit forever, unless you’re the person who knows at age five that you want to do X. If you’re that, I don’t know, maybe you wouldn’t be here. REZA SATCHU: Positive constraints means cutting off options, in some sense? TIM FERRISS: It means cutting off options, or it could be anything. If you’re writing, it could be a space or page constraint. It could be, I have to write this all in third person or first person. REZA SATCHU: Well, it’s also your comment around, if I’ve got a problem, I will only solve it by taking something away. TIM FERRISS: Right, so in the case of the podcast, I found myself starting to drag my feet because it’s a very saturated marketplace. One of my key advantages that I had early on, besides just starting pretty early in 2014, was my research and the ability that I had to dig and find things that were interesting. Now, you can go in ChatGPT and say, “Give me 10 questions in the style of Tim Ferriss or Lex Friedman or Joe Rogan interviewing this person.” Boom, you’ll get good answers. That advantage has effectively disappeared, and there are a lot of ways to potentially respond to that. But for me, number one, I’m generally not looking for the cutting edge. I’m looking for dull edge. I want to see some proof of concept before I do angel investing or before I do some hare-brained thing, like make a card game, which some of you may have or not. That’s sitting up at the top for anybody who wants a copy. I think that fundamentally a lot of it comes down to asking yourself, how do you maximize for… I know this is, again, it’s so simple, but if you maximize for learning and relationships that transcend whatever that single project or job is, this is particularly effective if you are in a place like San Francisco. I don’t want to sell San Francisco. It’s pretty dirty and filthy. But I think if you were going to choose projects and you decided as a thought exercise to rank order the parameters as who, like who am I directly observing and working with? Then, where, and then what/sector, that actually comes last, I think you could end up with some pretty interesting options on the menu. BRIAN KENNY: We haven’t talked about impact, but I know that’s an important part of the thing that you cover in Founder’s Mindset. Can you talk a little bit about the idea of thinking about impact at the outset and not at the end of the journey? REZA SATCHU: I think so many people fall into this trap. I think I fell into this trap early in my career, which is my life is going to be in these stages. The impact stage will be that last piece of my life when I’ve learned a lot, when I’ve had the benefit of resources, all these sorts of things. The problem is there’s two problems. One is you may or may not be around for that last piece. BRIAN KENNY: Never know. REZA SATCHU: But the second point is it turns out that actually having impact along the way, and I love the way you describe it, which is start with the small things. Start with the people in your life that you’re… We all have these, especially here, have these visions of grandeur around having massive impact. Well, I’d say the most important way to do that is to actually start living a life of impact right away and on the small things. I think that, Tim, when you talk about, so what I view learning, what I view learning as, because a lot of people talk about you want to maximize learning, which I completely agree, and I’d be curious how you define learning. Okay, so I’m going to propose what my definition of learning is, and you tell me whether this, because I think it’s an important concept because learning is… If you had to say, what is the thing that is going to most correlate with impact, it would be learning. He who learns, he or she who learns the most is going to attract the most credibility, resources such that they can have the impact that they most desperately want. I define learning in the age of AI as the spot where you’re making… it’s all about decision making. Meaning, the trait we are most trying to learn is judgment. Judgment occurs when you’re making consequential decisions that you’re accountable for. You must live a life where you’re pushing yourself to make decisions, some of which will be wrong, some of which will be right, in order to build the thing we most want, which is judgment. Okay, so I’m curious to know your thoughts about that. TIM FERRISS: Learning, there’s how to learn, and then there’s what to learn. If you’re looking at say, who to work with, and then the where, and then the what, right? There are certain skills that are not going to transfer. It’s like, okay, if you’re in the waste management business and you’re understanding the ins and outs of waste management, I’m just making that up because I like unsexy stuff, that may not transfer to your hot shot AI startup for whatever, customer service. But if you are observing, this is an old school example, like a Wayne Huizenga. REZA SATCHU: Yeah, Wayne Huizenga. They don’t know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know. REZA SATCHU: You and I know who Wayne Huizenga is. TIM FERRISS: I know, waste management, then Blockbuster, which went extinct back in the Pleistocene era, but that guy was a master deal maker. If you’re able to watch someone acquiring dozens and dozens of companies, and how that entire dance is woven, that transfers. If you’re learning how to communicate, let’s just say, I’m making this up, you work for Cards Against Humanity. This is a very popular game as some of you may know, they were really, really good at PR stunts. If you work at that company when it is small and you’re involved with all of those PR stunts, which fundamentally are thinking about positioning and differentiation, that will apply to everything. It’s just asking yourself, where could this transfer? Where could this apply? Then, that’s the stuff that you focus on. For me, it’s in a sense meta skills, that if you were to copy and paste, you take somebody, look, it doesn’t matter. Well, I’ll give you actually maybe a more contemporary example, like Jeff Bezos. All right. What is Jeff Bezos’ superpower? I would say that it is having longer time horizons than almost everybody else, and defending and justifying and reiterating that in every shareholder letter. He trained Wall Street like a domesticated puppy, like a puppy. REZA SATCHU: From day one, yeah. TIM FERRISS: Talk about just incredible persuasion and the pro sleight of hand and also just business mastery. But the point is, if you have a longer time horizon than other people, that’s a huge competitive advantage also in and of itself. If you can be around someone who exemplifies that, because I can say that, and you’re like, “Okay, I got it.” But it’s like, do you really? You need to see how that is emphasized over and over again. Or, like a Herb Kelleher at Southwest. Would I have loved to have worked for that guy? Would I have quit my tech job to work for him? Absolutely, because such a maniacal focus on being the low cost airline. I remember he was interviewed at one point and he said to the journalists, because they were saying how hard it was, what he did, and he’s like, “No, you can do my job.” Then, he’s like, “All right, give me a situation.” They gave him a situation. He’s like, “All right, does that help us to be the low cost airline or not?” They’re like, “No.” He’s like, “Yeah, that’s a no.” He’s like, “Okay, next one.” He’s like, “Yeah.” If you have the focus, but you need to be around people who are doing that and living it so you can see it in different contexts. This is going to sound bizarre because I’m thinking about adopting another dog. But there’s an expression in dog training, which is basically if the dog hasn’t done it, say a behavior, shaping a behavior in 20 different locations, 20 different durations, they don’t have that behavior. It’s not durable. Humans are the same. It’s conditioning. Having the opportunity to work with someone where you see certain characteristics exemplified; certain behaviors, certain principles enacted that can be applied to different businesses, man, I think that’s an incredible shortcut. But you and I have different perspectives on this. I think working for a startup’s a fantastic way to learn on someone else’s dime with the understanding that- BRIAN KENNY: That’s our youngest audience member, by the way. TIM FERRISS: Yeah. Start them young. Start them young. REZA SATCHU: It’s true. What I’d say, I think just, look, I think the question is, in the age of AI, what are the traits that we can teach people? I think that the challenge is that things like memorization and observation are far less valuable. What is valuable is this elusive thing called judgment. The real question is, how do we get it? I think, yeah, you can get it by watching someone else, but how you really get it is by doing it yourself. Actually being in the arena, making those decisions. One of the things you said, Tim, which is very interesting to me, because I have a similar phrase, when you said you have a bias for action. I have a phrase which is, if in doubt, act, which immediately people say, “Well, wait, Reza, you don’t know what you’re doing, you’re going to act?” No, the reason I say that is because so many people are paralyzed by imperfect or uncertain information, and so they’re like deer in headlights. What I suggest is, even if you’re going to stay the course, train yourself to make a decision that you’re actually staying the course, which is a bias for action. I’m curious how you think about, bias for action is, it feels risky. I’m curious how you view that. TIM FERRISS: What I would say is I have a tendency… My mom literally got me a shirt that says, ”Wait a second, let me overthink this.” My tendency is to, I don’t want to say perseverate, but over consider the ramifications of a lot of decisions. It’s been a practice of conditioning myself to be like, all right, what if I tried what Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn and so on has done, where he wants to enable his chief of staff to act quickly enough that they roughly get things wrong 10% of the time. That’s literally a guideline that he uses with his chief of staff. He says 10% footfall, which is a little confusing because it’s a tennis reference. Anyway, but I think applying that to your own life where you’re like, all right, what can I put on automatic, just no decision autopilot default, number one, where can I just completely remove decisions? Sometimes that’s with diet, exercise. You don’t want to get up in the morning and decide which of 20 toothpaste tubes you’re going to use. You have your toothpaste and you just deal with your toothpaste. Similarly, you could extrapolate that and apply it to giving employees autonomous decision-making power and creating a culture where you actually reward screw-ups. I literally met with, I was having a blood draw this morning because I’m in Boston for proteomics assay. Anyway, it’s a long story. But they have a dedicated discord within the company for celebrating bleep-ups basically. That are not egregious. It’s also like, all right, how do we not do this again? But people get rewarded for ambition, mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth, which is straight from Machiavelli, so I’m not sure how I feel about that. But in any case, I don’t know about also… I got stuck on the AI stuff again, because I don’t know, I wish I could give everybody and myself a strategy for making yourself AI proof. I don’t know what that looks like. I think though you can make a decision about, am I going to use these tools or am I going to stick my head in the sand and try to find a way around them? I think probably the way to go for it is spend your evenings for two weeks vibe coding and messing around with AI, so that you have some idea of how you might utilize it. Because within two or three years, we’re going to have multi-billion dollar companies or billion-dollar companies with one to three employees, I’m very confident in that. They’ll just use agents to fill a lot of roles, like CFO and so on. People are already doing this. I wouldn’t get too hung up on that. Although I would say, if I were to play the counterpoint, that the soft skills that I was mentioning earlier, negotiating, deal-making, this is a very intrinsically human interaction. REZA SATCHU: Human thing. TIM FERRISS: It’s very rare that you’re just going to be able to send pitch emails with the deal structure and you’re like, “Yes or no, thumbs up?” With this emoticon based on my AI chatbot, like, “Great. Let’s do a deal.” Typically, not how it works, especially as the stakes get bigger, which don’t mean they’re huge, that they’re just consequential for whoever you’re dealing with. That stuff I don’t see going away anytime soon. BRIAN KENNY: I want to give time. We’re coming close to the end of our time. I’ve got one more question for each of you, but before we do that, Tim, maybe you want to tell people about your latest venture? Because I think there are some takeaways, some giveaway items. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, if people want, so this is a very off menu thing. BRIAN KENNY: It’s just like the Oprah Show. You’re going to get something to take with you. TIM FERRISS: Yeah, exactly. It’s not a car, but it’s something else. I ended up collaborating with this guy, Elan Lee, who’s one of the world’s best game designers for the last two years to create a card game for off-screen social interaction. That’s my current project, is a card game of all things. I could explain why I chose that, but the biggest one was the who. This Elan Lee, where I was like, “I would pay to just hang out with this guy.” He’s such a soulful, deep thinker, who’s ethical and also happens to be a polymath, top 1% in multiple fields. I was like, “I just want to steep myself in whatever magic juju this guy has.” That’s how fundamentally I made the decision. Yeah, there are games up there, it’s called COYOTE. Then, beyond that, I do have an 800-page draft of a book. That’s not an overstatement. I’ll be whittling that down over the next six months probably. That’s been like eight years in the making. It’s been sitting back there for a long time. There’s other stuff going on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s awesome. Now, this has been a great conversation. I knew it would be. I was so excited to do this today. Before I let you go, I’ll ask the same question of each of you, and I’ll start with you, Tim, and I always give the professor the last word because it’s Harvard Business School, but it’s a pretty simple question. TIM FERRISS: Reza is pretty good at getting the last word anyway. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s true. REZA SATCHU: That’s true. That is definitely BRIAN KENNY: If you just think about the case, you’ve lived it, what lessons do you think emerging founders should take from the case about navigating similar inflection points in their own journey? TIM FERRISS: Let’s see. I’m going to give credit to a mentor of mine named Ed Zschau. He was a professor of mine at Princeton, taught really the first entrepreneurship class that I’m aware of, “High-tech Entrepreneurship,” ELE 491. Still have all my notes from the class. He used to teach at HBS and then jump-started this entrepreneurship program at Princeton. He was congressman from Silicon Valley, former competitive figure skater, took a couple of companies public. Was one of the first, if not the first computer science teacher at Stanford, even though he had no computer science background. It was like somebody else dropped out and they’re like, “Can anybody else teach this class? He was like, “Oh, I’ll figure it out.” Back in the day. In his last class, I think I’m getting the name of this song right, but he actually gets up and he sings this song. I’m going to do it my way. The whole point is everybody’s making up everything by and large. There is no one right way to do it. I think that what I would hope people to take from my very bizarre case study, and I say that, I couldn’t have been prouder and happier with how everybody put it together, Denise and Reza and so on, is that you don’t have to follow the prescription, whatever the prescription is. You don’t have to meet the expectations, whatever the expectations are. You just don’t have to do it. There are a lot of ways to improvise and zig and zag. As long as you’re not too calcified around what you consider your identity. You just have to be really careful with painting yourself into a corner with that. That’s what I would hope people to take from it, is just there is a lot of room to improvise and maneuver. People ask me a lot, for instance, I’ve done these 800 plus interviews on the podcast, and they’re like, “What are the commonalities?” I’m like, “The greatest commonality is there are no commonalities.” It’s like for every incredible writer who gives me one set of advice, I sit in front of the screen, even if it’s blank for 10 hours a day, chained myself to the desk. To, B.J. Novak of The Office and movies and all sorts of stuff, he was like, “Yeah, I really need to get into the mood.” It’s like, “I’ll have my cappuccino, I’ll read the paper, I’ll do this thing. I really need to be in the right state to write.” They’re both doing amazing jobs, and they have diametrically opposing advice, which means you can figure out what rules and what stories work for you. I would just say mess around. You have your whole life to be safe and conservative and not politically. You get the idea. Like color within the lines. I guess you could have the rest of your life to be conservative too politically. But the point is, there will never, in my opinion, be a better time for you guys coming out of HBS to just embrace your weird self and try some of the stuff that is going to get harder to do later. REZA SATCHU: Look, I think that’s extremely well said. Tim, when we wrote this case study, in some ways it’s probably the longest case study because he’s got so many things going on. My students are probably like, “This is a 20-plus page story.” It’s everything from dancing, to an author, to podcasts, to all sorts of things. If I had to summarize it, I’d want two takeaways. One is, live a life full of curiosity and allow yourself to explore the things that you’re curious with. Whether that’s these experiments, small C commitments, just suspend disbelief and trust your judgment to actually explore things that you’re curious in. The upside is far greater than the downside. That’s the first point. The second point is, I really think Tim’s risk framework is very interesting. In some ways you hear a story and you immediately think, “Well, this guy is embracing risk at every turn.” It’s actually the opposite. He understands that he has to live a life with risk, but he’s actually thinking really hard about how to calibrate it. The way he does that is by actually understanding that his downside is nowhere near as bad as we all think it is. It’s defining his fears, which allows him to hopefully do something extraordinary because he’s shifting what the outcome could be. I think that is really, I would say those are, trust your curiosity and embrace risk, but calibrate it appropriately and understand that, especially coming out of a school like Harvard, your downside is nowhere near as bad as you think it is. TIM FERRISS: I’d love to add just a few things real quick. The risk mitigation stuff and thinking about that, if people are interested, I wrote these a long time ago, but it’s a two-part blog post series called How, I think it’s just “How I Created a Real World MBA.” Related to how I tiptoed my way into angel investing. REZA SATCHU: Well, this is your angel investing. TIM FERRISS: I think that’s worth, I think people in this room might find that an interesting read. The second is really study the outliers. Because if anyone has done it, there is the possibility that you could also do it or chart your own path. A book that you might not expect, it’s one called The Art of Possibility, I think the author’s last name, it’s by a husband and wife duo, Zander, Z-A-N-D-E-R. It’s very fast read, amazing book. There are a lot of book recommendations I could give, but that’s a fast one that I would encourage people to check out. Really study the outliers, like Yvon Chouinard, the early chapters, the early chapters, or if you think of someone who’s a risk-taker, like Richard Branson, read Losing My Virginity. It’s like at every turn that guy is hedging risk and minimizing and mitigating risk. It’s remarkable how good he is at capping downside. I would just say, study the outliers. There are a lot of ways to tiptoe into things to figure out a signal very, very quickly at low cost. BRIAN KENNY: I think that’s a good note to end on.

Title: Stock market ‘concentration risk’ now higher than dot-com bubble period, IMF warns

Full Content:
Market valuations have “become stretched”, increasing the probably of a “disorderly correction”, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned. In its latest Global Financial Stability update, published alongside its half-year report on the global economy, the Washington-based fund highlights the concentration risk within the US’s S&P 500 index from the so-called magnificent seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia). It noted that the information technology sector accounted for a weight of 35 per cent of the total S&P 500, similar to during the dot-com bubble of the 1990s, but this time just seven stocks accounted for 33 per cent of the index. That meant the concentration risk “was now substantially higher than during the dot-com bubble”. Many analysts believe stock markets, particularly in the US, are on the brink of major negative correction following an investment glut in artificial intelligence (AI). AI-related companies have accounted for around 80 per cent of US stock market gains this year. [ Negative impact of tariffs starting to show, IMF warnsOpens in new window ] In its report, the IMF said the rebound in global equity prices since US president Donald Trump’s April tariff announcement had outpaced expected future earnings. Despite recent economic data trending negative, markets appear to be downplaying the potential effects of US tariffs on growth and inflation, it said. Global financial markets “have largely brushed off subsequent shocks and uncertainties,” it said, noting financial conditions across most regions have eased back to “accommodative levels”. But it warned “the apparent calm masks a degree of complacency.” “Despite trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and rising concerns about sovereign indebtedness, asset prices have returned to stretched valuations and financial conditions have broadly eased,” it said. “Against substantial AI-related investments, the possibility of mega-cap stocks failing to generate expected returns to justify current lofty equity valuations could trigger deterioration in investor sentiment and make the stocks susceptible to sudden, sharp correction,” the IMF said. An analysis of sovereign bond markets also highlighted “growing pressure from widening fiscal deficits on the functioning of markets,” it said.

In its report, the IMF also highlighted the weakness of the US dollar “Overall, the dollar has depreciated by about 10 per cent so far this year against major currencies,” it said. “Analysts have put forth a number of possible drivers for dollar weakness, from a revaluation of dollar strength amid concerns over the US fiscal position to a shift in allocation away from US-dollar-denominated assets driven by concerns about US policy uncertainty,” it said.

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. Mumbai/Bengaluru: There was no high-decibel government event, or even an investor roadshow. The message was tucked inside K. Krithivasan’s prepared remarks, in a recent media release. India’s largest IT services exporter, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the company Krithivasan now heads, is preparing for the biggest gamble of its five-decade existence: a massive $6.5 billion investment over six years to forge one gigawatt (GW) of new data centre capacity. Consider the sheer scale of ambition for a moment: This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base within six years, and the capital expenditure eclipses the combined value of all TCS acquisitions over the last two decades. That ambition also underlies a tectonic shift within TCS. For decades, the company exported code and consultancy, intangible services that powered global enterprises but left few physical footprints at home. Now, it is choosing to pour billions into concrete, steel and copper. The country’s most profitable IT exporter is turning inward, betting that India’s artificial intelligence (AI) revolution would need not just algorithms, but infrastructure. That shift is particularly striking given the group’s own history. Back in 2016, another Tata company, Tata Communications, effectively jettisoned its data centre play, deeming it “non-core." The sister concern sold 74% stake in its data centre business to a Temasek Holdings unit for $634 million. Three of those data centres were in Singapore; the rest across India. By last year, Tata Communications had divested its remaining 26%. Under chairman Cyrus Mistry, it seemed the group had moved on from the brick-and-mortar complexities of digital infrastructure. Under N. Chandrasekaran—the man who once put TCS on a high growth orbit—the pendulum has violently swung back. So when Krithivasan—himself a quiet engineer who inherited the corner office after Rajesh Gopinathan’s abrupt exit in 2023—outlined this unprecedented investment, it was more than a capex announcement. It signalled a philosophical reversal within the Tata ecosystem, a return to building the physical foundations of digital India. “The Tata Group companies are in power, real estate, project management businesses…So, there is a different kind of synergy we can build in here," Krithivasan said, during a call with analysts on 9 October. The timing, though, came against an uneasy backdrop. Ahead of TCS’s latest earnings, on 9 October, its stock was languishing near a 52-week low. Growth was tapering. Analysts at Motilal Oswal and Nuvama projected a full-year revenue decline—the first since TCS’s 2004 listing. The mood across India’s $283-billion IT industry was sombre. Global clients were trimming technology budgets, US visa restrictions had upended the traditional onsite-offshore model, and TCS had just confirmed the layoff of over 6,000 employees in the September quarter. In this subdued climate, the $6.5 billion commitment stood out as an act of economic courage, an attempt to reimagine TCS’s future rather than merely defend its margins. TCS did not respond to Mint’s detailed questionnaire seeking comments. April at the TajThe idea took shape earlier this year. In April, Chandrasekaran, who has been steadily integrating the Tata empire into a digital-industrial group, asked senior TCS executives to explore the data centre opportunity. It was a directive rooted in strategic timing as much as necessity. The same month, at a high-profile event in Delhi’s Taj Mansingh Hotel, TCS unveiled its ‘sovereign cloud network’, a service designed to store and process data entirely within Indian borders in compliance with new data-localization rules. It was a logical extension of TCS’s IT services portfolio: the company already provided engineers, managed IT infrastructure, and offered private cloud services. What it lacked was real estate—the physical layer of computing power that anchored the digital world. View Full Image In April this year, TCS unveiled its sovereign cloud network. (iStockphoto) That gap is precisely what the new investment aims to close. Data centres are the factories of the AI age—vast, secure facilities that house the servers, networking equipment and cooling systems needed to process and store the petabytes of data generated every day. India’s regulatory mandates and digital explosion have created a perfect storm of demand. The Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, now requires payment data to be stored domestically; the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the markets regulator, has similar stipulations for market participants. As 5G networks roll out and connected devices multiply, the volume of data produced by consumers, vehicles, and industrial systems is surging. Add the rise of generative AI, and the need for high-speed computing infrastructure becomes existential. TCS believes it can monetize this infrastructure in two ways: leasing capacity to hyperscalers such as Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, and using it for its own contracts with governments and enterprises. The company’s first 150 MW facility, to be built at a cost of $1 billion, is expected to go live within 18 months. Different from AccentureThe move also marks a clear break from how TCS’s global peers have evolved. Accenture, the $70-billion consulting giant, has doubled down on advisory-led AI and analytics rather than infrastructure. Its bet is that the profits lie in algorithms, not assets. Indian peers like Infosys and HCL Tech have largely taken the same path, positioning themselves as service orchestrators on top of third-party cloud platforms. On 13 October, HCL Tech announced that it had won $100 million in revenue from AI operations in the September quarter, making the Noida-based company the first among Big Five to quantify revenue from AI technologies. TCS, by contrast, is wading into the physical side of that digital stack. It is a high-stakes pivot that could recast its risk profile and profit structure. “The beauty of the data centre business is its recurring stability," said one executive familiar with the plan. “But it will test patience before delivering cash returns." The executive did not want to be identified. Dividend resetThe patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. View Full Image TCS is venturing into what is known as colocation data centres. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations. The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations.

The stock’s 3.5% dip in three days following the announcement suggests the market is already doing so. “TCS management stated that each 150-megawatt build-out phase of the data centre will require $1 billion capex, for a $6.5 billion total investment. We think this direction could offer new potential revenue streams though could negatively impact margins," Keith Bachman, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note dated 9 October. McKinsey states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices. Returns are slow, and could take a decade. In addition, technology cycles move faster than depreciation schedules. “This is an asset-intensive industry where labour-arbitrage advantages don’t translate," said Peter Bendor-Samuel of Everest Group, a research firm. “Investors used to high-margin, low-capex returns will need to recalibrate." Analysts at JM Financial estimated revenue from 1MW of operational data centres in the first year to be about ₹22 crore. TCS’s target of having a 150 MW data centre operational by April 2027 implies an incremental business of ₹3,300 crore. A successful operational capacity of 1 GW in six years would translate to about ₹22,000 crore, similar to its India revenue of ₹21,958 crore last year. The 3% problemThe deeper question is why TCS waited until now. For years, Indian conglomerates like Reliance and Adani have been laying the groundwork for data centre dominance, tying these projects to their energy and telecom networks. The global hyperscalers, meanwhile, have been expanding capacity across India as part of their global grids. The Tatas, cautious and conservative, stayed on the sidelines. Part of that hesitation stemmed from perception. Data centres were once viewed less as cutting-edge technology and more as glorified real-estate plays—capital-heavy, regulatory-ridden, and operationally messy. They required land, reliable electricity, and long-term financing, all of which had tripped up the Tata Group before. For a company built on intellectual capital, the business felt foreign. What has changed is the scale of the opportunity. India today accounts for roughly 20% of global data generation but only about 3% of storage capacity. Its total installed capacity—around one GW—is precisely what TCS aims to build by 2030. Analysts at Cushman & Wakefield estimate that India’s data centre capacity will triple to 1,825 megawatt (MW) by 2027, driven by new data-localization rules and the country’s voracious digital appetite. States are competing fiercely for investment. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana are offering everything from electricity-duty waivers to land subsidies of up to 50%. Mumbai, with undersea cable landings and strong power grids, remains the favoured hub, but smaller cities are emerging as contenders. For TCS, whose domestic revenue still accounts for less than 10% of its total ($30.18 billion) but grew 62% last year—largely due to a ₹1.5-billion BSNL contract—the timing aligns with a broader strategic shift toward India-focused business. As global clients hesitate, India’s digital infrastructure push offers both stability and scale. The orchestraMeanwhile, the data centre gamble will not only test TCS’s financial muscle but execution capability as well. Building and operating data centres demands coordination across engineering, real estate, power management, and cybersecurity—far removed from writing code. Yet, this is where the Tata Group’s breadth could become a decisive advantage. TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies that rivals like Infosys or Wipro simply cannot replicate. “TCS has a unique opportunity to serve the broader Tata Group across businesses in telecom, networks, energy and cooling solutions," said Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at Catalincs, a consulting firm. “It can cross leverage these capabilities across the conglomerate structure, something that other large IT companies don’t have." TCS can draw on group companies such as Tata Power, Tata Communications, Nelco, and Tata Electronics for power supply, network connectivity, satellite links, and chip technology. That’s a web of synergies. Still, competition will be fierce. To find its niche, TCS must differentiate not by sheer size but by integration—offering clients a seamless bridge between the data centre and the AI workloads that run on it. “TCS is not trying to compete with AWS or Azure on a raw scale," said Phil Fersht, chief executive of HFS Research, a consulting firm. “It’s trying to own the intersection of infrastructure and services—both the data centre and the AI models that sit on top. That’s where the value will lie." Such integration could also help TCS reposition itself in the eyes of investors. Global data centre operators like Equinix and Digital Realty command enterprise-value multiples of 20 to 22 times Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization), higher than Indian IT firms’ price-earnings ratios. If TCS can credibly present itself as both a technology and infrastructure play, it could attract a new class of investors seeking exposure to digital infrastructure. Still, this is not a business for those seeking quick wins. Like we mentioned earlier, data centres are a low margin play. Yet for TCS, this may be less about margins than momentum. The IT industry is at an inflection point: AI threatens to commoditize traditional outsourcing even as clients demand end-to-end digital transformation. Owning infrastructure offers TCS a new strategic lever, a way to control the stack from physical data to cognitive intelligence. “TCS’ moat won’t be real estate—it will be orchestration," said Fersht. “By owning the infrastructure, it can combine data engineering and AI services under one roof." Krithivasan’s wager, then, is not for immediate approval but for long-term relevance. As India’s data centre capacity surges and its AI ambitions swell, the company is positioning itself at the intersection of both trends. If it captures even a modest slice of the coming capacity boom, TCS could evolve from an outsourcing icon into a domestic infrastructure powerhouse. For the Tata Group, too, this is a return to form. From steel and power to software and satellites, its empire has always thrived on long horizons. The data centre bet is merely the digital reincarnation of that legacy. For Krithivasan, the challenge is deeply personal. He took charge in a moment of flux—after a surprise leadership exit, in a slowing industry, with AI rewriting the rules of competition. Now he must steer a company known for intangible efficiency into a world of tangible assets and operational grit. If he succeeds, TCS will not just sell cloud services—it will own a piece of the cloud itself. Key Takeaways TCS will spend $6.5 billion over six years to develop 1GW of data centre capacity. This planned capacity alone is enough to match India’s entire current data centre base. The investment is driven by the explosion of demand for high-speed computing infrastructure due to AI, and India’s data-localization rules that require data to be stored within her borders. The move is enabled by the Tata conglomerate's breadth—TCS plans to leverage sister companies like Tata Power and Tata Communications for power supply and connectivity. This marks a fundamental reversal for TCS; it is shifting from being an asset-light exporter of intangible code and services to becoming a capital-intensive physical infrastructure player. But, data centres are a low-margin, capex-intensive business with slow returns. This risks diluting TCS’ margins, forcing investors accustomed to high dividend payouts to recalibrate expectations. The patience required may be considerable. Unlike software projects, data centres are capital-intensive, slow to scale and operationally demanding. TCS’s decision to build rather than rent puts it in competition with hyperscalers and domestic real-estate developers alike. The company is entering a field already crowded with global giants—Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon—as well as Indian powerhouses such as Reliance, AdaniConnex and Yotta. The irony is that, given its scale and client relationships, TCS should have been a natural candidate to own data centres years ago. Instead, it spent two decades returning wealth to shareholders— ₹3.66 trillion through dividends and buybacks since its listing. That generosity may now come at a cost. With the new investment cycle, margins could tighten, and dividend payouts to parent Tata Sons may moderate. Last year, TCS contributed 83% of Tata Sons’ income. Data centres can be bracketed into four types. First, there are the enterprise data centres, which are facilities owned and run by companies and houses their computing networks. A second category is hyperscale data centres, also known as Cloud data centres. Amazon and Microsoft own and manage these facilities. Edge data centres are the third category. Here, smaller facilities are set up closer to an organization, thereby improving speed, and are essential for real-time data processing tasks. Finally, there are the colocation data centres, a space TCS is venturing into. In this category, the data centre owner sets up the physical infrastructure, manages the facility, oversees the building, power, and cooling for the servers. The customer supplies and manages their equipment. McKinsey, a consulting firm, states that colocation data centres operate at lower profitability than cloud data centres. This is because the hyperscalers, who are the primary customers of colocation data centres, can negotiate better prices since they also set up and have their own facilities. The operating margins of Equinix and Sify, who run colocation data centres, are in the range of 22% and 19%, respectively. In comparison, the operating margins enjoyed by AWS and Azure are significantly higher, at 35-37%. Executives say TCS’s balance sheet can absorb the shock. The company generated ₹46,449 crore in free cash flow last year, more than enough to underwrite the initial phases. Yet investors accustomed to industry-leading operating margins (TCS ended with 24.3% in operating margin last year) may need to reset expectations.

OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. Congress released its second list of candidates for the Bihar Assembly elections, but the Mahagathbandhan is still working on a seat-sharing arrangement for the first phase of polling. The Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will contest six seats on its own. The elections will be held in two phases on November 6 and 11, with results on November 14.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or
