Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

The stock market may be feeling a little bubbly, but it is nothing like the parabolic, internet-hyped tech trade of the late 1990s. Oracle’s near 40% one-day surge last week on a bullish forecast stirred up memories of that frothy period—and some concern about excess AI optimism. But there is a big difference between now and the stock market party of 1999: Companies now are making real money. Back then, “the price performance was insane," said Dan Greenhaus, strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. “Stocks were splitting multiple times a year because the appreciation was so great." “Everything was going public, whether they had any sales or not. There was a level of enthusiasm across markets and sectors that really doesn’t feel similar to today." Today’s major tech companies are pricey, but nowhere close to “dot-com bubble valuations," Greenhaus said. The bull market could run longer. Famously, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance" to describe elevated asset prices in December 1996, years before the market peaked. Tech stocks tied to AI are benefiting from real impacts on their earnings. Market darling Nvidia “keeps going up in general, but it isn’t getting more expensive," Greenhaus said. The stock’s rise is driven by “extreme earnings and sales revisions," not just valuations, he said. Oracle’s big stock move came after the company reported an AI revenue forecast much stronger than the market expected. It now sees its cloud infrastructure revenue reaching $144 billion over the next four years, up from a projected $18 billion this fiscal year. The companies driving the market today “have so much excess cash flow that they’re buying back their stock," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. “They can still spend on capital expenditure and research and development, and they still have plenty of money to buy back their stocks. That was the exact opposite of the tech bubble," Rieder said. Rieder said AI adoption is “an extraordinary expenditure that is changing the economic landscape" with the power to bring about huge gains in productivity. The breadth of the AI trade is also much greater than the internet and Y2K focused trade of the late 1990s and early 2000. Stocks that were considered “old economy" at the time traded with low valuations, while internet-related plays commanded sky high premiums. The market is treating AI innovation differently. Evercore ISI describes its influence on stocks as a “participatory democracy," with the potential to benefit the companies that create it, support it, and use it. AI can create winners across industries, well beyond tech. The firm notes that a quarter of companies are adopting AI just three years after the public launch of ChatGPT. During the last two years of the tech bubble, more stocks were going down daily than were rising, signaling a serious deterioration in the health of the market, according to Evercore ISI. That is opposite what is happening now, with more stocks advancing, taking indexes higher. The broader profit picture is also different. “Intel, Sun Micro, Cisco, Microsoft, the big guys were profitable then. It was the huge satellite of peripheral companies that weren’t profitable," Greenhaus said. Amazon, one of the tech heavyweights in the Magnificent 7, wasn’t profitable during the tech bubble. Its first quarterly profit was in 2021. “The best money wasn’t made on the companies that were building the internet. The best money was made on the companies that became the business because of the internet. Amazon, for instance," Greenhaus said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she is seeing some signs of froth in the market. But she believes the bull market will continue. “When sentiment gets to the frothier end of the spectrum, that sentiment can last for a long time," said Sonders. While the Magnificent 7 stocks have fueled much of the gains in the S&P 500, the tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, aren’t the biggest gainers in the stock market this year, she notes. Meta is the best performing Mag 7 stock in the S&P 500, but it is the 57th best performing stock in the S&P, while Alphabet was 58th, according to Schwab. Sonders said she currently isn’t recommending specific sectors, or even just high-quality stocks. She sees “opportunity a little bit down the quality spectrum into some of the more value-oriented areas, but you don’t want to sacrifice decent growth opportunities." She looks for factors like positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprises, low price-to-book, low-price-to-sales, and amount of free cash flow. Some strategists have been expecting a correction to tamp down some of the market’s enthusiasm. Sonders said there has been a rolling correction across the market. She notes the S&P 500 was down 19% at its low point this year, while at the average member level, the drawdown was 25% from the year-to-date highs. The S&P quickly recovered and went on to set new highs. Sonders said the biggest gainers of the Nasdaq currently include small, lesser-known stocks. “There are retail traders’ fingerprints all over this market move. They are sort of full steam ahead—and they buy the dip, buy every little dip. And so at some point you could argue, the music ends. But it could last awhile."

Title:  Is AI a bubble? - by Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren
URL: https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-09-21T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A month ago, I set out to answer a deceptively simple question: Is AI a bubble? Since 2024, people have been asking me this as I’ve spoken at events around the world. Even as Wall Street bankers largely see this as an investment boom, more people are asking the question in meeting rooms and conference halls in Europe and the US. Some have made up their minds. Gary Marcus called it a “peak bubble.” The Atlantic warns that there is a “possibility that we’re currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology’s near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame – and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won’t be the only ones who suffer.” The Economist said that “the potential cost has risen alarmingly high.” The best way to understand a question like this is to create a framework, one that you can update as new evidence emerges. Putting this together has taken dozens of hours of data analysis, modeling and numerous conversations with investors and executives. This essay is that framework: five gauges to weigh genAI against history’s bubbles. I studied and lived through the dot-com bubble. I was an investor and felt its effects firsthand.1 Like many of you, I was also active during the Global Financial Crisis. For this reason, I’ve invested considerable thought and analysis into a robust framework to understand what’s going on. I’ll share it with you today. My thinking is grounded in the study of Carlota Perez, Bill Janeway and other giants in the field, as well as financial analyses of major banks and analysts. But what I haven’t seen anywhere else is a framework that translates those theories into a practical dashboard for AI today: a set of parameters you can read, compare across past bubbles and use to orient your decisions. We will make the underlying data and methodology available to members of Exponential View in the coming weeks. I usually reserve my deep dives for paying members of Exponential View. But this question is too important, and the public debate clouded by posturing, for me to keep it behind a paywall. So today’s piece is free for everyone to read. If you want to access this analysis as a PDF, you can download it here. If you are an investor or executive navigating these questions, I am opening a very limited number of consultation sessions to work directly on them. This is a bespoke opportunity to stress-test your strategy with the same analytical framework I’ve developed. You can apply here. Bubbles are among the oldest stories of capitalism. They’re parables of excess, belief and collapse. But bubbles are not just financial phenomena; they are cultural artifacts. They return again and again as morality tales about greed and folly. Tulip mania, often misremembered as a frenzy of bankrupt weavers and drowning merchants, was less disastrous than legend suggests. It was confined to wealthy merchants and left the Dutch economy largely unscathed. But the myth has endured, and that is the point: bubbles become stories we tell ourselves about the dangers of optimism. Some bubbles are financial: the South Sea frenzy of the 1720s, the roaring stock market of the 1920s, Japan’s real-estate boom in the 1980s and the housing crash of 2008.2 Some are technological. In the 1840s, railways were hailed as the veins of a new industrial body. They were. But a body needs only so many veins, and tracks were soon laid in places commerce could not sustain. Telecoms in the 1990s promised a wired utopia, only for 70 million miles of excess fiber to lie dark underground. The dot-com boom gave us visions of a new economy, much of which did eventually materialize, but not before valuations evaporated in 2000. The funny thing is that there doesn’t seem to be an academic consensus on what an investment bubble is. Nobel laureate in economics Eugene Fama has gone so far as to say they don’t exist. I want to go beyond the notion that we know a bubble when we see a bubble. There are two interrelated systems at work. The first, the most visible, is when stock markets become absurdly overvalued and collapse. The second is whether the quantity of productive capital (going into capital expenditure or venture capital) deployed collapses. The two are related, of course. A collapse in equity prices makes investment flows more expensive. And a secular decline in productive capital investment may be read by equity markets as a harbinger of a slowdown. But to frame this: we see a bubble as being a 50% drawdown from the peak equity value that is sustained for at least five years. In the case of the US housing bubble and the dot-com, that trough was roughly five years long. Full recovery to pre-bubble peaks took 10 years for US housing, and 15 for the dot-com. Alongside, we would expect a substantial decline in the rate of productive capital deployed, once again 50% from peak. For the purposes of this analysis, by “bubble” I’ll address both of those competing dimensions. Ultimately, it means a phase marked by a rapid escalation in prices and investment, where valuations drift materially away from the underlying prospects and realistic earnings power of the assets involved. Bubbles thrive on abundant capital and seductive narratives, and they tend to end in a sharp and sustained reversal that wipes out much of the paper wealth created on the way up. A “boom,” by contrast, can look very similar in its early stages with rising valuations and accelerating investment. But the crucial distinction is that, in a boom, fundamentals eventually catch up. The underlying cash flows, productivity gains, or genuine demand growth rise to meet the optimism. Booms can still overshoot, but they consolidate into durable industries and lasting economic value. Between the two lies a gray zone: periods of exuberance when it is genuinely hard to tell whether capital is building the foundations of a new economy or merely inflating prices that will not be sustained. It’s like being in the eye of a storm: you can feel the wind, rain and pressure, but you don’t yet know whether it will clear the air or flatten the house. This brings us to the present question: is AI another bubble? What unsettles many observers are the numbers. Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, hyperscalers have more than doubled their annual data center capex, betting heavily on the infrastructure needed to train and run ever-larger models. When Sam Altman floated a $7 trillion investment requirement last year, it sounded like hubris. Today, investors aren’t laughing; they’re wondering whether the scale of spending is sustainable. Bubbles are impossible to diagnose in real time. Only in retrospect do we know whether exuberance was justified or delusional. Rather than making a definitive call — which borders on unhelpful speculation — it’s better to benchmark today’s boom against history to spot where bubble-like dynamics may be creeping in. We’re thinking of this as flying a plane. Pilots don’t rely on a single instrument. They monitor a cluster of gauges to understand how the flight is going. We’ll use five of them here: Gauge 1 – Economic strain: Is investment now large enough to bend the economy? Gauge 2 – Industry strain: Are industry revenues commensurate with the deployed capex? Gauge 3 – Revenue growth: Is revenue rising/broadening fast enough to catch up? Gauge 4 – Valuation heat: How hot are valuations? Compared to history, are stocks excessively overpriced? Gauge 5 – Funding quality: What kind of money is funding this? Is it strong balance sheets, or fragile, flighty capital? In the rest of the essay, I look at each gauge to explain why it may be green, amber or red, and at the end I pull them together into a full dashboard view. The investment underway is vast, with Morgan Stanley expecting $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by 2029. But it has not yet reached the runaway extremes of history’s great blowouts. What makes this dimension tricky is dependence. In the US, more than a third of GDP growth can be traced to data center construction. This is not inherently bad, but it may be dangerous if the momentum falters. An economy leaning this heavily on one sector for growth can find the ground falling away faster than expected. The surge of capital expenditure (capex), poured into the physical infrastructure that AI demands, is an act of optimism. This is what capex is. Money spent today in the belief that it will become a funnel of revenue tomorrow. If it’s well-placed today, it will eventually lead to productivity gains and economic expansion. If you want to sell people hula hoops to promote their health and happiness, you need to buy hula hoops first. And somewhere down the line, there needs to be a factory making them. Funding that factory is capex. You deploy the capex to build a useful thing that you can sell. Capex investment is often, but not always, a precursor to a growing business. AI data centers have a similar quality, and something more. They are not just factories for a single product; they are infrastructure. Microsoft, OpenAI and the US government all see it this way. They see compute as a foundational utility of the 21st century, no less critical than highways, railways, power grids or telecom networks were in earlier eras. I made the same argument in my last book, so you can guess where I stand. Excluding the US, sovereign governments have made more than $1 trillion in commitments to AI as infrastructure by 2030. To build such infrastructure inevitably requires historic sums, on a par with the railway and electricity build-outs of the past. McKinsey projects that meeting AI-driven demand by 2030 will require around 156 GW of new electrical capacity — the size of Spain’s and Portugal’s grids combined. The firm estimates this will cost $5-7.9 trillion in capital spending. For context, this is about twenty times the cost of the Apollo missions. This would place AI data centers among the largest infrastructure build-outs in modern history. But useful though infrastructure is, especially when private capital gets involved, things can get divorced from reality. The financing structure matters as much as the technology itself. The railways in the US were largely privately funded and suffered from multiple investment bubbles. Electricity and road systems, by contrast, benefited from greater public investment and coordination, and were less prone to speculative excess. A boom becomes dangerous when the resources it demands start to bend the whole economy around it. Wages get sucked into one sector, supply chains reorient to serve it and capital markets grow dependent on it. The snapback is vicious when expectations break. One way to gauge the economic strain is to look at investment as a share of GDP, the portion of national output funneled into a single technological frontier. It is a crude but telling ratio. It shows how heavily the economy leans on one technological bet. In the case of AI infrastructure, most of that spending takes the form of capital expenditures: the servers, cooling systems, networking gear, shells of concrete and steel and the power infrastructure required to keep them running. By that measure, the railway bubbles were the heaviest. In the United States, railway spending peaked at around 4% of GDP in 1872, just before the first great crash. The telecom boom of the late 1990s, by contrast, topped out near 1% of GDP, a level that looks familiar today. The AI build-out sits in this middle zone. Around $370 billion is expected to flow into data centers globally in 2025, with perhaps 70% earmarked for the US,3 or roughly 0.9% of American GDP. Goldman Sachs projects spending will climb by another 17% in 2026. My own forecasts are in line with this view: annual capex of $800 billion by 2030, perhaps 60% in the US, which would bring the American share to 1.6% of 2025 GDP. The economic-strain gauge has three segments: green up to 1%, amber up to 2% and red above 2%. So today, genAI sits in the green zone – just. Of course, given stated commitments, it looks like it’ll head into amber soon. But there is a twist here that history’s bubbles did not face: rapid depreciation. Once laid, a railway track could last decades. The US was still running freight over 19th-century tracks well into the 20th. Telecom fiber rolled out in the 1990s still carries traffic 35 years later. GPUs, by contrast, age in dog years. Their useful life for frontier applications such as model training is perhaps three years, after which they are relegated to lower-intensity tasks. Roughly a third of hyperscaler capex is going into such short-lived assets. They remain, in theory, monetizable in years five and six. The rest goes into shells, power and cooling that last two or three decades. Adjusting for asset life makes the AI build-out look even more demanding: unlike railroads or fiber, the system must earn its keep in a handful of years, not generations. Whether this dynamic makes financial conditions worse or better is an open question. The pessimistic view is that a box of ripe bananas is worth less than the same value of Brazil nuts, because it must be consumed quickly. But the optimistic case is intriguing: shorter depreciation cycles may impose financial discipline on incoming investors. During the railway mania, decades-long asset lives masked the weakness of many business models; companies could stagger on for years before insolvency. In AI, the flaws may surface quickly, forcing either rapid adaptation or rapid failure. The strain is noticeable but not yet unbearable. Venture funding at the AI application layer, while noisy, remains modest compared with the telecom mania of the 1990s.4 That suggests there may still be running room before the cycle overheats. The trillions pouring into servers, cooling systems and power lines may be essential, but history suggests they are not where the enduring profits accumulate. In railways, many track companies went bust, but the logistics firms and commodity barons riding their lines prospered. In telecoms, it was not the builders of fiber who captured the upside but the platforms and service providers that used the bandwidth. The same logic may apply to AI: hyperscalers shoulder the capex burden, but the durable value may accrue to those who control the models, the data and the ecosystems built on top. This brings us to the second gauge on the dashboard: industry strain. Every boom needs to prove that the money poured into new equipment is starting to earn its keep. In any growth stage, it is unlikely that revenues will cover investment, but they should be non-zero. This gauge looks at the ratio of capex to revenues. We estimate that genAI revenues look on track to exceed $60 billion this year, from roughly nil five years ago.5 This number could well undercount the value being generated by genAI. Meta, for example, has suggested that the technology has increased conversions on its platforms by about 3–5%. Indirect effects like this may help explain why some analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, peg 2025 revenues far higher than our estimate, at $153 billion. The big hyperscalers, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are without doubt moving into a phase of higher capex intensity. In 2021, before ChatGPT, hyperscalers invested about 44% of their operating cash flow in capex. By 2024, that had risen to 68%. In 2025, it will be higher still. But, as Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research points out, these firms can absorb this shift by replatforming, with structurally higher capital intensity driving growth and efficiency gains. This dynamic has been in place for a decade already: between 2015 and 2018, Microsoft Azure’s capex represented between 70% and 90% of revenues. It was an investment in the future. This makes for an interesting comparison to earlier boom cycles. The railroads are particularly pertinent. The railroads’ direct revenue contribution was tiny compared to the value the railroads created in the US economy. Railway bubbles were always tethered to the reality of cash flow. The bonds issued to finance new track and rolling stock had to be serviced out of passenger fares and freight revenues. Whenever capex outpaced earnings, the strain showed. The manias of 1873, 1883 and 1887 all followed the same pattern: a sharp decline in the ratio of annual revenues to capital spending, and in some cases, outright revenue contraction. At the height of the US railroad expansion in 1872, capex was around two times revenues. In the late-1990s telecom bubble, capex amounted to just under four times revenues. By contrast, today’s genAI boom runs on roughly $60 billion in revenues against about $370 billion in global data center capex – a capex-to-revenue ratio of six times, the most stretched of the three.6 On the industry-strain gauge, railways sat healthily in the green. GenAI is in amber, nearing red. It’s not quite a warning sign, not least because genAI has people clamoring for access to AI data centers. One report suggests that enterprise customers are committing to capacity before data centers are even built. What is driving that is usage, and with that comes astonishing revenue growth. The problem in the railroad and telecom booms was not sector strain per se, but that revenues ran out of momentum. Investment expects a return. After the railway bubble burst in 1873, revenue declined by 3% year over year. Telecoms did slightly better, declining 0.5%. Before the crashes, revenue growth was hardly explosive. Railways in 1873 expanded 22% – enough to double in three years. Telecom in the late 1990s managed only 16%, a doubling time of just over four years. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating. By our estimates, genAI revenues will grow about twofold this year.7 And this is likely a conservative forecast. Citi estimates that model makers’ revenue will grow 483% in 2025. OpenAI forecasts annualized growth of about 73% to 2030, while analysts like Morgan Stanley estimate this market could be as large as $1 trillion by 2028, equivalent to compound growth of ~122% a year over the period. Our revenue growth gauge is an exponential one. It measures revenue doubling time in years; that is, at current growth rates, how long does it take for sector revenue to double? Here, genAI sits squarely in the green, doubling every year. Much of this spending flows down to the hyperscalers and neoclouds that run the infrastructure. Hyperscalers make tons of money, so they can afford to invest, trimming a few points off earnings if they think it positions them well for the future. Oracle projects that its cloud business could generate around $380 billion in cumulative revenues by 2030. In my conversations with large companies, I get the strong sense that they can’t get enough of this technology right now. And this likely supports the strong growth rates. IBM’s CEO survey shows that genAI is already expanding IT budgets, with 62% of respondents indicating they will increase their AI investments in 2025. Demand is so high that new data centers are at full utilization as soon as they come online, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noting that “as fast as we put the capacity in, it’s being consumed” and Sam Altman remarking that a lack of compute was affecting model upgrades. Jensen Huang expected this would happen early in 2024, predicting that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell chips would outstrip supply well into next year. Some 9% of US firms have one useful genAI use case. Back-of-the-napkin math suggests that 9% will become 75% within five years, and the number of use cases will rise from one to hundreds.8 That on its own points to a thousandfold increase in something. I say *something* because the current billing-by-token model may change.9 Even if it doesn’t, we’ll see dramatic price declines on per-token pricing, likely by orders of magnitude. The underlying point is that we are still at the foothills of enterprise use. For now, firms can barely secure enough tokens to meet their needs. The consumer side tells a parallel story. US consumers already spend about $1.4 trillion a year online. This could plausibly double to $3 trillion by 2030 if it grows at 15–17% a year (it has grown at more than 14% a year since 2013). Against this backdrop, a genAI app sector rising from today’s $10 billion to $500 billion within five years looks less far-fetched. Exponential growth rates of 300-500% are already visible in mid-sized startups and the large model providers (see last week’s essay on OpenAI’s valuation), suggesting that even a small reallocation of consumer digital spending could drive revenues into the hundreds of billions. Taken together, these signals point to an industry still in strong ascent, unlike the relatively meager revenue growth that preceded the railroad and telecom busts. If genAI revenues were to grow at even half the pace of last year, then, on my conservative forecast, they would reach $100 billion by 2026, covering about 25% of that year’s capex. If economic and industry strain show the weight of the boom and revenue growth its trajectory, valuation heat is the mood of the market. This is often where bubbles reveal themselves most clearly: how exuberantly investors are pricing the sector, regardless of fundamentals. As Carlota Perez has argued for decades, financial markets tend to overshoot in the early “installation phase” of each technological revolution, pouring in capital far beyond what near-term revenues justify. The frenzy looks irrational in the moment, but it is the mechanism by which society lays down the new infrastructure. The challenge is whether the frenzy can evolve into the “deployment phase,” when the infrastructure becomes universal and delivers real productivity gains. The dot-com bubble is the archetype. Companies with no profits at all floated at triple-digit multiples, some raising more on IPO day than they would ever earn in revenues. Boo.com raised $135 million from investors, including LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, and pitched itself as the “Amazon of fashion.” The site launched in 18 countries with localized language and shipping, with a virtual avatar, “Miss Boo,” who gave shopping tips on 3D models. It spent $25 million on advertising before launch, ballooned staff from 40 to 400, and opened plush offices across New York and Europe. The JavaScript- and Flash-heavy website was nearly unusable on dial-up connections, incompatible with Mac computers and buggy. One in four attempted purchases failed. Despite the extravagance – lavish parties, Concorde flights and celebrity stylists for Miss Boo – polls showed that just 13% of internet users knew the brand existed. Within 18 months, the money was gone. Boo.com collapsed in May 2000.10 What’s going on in genAI does not compare to this. The key measure here is the price/earnings ratio (P/E), a shorthand for how many years of current profits an investor is effectively paying for. If a company has $1 in annual earnings and trades at a P/E of 20, buyers are paying $20 for each dollar of current profit, assuming growth will make that worthwhile. A high P/E means companies are betting on rapid future growth, but too high, for too long, investors might be buying into a fantasy. This was the case in the dot-com era. At the peak, the Nasdaq traded at a P/E of about 72. One detailed study estimated that internet stocks alone carried an implied P/E of 605. In other words, investors were willing to pay for more than six centuries of current earnings. The issue wasn’t that demand disappeared – Amazon’s revenues grew from $2.76 billion in 2000 to $3.12 billion in 2001 – but that no company could grow fast enough to justify those sky-high expectations. The fundamentals improved, but expectations collapsed. Today, the picture is much calmer. The Nasdaq P/E is about 32, half that of the dot-com era. The broader tech market is higher than the long-run average, but nowhere near dot-com territory. Compared to the railroad bubbles, which had an estimated P/E of around 20, it is high. But the railroads ended badly, not because valuations were extreme in themselves, but because revenue growth faltered. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating rapidly. Another indicator of valuation excess that many investors pay attention to is the so-called “Buffett Indicator”, which measures how far ahead of GDP equity market valuations have risen. There is no doubt that this indicator is peaky, well above a two-standard-deviation anomaly that often presages market corrections. We are more sanguine, for the moment. History rhymes; it doesn’t repeat. The Buffett indicator relies on GDP, and GDP is famously bad at capturing technological productivity gains. In addition, a large portion of big tech revenues comes from outside the US, decoupling their earnings from domestic GDP. Finally, AI-based productivity may affect margins – keeping output (and GDP constant), while increasing corporate profits. So while we keep an eye on the Buffett indicator (and its distant cousin, the Shiller CAPE ratio), we feel the different dynamics of an accelerating digital economy are not well captured by them. So how hot is this gauge? My verdict is green. Prices haven’t yet broken free of gravity in the way dot-com valuations did. Funding quality is not a standard metric but a composite judgment. It asks who the money is coming from, how it is structured and whether the capital is willing to wait years for returns or rather chase quarterly pops. Low-quality capital, in short, is short-termist, undisciplined and debt-laden; it rushes and flees quickly. High-quality capital is more patient, better underwritten, and able to withstand volatility. Every bubble has its signature weakness, invariably rooted in how it was financed. Railways were fueled by speculative retail investors with little capital behind them. By the early 1870s, funded debt averaged 46% of total assets among American railroads; when overbuilding met a credit squeeze, financing evaporated. The Panic of 1873 sent rail lines into receivership. Dot-com firms, a century later, were a little sturdier. Venture capital was a boutique business in 1995, with only $5.3 billion deployed. By 2001, more than $237 billion had been poured into startups, often by new and inexperienced managers. The frenzy spilled into public markets: IPO volume between 1999 and 2000 ran six times above historical averages. Companies went public with little revenue. Two of my friends took theGlobe.com public in 1998 and enjoyed a 606% share-price pop the day they went public. Telecoms in the late 1990s leaned on mountains of cheap debt. US and European carriers doubled and quadrupled their leverage in just a few years. Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom together added $78 billion in net debt between 1998 and 2001. When revenues failed to keep pace, defaults rippled through the sector. In each case, the capital that fueled the boom proved ephemeral. But the degree of fragility differed. Railways and telecoms were most exposed to credit crunches, with debt ratios ballooning. Dot-coms were hostage to market mood, with equity values evaporating. On this front, today’s AI boom looks sturdier. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are minting extraordinary cash flows, easily enough to bankroll their own build-out. For now. But investment needs are racing ahead. Morgan Stanley reckons total global data center capex will hit $2.9 trillion between 2025 and 2028. Hyperscalers can cover perhaps half of that from internal cash. The rest must come from private credit, securitized finance and new operators. Governments have also pledged $1.6 trillion in sovereign AI investments, and Gulf capital is seeking new opportunities. Here is where the risks creep in. Morgan Stanley itself points to a $1.5 trillion gap that will need to be plugged by debt markets and asset-backed securities. The sums are enormous: $800 billion from private credit, $150 billion in data center ABS,11 and hundreds of billions more in OEM loans and vendor financing.12 That $150 billion alone would triple the size of the data-center securitized markets almost overnight. And not every borrower looks like Microsoft. Consider CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed upstart now going public with $8 billion of debt. It has already slipped into technical default on loans, missing covenants without being insolvent, and its revenues depend on just two customers. Its economics rest on renting GPUs that depreciate by 20–30% per year, more like a WeWork lease than a hyperscaler’s durable balance sheet. In other words, the foundation is stronger than in past bubbles, but the superstructure is starting to resemble the old pattern. Esoteric debt structures, concentrated counterparties and hardware that may not hold value are reappearing. If genAI revenues grow tenfold, creditors will be fine. If not, they may discover that a warehouse full of obsolete GPUs is a difficult thing to secure. For now, my gauge is greenish. We’re not yet in bubble territory, but if financing keeps creeping this way over the next year without revenue growth as robust as 2025’s, it might tick over to amber. On the basis of these gauges, genAI remains in a demand-led, capital-intensive boom rather than a bubble. But booms can sour quickly, and there are several pressure points worth watching: If investment climbs toward 2% of GDP, it could suggest the economy is overweighting AI relative to its productivity returns; equally, if one or more hyperscalers were to cut capex by more than a fifth over the next three to five years, that would mark a sharp turn in sentiment that could trigger a rapid decline among other players. A sustained fall in current enterprise and consumer spending levels would be another warning, especially if foreshadowed by a shrinking Nvidia order backlog. At the same time, the economics need to improve: revenues per dollar of capital should move toward the 0.5–1.0 range. Should the gap fail to close, it would imply that scale is not delivering the expected efficiencies. If valuations start approaching a P/E ratio of 50-60, it would look frothy, since a genuine growth phase should see earnings catching up with prices, not lagging further behind. If internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, data center investment stability comes under pressure. Right now, stability comes from hyperscalers’ strong cash flows. If they stop covering the majority of capex, then more debt and securitization will creep in. Not great given a GPU’s depreciation cycle. If internal funding slips below a quarter of new capex and reliance shifts toward debt and securitization, the sector’s dependence on short-lived GPUs and its exposure to higher interest rates could quickly become destabilizing. My current heuristic is that if two of the five gauges head into red, you’re in bubble territory. Time to sell up, buy the VIX and take some deep breaths. In the year prior to the Panic of 1873, the railroad’s economic strain turned red, accompanied by a decline in funding quality. Anemic revenue growth didn’t help. With the telecoms crash of 2001, revenue growth and funding quality blared red. In the dot-com era, it was industry investment strain and valuations. GenAI isn’t there yet. Racing fast, the engine is whining, but not overheating. How long would it take for two gauges to get into the red? I’ve toyed around with combinations, and most scary scenarios take a couple of years to play out. (And not all scenarios are scary.) That said, so many macro factors, from a recession in the US, to rising inflation, a challenging interest-rate environment, and domestic or international politics, could dampen spirits. While we might not be solidly in bubbleland, it would be hubristic to assume the AI investment cycle is immune to those exuberant dynamics. Onward. For now. Share I even wrote a blurb on the 1999 book The Internet Bubble. Edward Chancellor’s book on bubbles is a useful guide. Last year, SemiAnalysis forecast that around 70% of data center capacity build-out will happen in the US over the medium term. Adjusted for inflation, VC investment in the internet in 2000 was $85.9 billion; Dealroom.co reports $47 billion for the AI application layer last year – a difference of $38.9 billion. Revenues are compiled from primary corporate disclosures (SEC filings, earnings transcripts, investor presentations, press releases) and supplemented by analyst and consultancy estimates (McKinsey, Gartner, IDC, etc.) where company reporting is incomplete. We prioritize disclosed figures, adjust for potential double-counting in revenue-sharing agreements (e.g., OpenAI–Microsoft), and categorize revenue streams (subscription, API, infrastructure, licensing) to maintain comparability. Private-company revenues (e.g., Anthropic, Midjourney) rely on reported run-rates or credible press/VC sources, flagged as estimates. See previous footnote for genAI revenue model. Railroads calculated from FRED data and telecoms from OECD data on US leased line revenues. Our model shows 130% growth among AI companies year over year. Starting from about six million US firms, assume 9% (about 540,000) now have one useful genAI use case; project adoption to 75% (about 4.5 million) within five years, and average use cases per adopting firm to rise from about 1 to about 100 – yielding roughly 450 million use cases, an increase of about 830 times; illustrative, not a forecast. Most genAI services today are billed “by the token.” A token is a unit of text, usually about four characters or ¾ of a word. Customers are charged for tokens processed in prompts and responses (for example, a 1,000-word output might equal ~1,300 tokens). This model directly links cost to usage, but it may evolve as enterprises negotiate flat-rate contracts, consumption bundles, or outcome-based pricing. I spent an afternoon walking through Boo’s deserted offices after the collapse to see if any physical assets retained value. Asset-backed securities are bonds sold to investors, backed by cash flows from a pool of underlying assets. In this case, the assets are data center leases or infrastructure contracts, allowing operators to raise capital by securitizing predictable rental or service revenues. OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Dell, Cisco or Nvidia often extend credit to customers or partner with financing arms to help them buy hardware. Vendor financing is the broader term for suppliers lending to buyers, typically repaid out of the revenues generated from using the purchased equipment. First of all, thanks for the reference to my work in your thoughtful, balanced and all but comprehensive analysis. There is one further aspect of these transformational technologies that are deployed as network-based services. This is the pricing dynamics when (a) the ability to deliver the first unit of service requires very large capital investment and (2) the marginal cost of delivering incremental units of services is very low. Then, marginal cost will be below average cost and – under competitive conditions – price will tend to be driven towards marginal cost. The result, of course, is negative cash flow for all competitors which, in turn, incentivizes some mix of regulatory intervention to protect the competitors from each other (ICC, PUCs) and evolution towards oligopoly/monopoly. I gather that inklings of these dynamics can be seen in the decline of cost/price per token. I am very interested in your take on this issue when it comes to roll out of the foundational models at increasing scale. -- Bill Janeway You certainly are right to mobilize demand elasticity as the counter MC<AC. But token cost is not the full cost of AI deployment. Given the probabilistic nature of the LLM token-prediction process, applications will vary by the intensity of the need for human supervision, debugging, etc. I don’t know how representative this RCT was, but it did strike me as suggesting a somewhat more complicated scenario: https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/ .

Join thousands of innovation leaders getting weekly insights Why James Mackintosh's defense of quarterly reporting ignores what actually happens in corporate boardrooms. James Mackintosh's recent Wall Street Journal piece defending quarterly earnings reporting reads like a textbook example of why academic analysis often misses the mark when it comes to understanding corporate behavior. As someone who lived this reality for years as Chief Technology Officer at Hewlett-Packard—the world's largest technology company at the time by revenue with massive R&D investments—I can tell you the quarterly reporting system creates perverse incentives that systematically undermine long-term innovation. Mackintosh's central argument rests on flawed premises and cherry-picked data that ignore the lived experience of corporate executives who actually make investment decisions under quarterly pressure. His dismissal misses a critical opportunity to address one of America's most significant competitive disadvantages. Let me share what quarterly reporting actually looks like from the inside. During my tenure as CTO at HP, I experienced how quarterly pressure created systematic patterns across the industry where R&D would be paused, or delayed during quarter-end periods. This became a predictable cycle that repeated quarter after quarter. This behavior wasn’t unique to HP. It's the inevitable result of a system that rewards short-term financial engineering over patient capital investment. When your stock price can swing dramatically based on missing earnings by a few cents per share, the rational response is to optimize for quarterly performance, even at the expense of long-term competitiveness. The academic research Mackintosh cites, including MIT's Robert Pozen's study of UK reporting changes, fundamentally misunderstands how corporate behavior evolves. These researchers have never sat in a boardroom where directors debate whether to continue funding a multi-year innovation project that won't generate revenue for 36 months while facing pressure to meet next quarter's numbers. They've never experienced the intense scrutiny from analysts who penalize any hint of reduced short-term profitability. Through my relationship with Alex Mandl—my former boss at Teligent who led the board negotiations to take Dell private—I witnessed the most compelling modern example. Michael Dell and Silver Lake paid $24.9 billion for one thing—freedom from the quarterly earnings pressure that was killing Dell Technologies long-term potential. Dell explicitly stated the goal was "no more pulling R&D and growth investments to make in-quarter numbers." R&D spending increased from $1.1 billion to $4.4 billion, transforming Dell from declining PC manufacturer to enterprise solutions leader. The result: an estimated $70 billion return by 2023. This wasn't theoretical—it was a $25 billion bet that quarterly reporting pressure was destroying long-term value. And they were proven spectacularly right. Mackintosh's reliance on the UK's 2014 experience with optional quarterly reporting reveals a critical flaw in his reasoning. He argues that because UK companies didn't dramatically change their investment behavior after switching to semi-annual reporting, quarterly reporting must not be problematic. This ignores a fundamental truth: we've trained an entire generation of CEOs, CFOs, and board members to think in 90-day cycles. You don't undo decades of conditioning overnight. When business schools teach earnings management, when compensation systems reward quarterly performance, and when analysts' careers depend on predicting short-term results, making reporting optional doesn't suddenly transform corporate culture. The UK comparison is meaningless without addressing the broader ecosystem that reinforces short-term thinking. Mackintosh points to Big Tech's massive AI investments as proof that quarterly reporting doesn't hinder long-term thinking. This argument reveals a profound misunderstanding of competitive dynamics. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta can hide enormous R&D expenditures within their massive profit margins. When you're generating 20-30% operating margins on hundreds of billions in revenue, you can afford to invest $50 billion in speculative technologies while still meeting quarterly expectations. But what about companies in lower-margin industries? What about manufacturing firms, healthcare companies, or emerging technology businesses that can't disguise innovation investments as easily? The current system creates a two-tier economy where only the most profitable companies can afford to think long-term, while everyone else gets trapped in quarterly optimization cycles. America's competitive advantage has always been rooted in our ability to make patient, long-term investments in breakthrough technologies. The semiconductor industry, the internet, biotechnology, and countless other innovations emerged from companies willing to invest for decades before seeing returns. Today's quarterly reporting regime systematically discourages this kind of "patient innovation." I've written extensively about the concept of the "50-year overnight success"—the reality that truly transformative innovations require sustained investment over multiple decades. Companies need the freedom to pursue breakthrough technologies without explaining every quarter why they're spending money on projects that won't generate revenue for years. Do I think switching from quarterly to semi-annual reporting solves the problem? No. Six months isn't meaningfully different from three months when it comes to long-term thinking. But we can make meaningful reforms that would help: First, eliminate forward-looking earnings guidance. This practice forces companies to make public commitments about future performance, creating enormous pressure to meet those predictions regardless of changing circumstances. Second, create accounting treatments that allow companies to separate long-term innovation investments from operational expenses, giving investors clearer visibility into both current performance and future potential. Third, develop new metrics and incentives that reward patient capital deployment and long-term value creation, not just quarterly financial performance. This isn't an abstract policy debate—it's about America's economic future. While we optimize for quarterly performance, competitors in China and other nations are making massive, sustained investments in critical technologies. Their state-directed approach has significant flaws, as Mackintosh correctly notes, but at least they're thinking in decade-long time horizons. We need American companies to have the same freedom to pursue patient innovation without facing quarterly punishment from investors and analysts who fundamentally misunderstand the innovation process. Academic researchers and financial journalists can theorize all they want about efficient markets and rational behavior. Those of us who've actually run large corporations know better. The quarterly reporting system is broken, and defending it based on theoretical models and incomplete data serves no one except those who profit from short-term volatility. Next time the Wall Street Journal wants to analyze corporate behavior, perhaps they should talk to someone who's actually lived it. The American economy deserves better than academic theory masquerading as practical wisdom.

Title: One Big Beautiful Bubble: Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta Platforms, Palantir et al in the danger zone?

Compare this to a single stock – Oracle Corporation adding $255 billion to its market cap within few hours on September 10! The message from investors is clear: The AI mania is running up and strong. The software giant grabbed headlines when its shares gained 36 per cent on September 10. With this massive move up, the stock added over $255 billion to its market cap – joining the exclusive club of stocks that have gained $250 billion or more in a single day. Other members of the coveted club are Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft. What triggered this euphoria in Oracle shares? The company had reported results for Q1 FY26 on September 9 after market close. However, it wasn’t earnings that pleased the street. While its net profit came in line with expectations, revenue reported a slight miss. What, in fact, surprised the street was the company’s grand plans for scaling up its cloud infrastructure business, a whopping 14 times by FY30 – from $10.2 billion in revenue in FY25 to $144 billion. In other words, this is a compounded growth rate of 70 per cent between FY25 and FY30. As the AI race continues full steam, it appears Oracle doesn’t want to be left behind. With large language models (LLMs) being built and upgraded left, right and centre, there is heavy demand for data centres that have the compute (processing power) to support this. This is exactly where Oracle and its cloud infrastructure business come in. The company offers cloud-based compute, storage and networking services to clients. Simply put, clients can make use of Oracle’s high-performance cloud servers to deploy applications based on AI. During the said quarter, the company signed multiple multi-year, multi-billion-dollar contracts (largely under the cloud infrastructure vertical), taking the RPO (remaining performance obligations) figure to $455 billion, which is all the more the main reason for the rally. Readers can understand RPO as order backlog for now. This is a rise of 359 per cent year on year and 230 per cent quarter on quarter. RPO is further expected to reach $500 billion in the next few months. For context, Oracle’s FY25 revenue was $57.4 billion. Though the company is making the right moves to make the most of AI-led demand, there are a few factors that are noteworthy here. First, RPOs represent contracted revenue that is yet to be recognised. Revenue can be recognised only if Oracle could discharge its contractual obligations when the time comes. Thus the $455-billion RPO is not an absolute guarantee that it would translate to future revenue. Contract cancellations and unfavourable modifications to the contract terms could result in material write-down of RPOs. Second, Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle has struck a $300-billion deal with OpenAI, likely spanning over five years from 2027. Now, looking at this in tandem with the $455-billion RPO figure, it leads one to believe that much of the future revenue is tied to one single client – giving room for concentration risk. What is even more concerning is the fact that OpenAI is a cash-burning start-up, run on venture capital, with about $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, per media reports. Third, while the company appears to have a robust road-map for the cloud infrastructure business, there isn’t relatively as much clarity as to the future of the rest of the businesses. Currently, the cloud infrastructure business accounts for just 17 per cent of overall revenue based on FY25. In the last five quarters, this vertical has clocked year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of 51 per cent on average. This, while the rest of the verticals have grown at a mere 2.5 per cent. While such concerns linger, the market’s reaction appears premature and running ahead of fundamentals. Even in the last five years, the company’s execution record has not been strong relative to its stock price performance. On an absolute basis, while earnings have grown 23 per cent on an absolute basis over that of FY20, stock price during the same period has risen close to 400 per cent. Even before the 36 per cent jump last week, the stock was trading at a trailing PE of 54x, which is not inexpensive. As of September 19, it trades at a PE of 69x. All things considered, this very simply reflects investors’ euphoric bet on anything linked to AI. But is it turning into a bubble, one that is reminiscent of the dotcom bust? Before addressing the pertinent question, investors first need to understand the sheer size of economic interest involved in the ongoing AI race. Here’s some crazy statistic. Since January 2020, the market cap of the S&P 500 index has risen $31 trillion. On another hand, the top 10 AI stocks, that are part of the index, have added $18 trillion to their combined market cap. These include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Oracle, Broadcom and Palantir. This is saying, the worth of just 2 per cent of the index’s stocks have grown equivalent to 60 per cent of the index’s gains, while the rest 98 per cent got the short end of the stick (40 per cent). Also, currently, the market cap of these stocks put together is as large as 40 per cent of S&P 500’s market cap. Further, the current AI surge demands unprecedented capital expenditure, as companies compete to build the computational infrastructure. These include real estate for data centres, the cutting-edge GPUs and related cooling systems and network hardware. In the past few years, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle (in descending order of quantum of capex; referred to as Big 5 in this article) have been large spenders on capex. Together, the Big 5 have invested an aggregate of $586 billion over the last three fiscals. They are expected to incur about $860 billion in the next two years. This is almost as big as how much the US spends on defence every year. Historically, the Big 5 have been asset-light businesses. However, with capex picking up lately, their combined fixed assets turnover ratio (only tangible assets considered) has gradually declined year on year to almost half of what it was 10 years ago — from 4.6 times to 2.2 times now. To put it in perspective, if one were to assign the multiple of 4.6x to the capex expected to be incurred in 2025 – about $400 billion (see chart), the expectation is that there should be an incremental revenue of $1,850 billion. However, the combined revenue of the Big 5 in the recently-concluded fiscal was only about $1,500 billion and it has taken decades since these companies were incorporated to reach such a scale. Even at the lower end of the multiple – at 2.2 times, incremental revenue required out of the capex would work out to $880 billion by end of FY25. For context, the combined revenue of the cloud verticals of the Big 5 is just about $250 billion today. Even if one were to assume that incremental revenue will kick in with a lag, the argument does come across as a hard sell, especially with these figures. Another statistic that brings out how big the AI capex has become for the economy is the one from the US’ Bureau of Economic Analysis. It measures the contribution of segments of the economy to the overall GDP every quarter. For example, if the GDP growth (real) rate during the quarter is 3 per cent and the contribution of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) reads 1 per cent, then it means that PCE has contributed to a third of incremental GDP. Similarly, for the recently-concluded quarter (Q2 2025), GDP growth was 3.3 per cent, but contribution of gross private domestic investment came in at -2.7 per cent. However, contribution of investment in information processing equipment and software (tech capex), which form part of gross private domestic investment, stood at 0.8 per cent. This shows that despite a slowdown in the overall private capex in the economy, tech capex has stood resilient. For lack of further detailed classification, information processing equipment and software have been considered here, which can be safely assumed to be substantially driven by the ongoing AI, data centre capex. If one were to construct a two-quarter moving average line of this contribution to GDP measure, in the recent quarter, the contribution of tech capex to GDP (1.1 per cent) has, in fact, surpassed the contribution of PCE to GDP (0.7 per cent) for the first time, in the quarters analysed since 2022. This is big, especially when you consider the fact that PCE accounts for about 70 per cent of US’ GDP. Considering the above pointers, it is quite clear that the AI mania is now just too big to fail. Whether it is the wealth effect and its consequent positive impact on economic growth or their hard capex driving a good chunk of the economy or the investor sentiment riding upon these companies, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that expected revenues start flowing in. Looking ahead, AI is still an evolving technology and so, the picture looks murky today. One, there isn’t yet concrete evidence proving efficiency gains from use of AI would be attractive and cost effective enough to drive healthy adoption in enterprises. Two, while LLMs are being trained by spending on bleeding edge GPUs, there are noticeable positive developments with smaller models that wouldn’t require as much compute as LLMs, sometimes possible even without GPUs – raising the question as to what is the right level of capex. Three, today broadly AI is being used in applications such as summarisation, generative media, transcription and others – where the AI models do not appear to stand differentiated from one another. Sure, AI has found use-cases such as support services, pharmaceutical research and so on. However, the single most important application for AI in the next decade – which could be robotics or autonomous driving, for example, are not yet on the horizon when it comes to mass deployment. On considering the above, the valuations of top AI stocks today are not cheap, with all except Nvidia and Amazon trading at PE ratios above five-year averages. Palantir’s market cap is $433 billion, while its revenue is just $2.9 billion. Outside the top 10, stocks like AMD, ARM Holdings trade at PE ratios of 86x and 172x respectively. CoreWeave, a recently-listed cloud services company, is yet to turn profitable but is a $61-billion unit, with revenue and net loss of $1.9 billion and $863 million (FY24). In the unlisted space, AI start-ups are raking in capital from VC/PE funds at lofty valuations. Entities from within the AI value chain have become backers in some cases. Case in point, Microsoft’s, Amazon’s and ASML’s investment in OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral respectively. All three are cash-burning start-ups valued at about $300 billion, $180 billion and $14 billion respectively (per known latest funding rounds). This exuberance does make one reminiscent of the infamous dotcom bubble of 2000 – when anything that had ‘Internet’ stamped on it was selling like hot cakes, even at unreasonable valuations. Right before the bubble burst in March 2000, the S&P 500 reached a PE ratio of 29.5x – never to see a rerating to such levels until April 2021, which too lasted only briefly. Today, its PE is reasonably close to such levels at 26x. However, the current market cap (of S&P 500) to GDP ratio stands at 2x, much worse than about 1.3x in March 2000. Even on a forward earnings basis, the index and almost all top AI stocks trade at PEG (price to earnings growth) ratios of over 2x, which appear unsustainable, all things considered. Though AI presents a structural opportunity to bet on, investors need to be extremely watchful of valuations as they can make all the difference. Investors will be better served waiting for now, in search of better entry points with higher margin of safety. As the AI craze continues to heat up, it is worth pondering on this quote from John Hussman, a fund manager who was prescient in his prediction of the dot com crash: Valuations often matter suddenly, and with a vengeance. This is a lesson best learnt before a crash rather than after one. In the interest of how much depends on AI investment and wealth effect, one will have to hope this time is truly different!

Title: Wrong time for dollar diversification

The advice doing the rounds that Indian investors ought to go big on US stocks to avoid ‘losing money’ from rupee depreciation, is the latest example. Their arguments are on the following lines. # If you’ve earned an 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from your domestic equity funds in the last five years, don’t be too happy. After adjusting for rupee depreciation, your returns are just 13 per cent. The rupee has been losing 3-4 per cent against the US dollar for the last many decades. The only way to shield your portfolio from this is to invest in US markets. # The AI revolution is sweeping the world. As AI replaces humans across industries, many Indian industries will be disrupted. Stay safe by investing in US Magnificent 7 companies. There’s a grain of truth in each of these statements; but it’s no more than a grain. If you’re thinking of making a wholesale switch from Indian stocks to the US ones, look before you leap. Investing a small portion of your portfolio in dollar-denominated assets to fund your overseas expenditure is a good idea. But this is a particularly bad time to replace your Indian equity allocations with US equities, hoping to earn a higher return or gain from dollar appreciation. Let’s first look at why Indian investors need to stick with rupee assets. Buy what you know: Globally, even professional and institutional investors have a home-country bias. That is, they invest the bulk of their portfolio in assets denominated in the currency of their home country. US investors stick by dollar assets and Chinese investors prefer yuan-denominated assets. This is quite simply because you get the best results from investing in what you understand. An Indian investor has a greater shot at understanding and tracking the Indian economy, consumers, companies and government policy, than the US economy, its consumers or government policy. When professional investors or institutions invest outside their home country, they think of this as a risk and hedge against it. USD weakening: It is also dangerous to expect the dollar to deliver 3-4 per cent gains against the rupee like clockwork. Yes, over the last three decades, the rupee has lost ground against the dollar at a 3-4 per cent annualised rate. This is because India has consistently run a current account deficit and needed foreign capital inflows to fund it. But there’s no guarantee that rupee depreciation will continue at this rate to perpetuity. If a shrinking current account deficit, a healthy economy, improving sovereign ratings or attractive stock valuations or bond yields woo back foreign investors to India, this can slow the pace of rupee depreciation. In fact, the dollar index is down 10 per cent since the beginning of 2025, on tariff turbulence and rate cut expectations. US policymakers are, today, keen to allow the dollar to weaken substantially, so that US exports can be made more competitive. Mirror your expenses: The basic purpose of financial planning is to fund your future expenses. If your future expenses such as buying a home or setting up a pension fund are going to be in rupees, your investments need to be rupee-denominated too. Yes, rupee depreciation can indirectly peg up your expenses if imported goods such as crude oil, gold, industrial metals or edible oils get costlier. But all this gets captured in domestic inflation numbers. As long as you plan your investments to beat inflation, the currency impact on your daily expenses is taken care of. You need dollar assets in your portfolio only to the extent of financial goals that will entail spending in dollars. If you plan to tour the US, enrol in a US master’s programme, pursue higher education for your child in American universities, that portion of your portfolio needs to be invested in dollar assets. Switching from Indian stocks to US stocks today, based on valuation concerns, is akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Here’s why. * As the Indian market has enjoyed a breathless bull run since Covid, the US market has rallied right alongside it. In the five years to September 2025, while the Nifty50 has gained 120 per cent, Nasdaq100 Index is up 127 per cent and US S&P 500 112 per cent. Yes, Indian markets have turned expensive after this rally with the Nifty50 at a 22 PE and the Nifty500 at 25. But then so has the US market, which now appears over-valued by most metrics. The Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP) for the US hovers at 217 per cent against the fair level of 100 per cent. S&P index’ trailing PE of 26 times is well above the long-term average of 18. The forward PE of 25 stacks up against the long-term average of 17. Therefore, if Indian stocks can get derated on earnings disappointments, so can US stocks. * After a post-Covid boom, the Indian economy has normalised to 6.5-7 per cent growth rate. The US economy is, however, on the verge of a sharp slowdown. Last week, US Fed members projected that GDP growth could slow down to 1.6 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 from 2.8 per cent in 2024. With government spending cuts, US jobs growth has fallen off a cliff in recent months with monthly non-farm payrolls averaging 29,000 in June-August 2025 against 82,000 same time last year. The impact of these job losses on consumer spending and the economy is yet to play out. It is hard to believe at this juncture that tariff flip-flops, job losses and the spending slowdown that follows will have no impact on US corporate earnings. Whether Fed rate cuts will make up for all this remains to be seen. * Unlike the Indian government, which has been cutting back on borrowings post-Covid, the US has been binge-borrowing, with its debt at $37 trillion and debt-GDP ratio at over 120 per cent now. US bond market yields have been highly volatile in the last one year and are at present above the levels at which they were when the Federal Reserve started cutting rates in September 2024. Rising bond yields ratchet up the cost of borrowings for the US government and companies, and can spook capital flows. Global central banks have been diversifying away from the dollar into gold holdings in recent times. * A popular argument for investing in US equities is that no other market offers the opportunity to own a piece of global hyper-scalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Amazon. This is true. The Magnificent Seven, thanks to their technological prowess and the global dominance of their platforms, have managed scorching growth rates in revenues, profits and cash flows over the past decade. In recent years, they have invested eye-watering sums in AI capex, building up hopes that rising AI adoption will drive the next leg of supernormal growth for these companies. It is thanks to these expectations that the market capitalisation of Magnificent 7 stocks has rocketed to $21 trillion, nearly five times India’s GDP. Just seven stocks now make up 34 per cent of US stock market capitalisation. Mag 7 stocks have belted out a 38 per cent CAGR in the last 10 years. But after a decade of scorching earnings growth and even more scorching stock price performance, some market veterans are beginning to question if the hyper-scaler story has been stretched too far. There are worries about whether AI monetisation will lag capex, and if Mag 7 companies will end up decimating both their cash flows and shareholder returns in their pursuit of GenAI. Comparisons are beginning to be made to the infamous 1999-2000 dotcom bubble (See Big Story). Therefore, Indian investors who need dollar exposures in their portfolio because of specific goals, should explore stocks outside the Mag 7 and gold at this juncture. Others should stick to Indian equities and bide their time on overseas diversification. Published on September 20, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: This Week in Games - Nintendo September Direct 2025

Welcome back, folks! I hope everyone enjoyed my cameo appearance in This Week in Anime yesterday. I'd have made a cute segue for it in last week's column, but things were arranged a bit too late for that. It's always nice to collaborate with Steve, Coop, and Chris, especially when I can chat about topics I'm familiar with. I got to meet Chris in person for the first time a few weeks back; he's just as charming as his writing. We were also able to meet up with fellow This Week in Anime alums Nicky. Good times were had by all! Today, though, we're covering a ton of news—so let's begin. People sure love tempting the Persona 5 curse. You'd think after Star Ocean: anamnesis, Dragalia Lost and the Fullmetal Alchemist gacha, folks would have a bit of trepidation about collaborating with Persona 5. Oh well! Here comes Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has had a lot of collaborations with Japanese media lately, and they've been hit-or-miss. The One-Punch Man outfits didn't look great, and the Cowboy Bebop collab was all right (given some weird faces). This time, the suits look pretty good. Mercy as Panther/Ana actually looks pretty great, and I can't fault any of the other choices (D.Va as Queen/Makoto, Genji as Skull/Ryuji, Wuyang as Joker/Akira, and Lifeweaver as Fox/Yusuke). They've even got art from Shigenori Soejima; that's at least as much effort Fortnite would put into one of these. The collab started on September 16; at the time of writing, further details haven't been released. I snark, but the skins look legitimately cool. I might be a bit burnt out at the sight of Persona 5, and Overwatch has never really done anything for me. But kudos to Blizzard for finally getting one of these right. A major surprise dropped into our laps earlier this week with the reveal of two new Game Boy Advance titles added to Nintendo's NSO+ service—and both of them are third-party titles from Bandai Namco! While they were exclusives to Nintendo's old handheld, this opens a lot of fun doors for the NSO+ library. Provided, we might want to keep those reins in check: these likely came about because Nintendo and Bandai Namco have some very close business relations. Those old side-scrollers starring Nickelodeon characters might still be a bridge too far, more's the pity. First up is Mr. Driller, Bandai Namco's long-running puzzle series starring the eponymous miner. The Mr. Driller games are fun, hectic puzzlers: using your drill, you tunnel your way through variously-colored minerals, with entire blocks of like-colored minerals vanishing at once. But as you drill your way through, blocks that aren't affixed to larger blocks will fall behind you, forcing you to keep on digging to keep from getting caught in the cave-in. Complicating things is your oxygen meter: you lose air as you drill, and harder minerals require more effort (and thus more air), forcing you to be careful in choosing your path as you tunnel. It can be a long way between spare air tanks... Mr. Driller has never been a massive hit for Bandai Namco, but the games are fun—especially if you can take them on the go. Also fun is the lore behind the title: canonically, the titular Mr. Driller, Susumu Hori, is the son of Dig-Dug's hero, Taizo Hori. Taizo has even made cameo appearances in other Mr. Driller games! (The mom is Toby Masuyo, protagonist of Baraduke/Alien Sector. According to Namco x Capcom, Toby and Taizo had an acrimonious divorce.) The other game is another attention-nabber: Bandai Namco's beloved Klonoa: Empire of Dreams! I have a soft spot for the Klonoa titles: deceptively deep platformers with stunning presentation and music, and stories that rip your heart out. Empire of Dreams sees the Dream Traveler Klonoa having to clear his name of the crime of "dreaming of adventure." Of course, there's a reason why dreams have been outlawed, and Klonoa is likely to make us shed a few tears as he finds out the truth... Empire of Dreams continues the series' traditional mechanics: Klonoa can jump and flutter around a bit by flapping his cute, floppy ears. Klonoa also has his Wind Ring, which lets him inflate enemies. From there, Klonoa can carry them around, throw them at other enemies, or throw them after jumping to extend his jump. It's basic stuff on paper, but eventually expanded into surprisingly complicated platforming sections. The Klonoa titles might be cute, but 100% completion is a true challenge in those titles. My heart always weeps for Klonoa. We were fortunate enough a few years ago to get the Phantasy Reverie Series back in 2022, and I was luckier still to get to review it. Bandai Namco even teased a possible Klonoa 3 if the collection sold well enough... but it's been three years. At the very least, the Phantasy Reverie Series regularly goes on sale for very cheap; at around $10, these are some of the best platformers you can get your hands on. I'd at least like to hope that Empire of Dreams coming to NSO+ means that the other GBA Klonoa titles are on the table. Dream Champ Tournament is also cute, but Legendary Star Medal never came to the United States. We can only hope for more chances to hear Klonoa's adorable "WA-HOO!" Both of these titles go live on NSO+ this September 25. Last week, I mentioned how Nintendo and Pokémon have become a serious "bitch eating crackers" for the gaming industry and for self-described "Gamers." For folks unfamiliar with the phrase, a "bitch eating crackers" is when you have such dislike for someone that something as innocuous as them eating crackers at the other side of the room ticks you off. I maintain that. Mind you: More than a few decisions in the following Direct did turn me off... but also, I wasn't catastrophizing about this being the worst display of arrogance from a company that "needs to be humbled." Because there wasn't any need to. I worry if I'm the crazy one, but then I read past the headline of an article... With 2025 being the 40th anniversary of the Mario Brothers, Nintendo has arranged for several fun goodies: special art and light displays at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, sponsoring the annual Kyoto Marathon... fun stuff. There was also the news that the Mario Bros. sequel is being developed, and it's going with Super Mario Galaxy. (A lot of folks have pointed out that Old Spice jumped the gun a little and spoiled the reveal with some of their promotional stock that is in stores now. Whoops.) Weird that the movie is going with Galaxy, but considering that none of the other Mario games escalate on the level Galaxy does, I see where they're coming from. Doki Doki Panic has been buried; Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World only really introduce the Koopalings, which aren't enough of a draw; Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine don't really shake up the formula enough, and Illumination still thinks Chris Pratt is more charming than Charlie Day, so that's a no-go on Luigi's Mansion. No word yet on who's playing Princess Rosalina, but Rosalina's storybook (as in, an actual physical representation of it) is for sale on Nintendo's website and set to release this November 25. The real disappointment was the news that Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel are getting a remastered physical release—at full price, US$70. This is following the Super Mario Bros 3D All-Stars, which already included the first Super Mario Galaxy. Let me be clear, I think people have lost their damn minds when it comes to game price discourse. I saw someone comment that Digimon Story: Time Stranger "doesn't look AAA, so it shouldn't be priced like a AAA game," which is a great way of completely disregarding the amount of effort that went into actually producing the game. It is my genuine belief that Steam's firehouse sales have destroyed any semblance of value when it comes to a game; why buy a game at full price when you can get it for 20% off at the Summer Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for 30% off at the Winter Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for $5 at the next Spring Sale? I feel like the effort put into remaking a game top-to-bottom isn't invalidated just because the game was originally released on Game Boy or because you can't see the individual scales on Gomamon's Marching Fishes. That said, US$70 for both Super Mario Galaxy games is where I draw the line. Both of those titles were US$20 on the Wii U! We already had Super Mario Galaxy in the first 3D collection! This is what a piss-take looks like, if you ask me. But this got weirdly ignored following the further news. At any rate, it releases on October 2, with promotional Amiibo (Mario with a Luma, and Rosalina reading a book to several Luma) releasing on April 2. I rather like the Rosalina Luma a lot. I'd rather buy that than the US$70 two-pack. I regret to inform you all that the following news involves tennis. (Cue the clip of Rex Mohs screaming his soul out in disgust.) We're getting a new Mario Tennis game, titled Mario Tennis Fever. The titular gimmick is the fever rackets: tennis rackets that can build up energy over the course of a rally to activate special effects. There are over 30 Fever Rackets, with all sorts of effects like freezing the opponent's side of the court or summoning Mini Mushrooms. There is also a record-breaking amount of characters in Mario Tennis, over 30. There are also a variety of modes, like the standard Tournament mode and online Ranked modes, along with a mode for motion controls or randomized effects on the court ("Mix-It-Up" mode). The Adventure Mode is most intriguing. It's a story mode where the Mario characters are turned into babies and have to relearn tennis skills as they travel through a world. It's a good way to mask a tutorial mode, especially for people who aren't great at tennis simulators. Mario Tennis Fever releases on February 12, 2026, but, y'know, it's tennis without Ultra-Smashes. Super Mario Wonder is also getting a dedicated port on Nintendo Switch 2—but it's not just a graphical update. New features and content were teased, but we won't hear about that until later. The main feature the Direct focused on was the Bellabel Park update, which adds a variety of multiplayer options. A lot of these are actually quite fun as party games. Also, like, if we're getting toys of Nintendo characters, can we get more Yoshi toys? There's so much money left on the table from Nintendo not making a full stable of Yoshi toys. Speaking of the T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas: A thing I appreciate about the Yoshi games is their use of different aesthetics. The original Yoshi's Island was ostensibly a Super Mario World sequel—but it abandoned the look of the original game in favor of a crayonesque design, along with its own unique platforming mechanics (i.e., carrying Baby Mario around). Yoshi's Story wasn't great, but its pop-up book aesthetic still looks pretty good. And so on with other games like Yoshi's Woolly World. So Nintendo's going all-in with Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. With the help of the encyclopedia, Mister E (get it?), Yoshi and his friends must fill out the missing pages. The whole thing is done as a side-scrolling puzzle game, figuring out the various abilities of the creatures Yoshi encounters while using the world around him to move around. The trailer showcased a puzzle where Yoshi had to spread dandelion seeds to erode a boulder that was in his way; that's some good lateral thinking. They'll have a real winner on their hands if they can properly iterate on that kind of stage construction. Also, I like the in-universe aesthetic. It's a bit Super Mario Wonder in its approach, but with undercranked character animations to sell the "illustrated" aesthetic. See, this is the thing I like seeing from Nintendo; it's disappointing that this kind of attention to detail doesn't get its due appreciation. That's not Bill Trinen! Nintendo had a minor once-over for Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream, going over the basics of character creation and care. But there wasn't much else, outside of the confirmation of a Spring 2026 release. The burning question on everyone's mind is whether Living The Dream will actually incorporate gay/lesbian couples. There was a kerfuffle over the original Tomodachi Life on 3DS, since this was impossible then (outside of a glitch). Games have come a long way in the years since, and even other Nintendo games have allowed for more gender-affirming options, such as referring to body types as "styles." And that's before you consider other titles like the Story of Seasons games, allowing for non-gender-locked relationships. It'll be a significant disappointment if Nintendo doesn't follow along. Here's a funny one. Square Enix originally broke away from Nintendo during development of Final Fantasy VII because Nintendo decided upon a cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, and Square Enix (then Squaresoft) had bigger goals in mind for their upcoming title. This was a particularly strong bit for them, so much so that they referenced the matter in their magazine ads. We wouldn't see new Final Fantasy titles on Nintendo consoles for years after that. Anyway, Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is coming to the Nintendo Switch this January 22. The first part of Square's ambitious three-part remake of the original Final Fantasy VII, the "Integrade" update includes new story beats and stages that center around Yuffie, explaining what she was doing before Cloud and company find her in the forest. There might be some graphical compromises, but I feel like those are small potatoes compared to being able to play a game of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade's scope on the go. Speaking of Amiibo! Nintendo has decided to introduce a Smash Bros-style mechanic to Kirby Air Riders wherein you can train Amiibo Figure characters. These characters will learn racing techniques as they play against you, up to and including developing a "personality" based around their experiences racing. So far, we only have Kirby on the Warp Star and Bandana Dee (no need for a middle name here) on the Winged Star. But also: the figures are swappable! You can unplug the riders from their machines, which will come in handy with upcoming Riders and Machines that are being teased. You can expect Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Gooey to come along with certain machines. I lack the experience with Kirby Air Riders to make any educated guess on those. Also, because Sakurai's 40-minute Direct focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders wasn't enough, there's going to be a second one in the near future. More updates on Hyrule Warriors: War of Imprisonment! The gameplay stuff sounds fun, but the most important bit is that it's Gameshare compatible: players will be able to play co-op across two consoles with just one copy of the game, including the original Switch model. It's a great move. I honestly wish more games offered this as a feature by default. Anyway, War of Imprisonment adds some new wrinkles to the Hyrule Warriors formula in the form of Tears of the Kingdom's Zonai tech. Using these ancient artifacts, players can mess with enemy groups or alter the battlefield. I appreciate the puzzle-based addition to the battles. I'm still not crazy for the post-Breath of the Wild Hyrule Warriors games because of the original Hyrule Warriors offering so much, but I can't knock them for actually trying to expand the formula. Few things disappoint me than how the gaming community has left Dragon Quest in an ivory tower. If everyone who namedropped Dragon Quest Monsters during the Palworld/Pokémon discourse had actually bought a copy of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Black Prince, Square Enix might have brought over more Dragon Quest Monsters games. And hey, all those arguments about Expedition 33 and Square Enix's turn-based games are incomplete without recognizing all of the work Square Enix has put into titles like Dragon Quest XI (like how the Switch adds a sprite-based mode for playing the game, a la the 3DS remakes). Dragon Quest isn't the end-all, be-all of Japanese RPGs, and there were plenty of other games that were made leading up to their original title on Famicom... but getting anyone to recognize Dragon Quest in America is an uphill battle. At any rate: Dragon Quest VII is getting a remake. And while it's not an HD-2D remake along the lines of the Erdrick Trilogy, it's nevertheless a top-to-bottom remake of the whole game. Er—another one, since we also had a comprehensive 3D remake of Dragon Quest VII back on the 3DS. Dragon Quest VII is a weird entry for the series; while tremendously overshadowed in the United States due to releasing alongside the graphical powerhouse that was Final Fantasy X, DQ7 also had a very long intro; famously, the PS1 original front-ended the game with a lot of puzzles, so much so that it could take you as long as five hours to encounter your first Slime in battle. Of course, there's a story reason: the protagonist accidentally petrifies his village, and he has to recover several stone tablets to break the curse. This whole quest has a very tragic ending, as many vignettes in Dragon Quest do, but it leads to a game that can have triple-digit length. Dragon Quest VII's deal is its class system: much like Final Fantasy V, characters can be given specific jobs for battle, with each victory leading towards improving their proficiency in that class. There are a lot of classes, many of which are unlocked as combinations of other classes. And that's before we get to the Monster classes, earned by fighting monsters. Yes, there's a Metal Slime class, and yes, it's a pain to unlock and master. Look forward to this one on February 5. Here's one that gets me: Nintendo is adding the Virtual Boy's library to the Nintendo Switch Online repertoire, along with other consoles like the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64. People have had words about this. For starters, the Virtual Boy was a failure of a console: its early attempts at 3D (plus everything being in shades of red) caused headaches, and the console wasn't very comfortable. All told, only 22 games were made for the console—14 of them are available on the NSO+Expansion service. This includes several... well, I can't call them "classics," but they're still noteworthy. Wario Land was the first game in the series, and had its first entry made on the Virtual Boy, making this the first time it's been ported, ever. There's also Jack Bros., a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off starring Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Jack Ripper. The point of contention is that the Virtual Boy games aren't available to play in 2D—they're exclusively designed for 3D play. So to play the Virtual Boy games, you'll need an accessory that effectively re-creates the original console that you'll slot your Switch or Switch 2 into. The accessory costs $100 USD, which I agree, is a lot. I understand why Nintendo made it; it's to keep the games in context and because they likely don't have a way to allow these games to be played in 2D without extensively reworking them—a tall order for 30-year-old games from a failed console. Nobody's playing a Virtual Boy game to play it in 2D anyhow, the way I see it. The bit where I scrunch my nose up is people doomsaying about the $100 add-on... when there's a $25 alternative that's also for sale. If you don't want to spend $100, you don't have to. Heck, I even appreciate that Nintendo found a new use for the Nintendo Labo components. But the discussion begins and ends with the $100 doohickey. I've seen other peers point out how Nintendo also offers Switch-compatible variants of older controllers, from the NES and N64 controllers to even the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controller for use with the NSO titles; a quick look at Nintendo's store reveals that those are all in the ballpark of $65. My dudes, the cardboard option is cheaper than a N64 controller. There's so much to complain about. I don't understand why this is the straw that breaks the camel's back, nor do I understand why people can't see the cheap option that's literally right there. Speaking of old stuff, Koei Tecmo is bringing back another Fatal Frame title with a remake of Crimson Butterfly. Originally released in 2003(!), Crimson Butterfly tells the story of a young woman named Mio searching for her twin sister, Mayu, in an abandoned town. Along the way, Mio investigates an old ritual that the village was undergoing. Jumpscares and creepy Japanese ghosts ensue. The series' traditional Camera Obscura is still the central mechanic, a camera that can banish ghosts. This one's another comprehensive top-to-bottom remake; if it's half as good as the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse remake from 2023 (which I reviewed), it'll be a treat! Others and I would definitely prefer a new Fatal Frame proper, but this is a good-enough stopgap. Look forward to it in early 2026. I am disappointed that nobody is talking about the new Suika Game. Suika Game was a huge hit among streamers and players alike, and countless Suika Game clones have emerged in its wake, like IntiCreates' PuzzMix. Just this past summer, Shift-Up even had a Suika Game-esque mini-game for their Boom The Ghost event in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE! In upping the ante, Aladdin X has taken the game to the only place left to go: space. Suika Game Planet has you dropping fruit into an orb at the center of the screen. You can arrange the fruit all around the planet, but they can't break its surface (it's more of a bubble, so the edges have some give). Another twist is in the form of Super Evolution, which grants you bonuses depending on how many fruits of which type you've combined in a row. It's even compatible with Game Share on the Switch 2! I don't expect Suika Game to register on most people's radar, but it'll definitely be a fun hit once it lands this Winter. A major twist was delivered regarding Metroid Prime 4: Samus has a sick sci-fi bike! The reveal comes along with the twist that Metroid Prime 4 is now seemingly an open-world game, with Samus riding her new bike across massive vistas in search of new locales to explore. There's some consternation over this, given that Metroid has been at its best when it's nurturing a claustrophobic vibe. I'm with them. The trailer shows a sequence of Samus facing off against a pack of wolf-like creatures during a blizzard; it seems so pedestrian for Samus to be fighting space-wolves, given all of the other bizarre alien life-forms she's encountered. Regardless: Metroid Prime 4 is slated for a December 4 release, with Amiibo and an art book set to release shortly beforehand. Donkey Kong Bananza has some DLC out now. Most of us expected DLC related to the twist reveal in Bananza, but the DLC is only tangentially related: you actually get to explore D.K. Island! It even plays the song from Donkey Kong 64! There's also the new Emerald Rush mode, a rogue-lite mode where Donkey Kong has to smash enough emerald ore within a time frame. You'll find fossils and stuff that can unlock perks as you run around smashing things, and better performance unlocks new stages in lower layers. A unique twist is that the locations for all of the ores and fossils are a constant, so you'll be able to strategize and plan out your route. The news of Pokémon: Pokopia has some people unsettled, if only because your player character is a Ditto who has shapeshifted (badly) into a human. This has deep ramifications for the world of Pokémon that nobody wants to contend with. The idea itself is fun; however, Ditto will meet other Pokémon and learn moves from them that allow it to modify the environment. As the environment is made more comfortable, more Pokémon arrive, teaching Ditto more moves that allow it to create a whole village for the Pokémon to live in. The idea has been likened to Dragon Quest Builders, which I feel is apt (provided I haven't played Dragon Quest Builders yet). It's a cute idea, and I can see it leading into explaining how Pokémon in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games have places to live. Let's go into a lightning round for some other titles: Danganronpa 2 is getting an expanded port with Danganronpa 2x2, which not only includes the base Danganronpa 2 but also a new scenario with a new story. It'll be available next year, also on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Dynasty Warriors Origins lands on Switch 2 this January 22, with paid DLC announced. Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections has a March 16 release date. Resident Evil 9 arrives for the Switch 2 on February 27, wildly enough, with Resident Evil VII and Resident Evil: Village in tow. A new Fire Emblem is coming! Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave takes the series to a Greco-Roman setting, where some would-be heroes duke it out in front of their regent in the hopes of having a wish granted. Some fight for revenge, others fight for someone else. Sothis from Fire Emblem: Three Houses is back, so maybe this takes place in the same world? Who knows. I have an issue with Fortune's Weave, though. Several of the lead characters have darker skin; the protagonist we see is ostensibly a Black young man. His design is otherwise okay. I love his hair (he doesn't have the Killmonger haircut!). But a problem he and the other darker-skinned characters have is that they all have an ashy skin color. It does them a disservice. Mika Pikazo took a lot of heat for the toothpaste hair in Fire Emblem Engage, but she did right by the dark-skinned cast like Timerra by giving them beautiful skin tones. Even in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Claude's olive skintone belied his Mediterranean-inspired origins. So it's a disappointment that the ball was dropped with Fortune's Weave. Still, the cast seems interesting, the designs are nice, and I especially like the hairstyles. So I'm hopeful. Here's where everyone lost their marbles. Paid DLC has been announced for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which releases this October 16. Now, this DLC includes new story content, as well as two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu (Raichu X and Raichu Y). The announcement of paid DLC before the game has launched has people outraged... as though this is the first time any game has been announced with paid DLC at launch. The trailer also reveals new Mega Evolutions for the Kalosian starters, Delphox, Chesknight, and Greninja. Notably, these three Pokémon didn't have Mega Evolutions in their original game, which, in the eyes of many, was an oversight. Legends Z-A corrects this... but also, the Mega Stones for these Mega Evolutions are barred behind timed ranked play over the course of three in-game seasons. There has been a lot of discourse about this being beyond the pale and a sign of Nintendo's modern-day "greed." Let's break this down for a minute. First off: the DLC. Where have people been for the past decade? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate had announced paid DLC before it launched, too! And the only carrot on that stick was knowing that the first character in the DLC list was the Piranha Plant! Nintendo has done this with all three Xenoblade Chronicles games on the Switch, going back to Xenoblade 2! Getting the Season passes was how you unlocked a stash of items and the post-game stories (which are effectively games unto themselves). This isn't new! This hasn't been new for years! You can't even say it's exclusive to Nintendo—Sonic Racing Crossworlds also has been promoting paid DLC for the game, and that game hasn't launched either! There's a lot to argue over paid DLC as a means of bilking people out of their money, but that discussion has long since passed us by. One of the funniest clips from my favorite Vtuber is her going through almost a minute's worth of prompts from all the cosmetic DLC she bought before playing the game. For better or worse, paid DLC is just a standard factor in games these days. And you're telling me it's a problem now? In a Pokémon game? I've seen people claim that this artificially inflates the price of Pokémon Legends: Z-A--again, where have people been? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate costs $120 with both season passes—and you're going to want those, if you want to use Kazuya Mishima or Steve! It disturbs me how much people make this their hill to die on after actual years of literally every other publisher and developer going through with it. Especially since this is now such an entrenched belief with people. It's a truism that Nintendo is especially greedy, patent-starved and disrespectful to its fans and you're the crazy one if you bring up receipts proving otherwise. These are stances I can understand coming from rage-bait content creators online, who have the ears of the entire fandom. I am puzzled that people who should know better fall into these talking points. It's not even that paid DLC isn't a bad thing—it's sure as hell not, especially not since so many games had actual content cut from the main game just to be turned into DLC. That people decided Pokémon was where things were a bridge too far is what blows my mind. I half-expect that if Nintendo ever introduces a gacha system in a Pokémon game, it will finally prompt the rest of the industry to abandon the practice. There's also consternation about Pokémon imported from Pokémon Home getting stuck in Legends Z-A if and when they're imported. Again, not fun! I don't like this! But I understand why it's happening: Legends Z-A has a unique battle system and Pokémon data likely has to be reformatted to accommodate it, and it'll likely be too much of a pain to reformat Legends Z-A data back out of Legends Z-A. This means that the unique Mega Evolutions in Legends Z-A are landlocked into the game... for now. Seriously, there's no way Mega Victreebell or Mega Hawlucha aren't going to be made available some other way. Pokémon Champions is still releasing soon, after all. Again, this is disappointing... but people know that you can't import Pokémon from the first two Generations into Gen 3 onward, right? Even now, there's no legal alternative to get Pokémon from Pokémon Gold out of those games. Sure, there were digital alternatives on the 3DS—but if you wanted to rescue your old Lugia from your old cartridge, there's no official means. I'll go a step further, because as much as I dislike this, I still don't think it's the worst. Monster Rancher 4 had an exclusive in-game monster based on Kasumi from Dead or Alive. The only way to get her was by scanning a copy of Dead or Alive: Hardcore for the PlayStation 2. So you had to spend $100 to buy two games, to get a special-edition Monster. And that's just Kasumi—I'm not counting White Hound, a unique variant of the default Tiger monsters. You could only get White Hound in Monster Rancher 4 by scanning a DVD copy of Princess Mononoke (or Red Hot Chili Peppers' By The Way album). That's another, what? $30 USD? And I haven't even gotten to all of the other exclusive monsters. And then there's Yokai Watch 2's Local Yokai, which you could only get by playing participating Yokai Watch arcade games in certain regions of Japan. That's right: you had to physically travel across the country to get all the cards with the QR codes for these promotional monsters. Or buy the cards second-hand, which still takes money. It's bizarre how much anger gets levied towards Pokémon because I can point to so many similar issues from other monster-taming RPGs. And I think this really highlights the hollowness of much of the discourse surrounding the titles. It doesn't even invalidate the criticisms, but it definitely puts Pokémon into context. But that's the context that usually gets lost since most people don't look into the genre past Pokémon. That'll do it for this week. It's been a bit since I had a column this long... I stepped back and took a screenshot of the whole column when I had finished writing up the Nintendo Direct breakdown, and it was already long enough to be a column unto itself. That's what they pay me for, babes...! I might actually be glibbed out this time. Be good to each other. I'll see you in seven. This Week in Games homepage / archives

Title: Are Magnificent 7 stocks overpriced? Here are alternatives.

If you know anything about stocks, you’ve probably heard of the Magnificent Seven. Seven tech giants – Amazon, Apple, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – have driven massive gains on Wall Street over the past decade, collectively earning an eye-popping 698% between 2015 and 2024, according to The Motley Fool. The S&P 500 as a whole returned a comparatively modest 178% in those years. If you own shares of any broad index fund that tracks large American companies, you probably own shares of the Magnificent Seven. In 2015, the Magnificent Seven made up 12% of the total market value of the S&P 500. In 2025, the seven companies account for 34% of that value. Anyone who has owned Magnificent Seven stock over those years has reason to rejoice. They are the toast of Wall Street. “The Magnificent Seven are heroes,” said Jim Cramer, a CNBC stock-market pundit, in a Sept. 15 broadcast. “And I’m not going to tell you to sell heroes, unless something changes that makes them feel a lot less heroic.” Why would anyone consider selling a stake in the Magnificent Seven? Here are some reasons. First of all, market forecasts suggest the Magnificent Seven are overpriced. Economists measure the value of a stock by a formula called cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, or CAPE ratio. It measures a stock’s price against corporate earnings. It tells you, in effect, whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued. Right now, the CAPE ratio for the S&P 500 stands at 39.7. That means stock prices are very expensive, relative to earnings. Forecasters point to two prior moments when the CAPE Ratio ran high. One was in 1929. The other was in 1999. In the decades that followed those peaks, the stock market plummeted. Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have higher price-to-earnings ratios than the S&P 500 as a whole, according to another Motley Fool analysis. That means Magnificent Seven stocks are historically overvalued. Based on that premise, Vanguard projects that U.S. growth stocks, a category the Magnificent Seven dominate, will rise by only 1.9% to 3.9% annually over the next decade. Despite the red flags, investors are still scooping up Magnificent Seven stocks. Nvidia stock is up 28% on the year, as of Sept. 18. Meta is up 31%. Alphabet is up 32%. “I own them. I love them. I’m going to keep holding them for the next 10 years. That’s what I do,” said David Gardner, co-founder of Motley Fool. Motley Fool includes two of the Seven, Alphabet and Amazon, on its current list of 10 Top Stocks to Buy and Hold. The Magnificent Seven have plenty of upsides. They are some of the most successful companies in history, lauded for technological innovation, global reach and brand recognition, strong revenue and earnings, and diverse operations that can adapt to changing market conditions. “Here you’re talking about concentration in seven of the most profitable, most diversified companies in the world,” said Jonathan Swanburg, a certified financial planner in Houston. Whatever your opinion about the Magnificent Seven, if you are an index-fund investor, you may own more of the stocks than you realize. “The first step would be to understand just how much exposure you have to them,” said Andrew Patterson, head of active research at Vanguard. The runaway success of the Seven has reshaped the stock market, with the Magnificent Seven at its core. If you have $1,000 invested in a typical S&P index fund, roughly $340 of that money is tied up in the Magnificent Seven. Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple, alone, make up more than 20% of the value of the typical S&P index fund, and nearly 20% of the typical “total stock market” index fund. As a rule, market concentration is considered a bad thing. Investors are urged to diversify: not to hold only stocks, and not to hold too much of any one stock. Because of the massive gains by Magnificent Seven stocks, many everyday investors now own more of those stocks – and more stocks in general – than they intended. An investor who started out with a 60-40 mix of stocks and bonds may now own a 70-30 mix: The stocks have outperformed the bonds. Whether you own too much Magnificent Seven stock, or too much stock in general, depends on your tolerance for risk and how far you are from retirement, among other factors, Patterson said. A potential solution is rebalancing: Invest in other asset classes. Maybe even sell some of your Magnificent Seven stock. To avoid market concentration and overpriced stocks, forecasters say, here are some other investments to consider:

Title: Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay deal is ambitious — but so was his last 'mammoth' one, tech guru says
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-elon-musk-schiffer-compensation-pay-ai-tech-bubble-2025-9
Time Published: 2025-09-19T09:00:02Z
Full Content:
Tesla's $1 trillion pay deal for Elon Musk has triggered the same skepticism that greeted his ambitious 2018 pay deal, tech investor Eric Schiffer has said. In a wide-ranging interview with Business Insider, the CEO of private-equity firm the Patriarch Organization said Musk's previous deal also tied a "mammoth" payout to extremely challenging goals. That agreement required Musk to grow Tesla's market value from around $60 billion to $650 billion, its 12-month revenue from below $20 billion to $175 billion, and its adjusted profits from under $1.5 billion to $14 billion to get the full compensation. Schiffer recalled the deal was labeled "insane" and "crazy," with commentators declaring there was "no way in hell he'll ever achieve that." "And you know what, he did," Schiffer added. Under the company's latest plan, Musk would have 10 years to raise Tesla's market value from around $1.3 trillion to $8.5 trillion, boost its adjusted profits to $400 billion, deliver 20 million Tesla vehicles and a million Bots, reach 10 million active full self-driving (FSD) subscriptions, and bring a million robotaxis into commercial operation. "If he were to accomplish that, investors would do backflips, and of course, he should be compensated," Schiffer said. Awarding $1 trillion worth of stock to a CEO who's built an $8.5 trillion company would be reasonable, he added. Schiffer told Business Insider that the AI frenzy may have shades of the dot-com bubble at the turn of this century, but he's not worried about a crash. Many dot-com players were loss-making and had valuations "astronomically out of whack," Schiffer said. By contrast, Meta, Alphabet, and the other tech titans leading the AI charge are "money gushers" showing no signs of slowing down. Schiffer gave the example of Oracle, which recently disclosed that its expected contract revenue more than quadrupled year on year to $455 billion last quarter, thanks to strong AI demand. The software giant's stock price surged as much as 43% in a single day, boosting its market value by nearly $300 billion at its peak, as investors banked on years of rapid revenue growth. AI companies are "priced close to perfection," but their valuations also reflect a "continued escalation of earning estimates that I don't think are going to slow down, frankly," Schiffer said. "I think there's more to come." Schiffer, who has 18-year-old twins, said young people face a "more difficult" backdrop than previous generations between political divisions, wars, an affordability crisis, and AI-fueled job losses. He advised them to figure out their strengths and apply them to activities that are "profoundly human," where people maintain an advantage over AI. He gave the examples of healthcare and enterprise sales, where trust and relationships are vital. Schiffer also recommended they "get fluent with AI — learn how to master it, write it, work it." He added that "people are not going away," and knowing how to work with AI will benefit many industries for years. Shiffer also offered some advice for wealthy parents on not raising entitled children. "Do not give your money to your kids," he said. "That is not the move — it will not serve them or help them create agency, develop their own future, build their own security, or make things happen on their own." For those children who receive large sums from their parents, Schiffer urged long-term responsibility over frivolous spending. "That's a great gift, something you want to steward and manage and help to grow," he said. Jump to

Title: Apple’s iPhone 17, Air go on sale to years of demand for new look

Friday, 19 Sep 2025 A customer looks at Apple's iPhone 17 series at the company's Sanlitun store during the first day of sales of the smartphones in Beijing, China, on Sept 19, 2025. — Bloomberg For the past four years, some Apple Inc customers have been waiting for a fresh design before buying a new iPhone. The time has come for those consumers, with the iPhone 17 Pro, Pro Max and iPhone Air going on sale Sept 19. In a first since 2020, Apple is rolling out several new iPhone designs. It’s also releasing into stores a new Apple Watch SE, Watch Series 11, Watch Ultra 3 and AirPods Pro 3. Early sales across Asia showed strong demand for the Pro models. In Hong Kong, a small crowd assembled at Apple’s flagship store to check out the new handsets, but stock for walk-in purchases was limited only to the novel iPhone Air. Anyone wanting to purchase an iPhone 17 or Pro edition was directed to order online, where Apple indicated wait times of roughly three weeks. Australia, New Zealand, mainland China and Singapore’s Apple stores showed similar shipping times, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max wait extending to as long as four weeks. Japan was the only major market where consumers could acquire any new iPhone model with next-day delivery, while in South Korea the 17 Pro was available within a week whereas the Pro Max was marked as unavailable until late October. The new Pro editions return the iPhone to an aluminum shell and have a redesigned back, while the iPhone Air is Apple’s first attempt at a radically different design with its thin shape as the main selling point. The stakes are high for Apple. The company faces high expectations from Wall Street for sales over the holiday period, despite global economic concerns and the threat of future price increases due to tariffs. The Cupertino, California-based electronics giant is also trying to convince consumers its mojo is back after its artificial intelligence strategy fell flat. The new models’ reception in China will be of great importance to the company. Sales in the region fell 6% in the weeks leading up to the new device family launch, marking a steeper-than-usual slump. After years of success in the region over the past decade, Apple now only holds 12% of the local market, trailing Oppo, Huawei Technologies Co, Xiaomi Corp and others. The launch of its latest major iteration of the iPhone – a product that debuted in 2007 – hits as Meta Platforms Inc and others are moving on to AI-powered wearables, including smart glasses with displays. The new models also land weeks after Alphabet Inc’s Google and Samsung Electronics Co rolled out upgrades to their flagship smartphones. Samsung, in particular, is a threat to the iPhone’s dominance. It launched a seventh-generation version of its book-style foldable phone, which appears to be a hit with consumers due to its more durable frame and thinner look. Apple won’t have a foldable phone until the end of next year, Bloomberg News has reported. The iPhone 17 Pro line is resonating most with buyers because it improves the features that people most want in a new phone: battery life, camera technology and durability. It’s also priced from US$1,099 (from RM5,499 in Malaysia), only US$100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro it replaces. "Prices are being really increased for the first time in several years, so if we see a typical replacement cycle with higher prices, plus some progress on AI, that may not be an exciting setup for the stock, but it’s a decent one,” said John Belton, portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which has US$33bil (RM138.92bil) in assets under management. The iPhone Air, on the other hand, may not drive sales despite the attention it will receive. The US$999 device focuses on a thin profile, but has drawbacks in battery life, audio and cameras. It’s also the same price as a 17 Pro when factoring in an optional magnetic battery attachment to increase endurance. Earlier this year, Samsung launched the Galaxy S25 Edge, using a similar concept to Apple’s iPhone Air. Thus far, it’s been a sales dud. – Bloomberg Thank you for your report!

Title: Forbes Daily: Federal Reserve Signals ‘Lift-Off’ For Rate Cuts

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. It finally happened. After months of pressure from President Donald Trump, the Federal Reserve eased interest rates Wednesday. The central bank slashed the federal funds rate by a quarter-point to between 4% and 4.25%, and said it expects two more cuts by the end of the year amid concerns about a weakening labor market. In a note, Fitch Ratings’ head of U.S. economic research called the decision “lift-off” for a “decisively aggressive cutting cycle.” For consumers, lower interest rates mean cheaper borrowing costs and a potential drop in mortgage rates. Crypto could even get a boost, as some Americans could opt for riskier assets to earn a greater yield. ABC pulled Jimmy Kimmel Live! from the air Wednesday due to the host’s comments about conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Shortly before the Disney-owned broadcaster made the announcement, media company Nexstar, which owns a number of local ABC affiliates, said it would preempt the late-night talk show. The decision comes as Nexstar seeks FCC approval for its $6.2 billion acquisition of TEGNA, which would give it the largest share of local TV stations in the U.S. After three failed efforts to take StubHub public, cofounder Eric Baker finally got his wish Wednesday as the online ticket marketplace began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on its $23.50 per share listing price, the company is valued at $8.6 billion, giving Baker an estimated net worth of $800 million. Shares of Lyft reached a three-year high as the rideshare firm announced a partnership with Waymo that will bring the autonomous ride-hailing service to Nashville. Waymo is looking to grow the market for its robotaxi rides, and has received $12 billion in investments from parent company Alphabet and others. Meta’s share price rose in premarket trading this morning after it showed off a new pair of AI-powered smart glasses at the company's Meta Connect keynote Wednesday night. The new Meta Ray-Ban Display will be able to read messages, receive video calls and follow map directions on its right lens. The glasses will be available September 30 and cost $799. A new climate economy is advancing in spite of threats to stall its progress, fueled by record clean energy investment, China’s green-tech boom, and a worldwide surge in renewable power. The second Forbes Sustainability Leaders list honors 50 individuals setting the pace for a just, sustainable economy and defining what climate leadership looks like today. MORE: Among the list’s honorees is billionaire Wendy Schmidt: She and her husband, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, have directed a significant portion of their $2 billion in lifetime giving toward environmental initiatives. The stakes for private science funding have never been higher, with Donald Trump back in the White House and a second wave of federal rollbacks targeting climate funding and scientific independence. A small Israeli startup is stress testing AI models for giants like OpenAI and Anthropic to evaluate their capacity for malicious hacking, as the industry grapples with AI misuse. On Wednesday, the startup, which is changing its name to Irregular, announced $80 million in new funding, valuing it at $450 million. As ICE builds up its arsenal of equipment like tactical gear, guns and surveillance kits, contract records show the agency spent $78,000 on a robot capable of opening doors, climbing stairs and firing off smoke bombs during house raids. The contracts, along with purchases of drones and AI-powered facial recognition technology, have raised concerns about ICE’s spending on surveillance and arms that could be used to target the immigrant population. The CDC’s immunization advisory committee—whose membership Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. purged in June and replaced with people more aligned with his anti-vaccine views—is slated to meet starting today. On the agenda, a topic crucial to the health of the country and its pharma industry: childhood vaccinations, as well as Covid-19 shots. Since his appointment, Kennedy has been pushing anti-vaccine policies at the federal level and this meeting could prove critical for U.S. immunization policy going forward. Already, he has announced plans to award a no-bid contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to “investigate” long-debunked links between vaccines and autism, and appointed committee members like Retsef Levi and Robert Malone, who have been outspoken opponents of Covid vaccines, which saved an estimated 14.4 million lives the first year after they were made available, and Catherine Stein, who has argued against vaccine mandates. All of this puts pharmaceutical companies into uncharted territory. Vaccines are a big business: Grand View Research estimates the global vaccine market reached $88 billion last year, with the U.S. accounting for the major share of it. They’re also a safe business: Many vaccines have been around for decades, and regulations around them have been both relatively certain and grounded in evidence. That may no longer be the case. On Friday, shares of the biggest Covid-19 vaccine makers fell dramatically when Trump Administration health officials indicated they were investigating unsubstantiated reports of child deaths from the vaccine. WHY IT MATTERS The United States’ childhood immunization program is widely recognized as one of the greatest achievements of public health. It eradicated measles in the U.S. by the year 2000, slashed the infection rate of hepatitis B by 99%, and turned whooping cough into a rarity. Any weakening of recommendations for childhood immunizations could lead to fewer shots, and even a 10% drop in childhood vaccinations could lead to millions of hospitalizations and tens of thousands of deaths among the nation’s children, according to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association. MORE Trump Administration’s Attack On MRNA Vaccines Threatens American Biotech Dominance French luxury conglomerate Kering, parent of brands such as Gucci and Alexander McQueen, confirmed that customer data was stolen in an April cyberattack, potentially impacting millions. It’s the latest luxury company to fall victim to cybercriminals: 7.4 million: The number of unique email addresses hacker group Shiny Hunters, which claimed credit for the breach, told the BBC that it had Over $10,000, up to $86,000: The amount spent by Kering customers in sample records the BBC reviewed, which contained their names and phone numbers 16%: The sales decline Kering reported in the first half of 2025 Everyone faces hardship in life, but it’s important to find ways to stay true to who you are even amid the most difficult of times. Embrace the cycle of struggle and rebirth, and focus your identity on your strengths—rather than just what you do for work. Lastly, create a sense of urgency around your goals to ensure you don’t procrastinate.

Title: Small-Cap Russell 2000 Shakes Off Four-Year Funk on Rate Cut

The hope for the S&P 500’s small-cap cousin after the Fed’s rate cut tells an important story about the broader economy. Sean Craig sean.craig@thedailyupside.com Federal Reserve officials lowered the target range for their benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4% to 4.25% — with Chair Jerome Powell flagging weakening jobs data — and penciled in two more cuts by the end of 2025. Yawn. The only thing less surprising than that yesterday was the calendar showing the day was Wednesday. But as Powell emphasized the Fed’s jobs, jobs, jobs focus, a winner emerged on the trading floor: the small-cap Russell 2000, a laggard during this year’s market rally that is now on pace to finally break the nearly four-year drought since its last record closing high. The S&P 500, naturally, has been on a tear, setting five records this month alone. Some market watchers including Deutsche Bank, factoring in rate cuts as drivers of stock prices, think it can hit 7,000 by the end of the year. The hope for its small-cap cousin, meanwhile, is less ambitious but tells an important story about the broader economy. The Russell 2000, which tracks the performance of 2,000 smaller companies in the broader Russell 3000 Index, was underwater through the end of June, while the S&P 500 had recovered from the post-Liberation Day tariffs shock by mid-May. But since the end of July, the Russell 2000 has jumped 10%, double the S&P’s rise in the same time. Following the rate cut announcement on Wednesday, the small-cap index rose more than 2% and at one point advanced past its all-time closing high of 2,442.74. It ultimately pared gains and finished up 0.2%, but a new record high, topping the one set in November 2021, seems finally within reach. That’s because of the unique meaning of a rate cut for small-caps: Not Out of the Woods: Reduced interest costs, of course, aren’t the only high-level economic factor on the minds of executives and investors. One risk for small-cap firms is that their lower margins, higher debt loads and attenuated supply chains are all highly sensitive to tariffs, which Powell said Wednesday could lead to a “one-time shift” in prices or cause “more persistent” inflation. For the time being, Bank of America and UBS are among the Wall Street heavyweights that foresee a Russell 2000 rebound. But even those who expect the market rally to broaden and include small caps, like Goldman Sachs, have cautioned, “there is limited scope for small-caps and other ‘lower quality’ stocks to consistently outperform,” which is a hint that you should diversify your portfolio. And yet, last week, Tesla scored a couple key brownie points from Wall Street analysts. So why the optimism? Meta will likely soon face competition from Amazon, Alphabet, Snap and other tech firms with augmented-reality glasses in development. President Trump wants to end mandated quarterly financial reports for publicly traded companies. Odds are his dream comes true. In a note last week, JPMorgan’s Andrew Tyler wrote that macro conditions could turn a widely-expected rate cut into a “sell the news” event. Demand for copper, already one of the most commonly used metals in the world, has surged amid the AI computing boom. The return-to-office orders have taken on new weight amid a softening labor market and broader economic anxiety. More than 94 million pet-owning US households are expected to spend $157 billion on their little Lunas and Rexes this year. Morgan Stanley analysts think the US economy has been in a “rolling recession” since 2022 — and it may already be almost over. iPhone sales surged to $44.5 billion in the quarter ending in June, besting analysts’ $40 billion expectations and rising 14% year-over-year. Investor appetite for StubHub and Klarna is especially compelling at a time when consumer sentiment starting to slump. The latest jobs report appeared to confirm that America’s labour market is slowing, which may clinch the rate cut markets are salivating over. Small, mountainous Switzerland — a country that ranks 61st in the world by total area — is one of the world’s biggest investors in the US. © 2025 The Daily Upside

Title: How Micron Stock Surges 2x To $300
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/18/how-micron-stock-surges-2x-to-300/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T09:00:27Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Micron Technology stock (NASDAQ:MU) has increased approximately 80% from about $87 at the beginning of 2025 to nearly $157, reaching all-time highs in the process. So, what is driving this increase for Micron? It all revolves around the demand for AI infrastructure, which is boosting sales of high-bandwidth memory products, also referred to as HBM. Even after this substantial rally, Micron stock is valued at about 20× estimated earnings for 2025. Projected growth looks robust: expected revenues are set to rise by 48% this fiscal year, based on consensus estimates, while growth is anticipated at roughly 31% for FY’26. Given this strong growth paired with a reasonable valuation, could Micron stock potentially double to around $300? Below, we outline this scenario. Demand is being propelled by the swift adoption of generative AI, which necessitates high-performance memory to function at scale. While DRAM offers capacity, HBM supplies the bandwidth and low latency required for large language models. Micron serves as a primary supplier for Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell GB200 platform, alongside AMD’s Instinct MI350 series GPUs. The memory requirements for each AI system are also escalating: for example, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell systems feature 33% more memory per node compared to earlier-generation chips. Additionally, as AI models transition from being text-only to incorporating multimodal formats such as video and speech, memory intensity is on the rise. With AI expected to be broadly adopted throughout the economy, Micron is positioned for a prolonged growth trajectory. To illustrate the scale of the investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) have indicated that they could collectively invest $364 billion in capital expenditures for their respective current fiscal years. However, supply may not keep pace easily. Manufacturing HBM is more intricate than standard DRAM, and supply levels are still constrained. The production of HBM is wafer-intensive — it requires approximately three times as many wafers as standard DRAM to create the same quantity of bits due to its lower bit density and intricate 3D stacking. This forms a natural bottleneck. Although Micron has been expanding its HBM production capacity, output for 2025 is already sold out, with robust demand anticipated in 2026. Micron aims to significantly increase its HBM market share, targeting about 20 to 25% of the HBM segment by the end of 2025. Beyond HBM, Micron remains the sole volume producer of low-power DRAM for data centers, providing an advantage as AI workloads increasingly emphasize efficiency. Looking forward, even after this increase, Micron does not appear to be overvalued. Its revenues surged by 58%, from $21 billion in 2023 to $34 billion in 2024, as the company rebounded from a downturn. Consensus forecasts indicate revenues climbing from roughly $25.1 billion in FY’24 to $37.1 billion in FY’25, and by about 31% to $48.7 billion in FY’26. HBM has been a significant factor in this growth, with HBM revenue achieving a $6 billion annualized run rate and a projected $10 billion run rate by 2026. Increased HBM production does place pressure on conventional DRAM supply, contributing to rising DRAM prices, which may also enhance revenues for products outside of HBM. If we project a slightly more conservative annual growth rate of 25% between FY’26 and FY’28, Micron could generate approximately $77 billion in revenues by FY’28. Micron's net margins were around 20% over the first nine months of this year. It is possible that this figure could grow further due to a higher proportion of higher-margin HBM chips and improved economies of scale. Assuming net margins rise to about 22% in FY’28, this would equate to net income of approximately $17 billion. With a forward P/E ratio of about 20x, this would imply a market cap of around $340 billion, suggesting the stock price could nearly double from current levels. That said, competition persists. SK Hynix continues to dominate the HBM market with an approximate 50% share and an advantage in production, particularly regarding HBM4. Micron is increasing HBM3E production and testing HBM4, but it is still striving to catch up. HBM4 is anticipated to power Nvidia’s upcoming Rubin architecture for AI accelerators. The memory market has also historically been subject to significant cyclical behavior, and Micron is no exception. DRAM and NAND remain vulnerable to fluctuations in supply and demand along with pricing volatility. At this time, it appears that HBM serves as a partially secular growth driver, with AI infrastructure investments, high profit margins, and strong order visibility providing some degree of protection. Nevertheless, HBM presently comprises less than 20% of total revenues, meaning the company is not entirely insulated from traditional market cycles. Furthermore, AI demand may normalize following years of heavy investment if shareholders start demanding superior returns and more efficient capital management. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, has a history of consistently outperforming its benchmark, which includes all three – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What accounts for this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks delivered superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother ride, as demonstrated in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Meta’s new Ray-Ban smart glasses have an integrated display and gesture-based controls
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/09/17/metas-new-ray-ban-smart-glasses-integrated-display-gesture-based-controls/
Time Published: 2025-09-18T02:55:24Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 22:55 EDT / SEPTEMBER 17 2025 by Mike Wheatley Meta Platforms Inc. is racing ahead of its competitors in the virtual reality and augmented reality worlds with the launch of a new and more sophisticated pair of Ray-Ban branded smart glasses. It debuted alongside a new technology called Hyperscape, which enables Meta’s VR headset Quest to replicate real-world spaces in a virtual environment. Meta founder and Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage late today at the company’s annual Meta Connect event, where he showcased the company’s next-generation smart glasses. They’re called the Meta Ray-Ban Display, and unlike the original Ray-Ban Meta specs, they come with a built-in display on the right lens. It’s visible only to the wearer, and meant to show various applications, notifications and directions. The smart glasses can be controlled by a special wristband called the Meta Neural Band, which picks up on the user’s gestures. There’s an integrated AI assistant that allows for voice controls so users can navigate through social media applications and browse the internet, and the specs also feature a built-in camera, speakers and microphone. Meta Ray-Ban Display is a notable upgrade that makes it possible for smart glasses to do pretty much any task that can be done on a smartphone, and if it can popularize the concept it could be a game-changer for the company. For years, Meta has been forced to reach its users through third-party devices such as Apple Inc.’s iPhones, Google LLC’s Android phones and Microsoft Corp.’s Windows computers, but with the Ray-Ban Display, it now owns the hardware as well as the software. Onstage, Zuckerberg spoke about all of the different things users will be able to do with Meta Ray-Ban Display that couldn’t be done with the company’s original smart glasses. The most important thing is the display, which allows users to view posts in their Facebook feed and messages on apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as live translations. The Neural Band that ships with the device is similar to something like a Fitbit fitness device, and its purpose is to give users a way to navigate apps in Ray-Ban Display using small hand movements. It uses a technology known as electromyography, which picks up on the signals sent between the brain and the hand when performing gestures, Zuckerberg explained. He also mentioned that it’s water-resistant, just like the smart glasses, and has 18 hours of battery life. It should be noted that Meta Ray-Ban Display lacks some of the features seen on Meta’s prototype Orion smart glasses, which were shown off by Zuckerberg at Connect 2024. The Orion came with augmented reality lenses that could overlay graphics directly on the lens, and had an eye-tracking system to understand what people are looking at. Meta Ray-Ban Display, on the other hand, only has a small display integrated with what is otherwise just a standard lens. The good news is that consumers will be able to get their hands on Meta Ray-Ban Display soon. Zuckerberg said it’s going on sale in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., France, Italy, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Australia, Ireland, UAE, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, Switzerland and the Netherlands at the end of this month, with a price tag of $799. It’s also going to launch in Brazil and India “soon.” Those who don’t find the idea of an integrated display to their liking may want to check out the improved version of Meta’s displayless Ray-Ban Meta glasses. The company’s original smart glasses are getting a better battery that lasts up to eight hours, which is almost twice as long as before. There’s also a new “conversation focus” feature that amplifies the voice of whoever the wearer is speaking to, so they can hear them more clearly in noisy environments. It utilizes the specs’ integrated microphone to pick out the speaker’s voice, while artificial intelligence algorithms filter out the background noise, Zuckerberg said. In addition, Ray-Ban Meta is adding support for German and Portuguese language translation, but it will come at a higher cost, with the new version priced at $379, up from $299 for the older model. There’s a third pair of smart specs too. Meta said it has partnered with Oakley Inc. to create the Oakley Meta Vanguard (above) which is designed for “high-intensity sports.” It was first announced earlier this year, and features Oakley’s characteristic wraparound design and integrates fitness applications like Garmin and Strava, so wearers can ask Meta AI questions about their training performance. It has an IP67 rating that certifies its dust and water resistance and comes with a 12 megapixel, 122-degree camera that’s fitted on the nose bridge, enabling it to shoot videos at 3K resolution. It also supports new capture modes including slow-motion, time-lapse and hyperlapse, which will be available on the company’s other smart glasses too. Zuckerberg said Oakley Meta Vanguard has a battery life of about nine hours, and will cost $499 when it goes on sale next month. Moving away from specs to Quest, which is Meta’s flagship VR headset, there wasn’t any new hardware on show, but the older model is getting what looks to be a fascinating new capability in the shape of Hyperscape. Zuckerberg first spoke about Hyperscape at last year’s Connect, and it’s now being made available in early access. With Hyperscape, Quest users can scan whatever physical space they happen to be in and then ask the device to recreate that environment in VR. Though the capture process only takes a few minutes, during which users just walk around the room or space and make sure everything is videoed carefully, the actual creation process will take a “few hours,” Zuckerberg said. It uses technologies including Gaussian Splatting, cloud rendering and high-bandwidth streaming to recreate an immersive, photorealistic replica of any physical space, with the new Horizon Engine enabling better graphics and faster performance to generate more realistic virtual worlds than ever seen before. On stage at Connect, Zuckerberg demonstrated a few renderings of real-world locations, including Gordon Ramsey’s kitchen (above) at his home in Los Angeles, The Octagon at the UFC Apex in Las Vegas, Chance the Rapper’s House of Kicks, and a room that’s filled with the social media influencer Happy Kelli’s extensive Crocs shoe collection. While users will only be able to enjoy the spaces they create alone for the time being, Zuckerberg said the company is working on allowing users to invite others into their digital spaces via a private link, and hopes to add this capability in future. The Hyperscape is being rolled out gradually on Meta’s Quest 3 and Quest 3S headsets, and will be available to users aged 18 and older.
