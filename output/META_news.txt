Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes.

Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too.

We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Look back on the day's business news and developments as it happened with our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Emily Stewart Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Kate Ainsworth We'll be back again tomorrow for the latest unemployment figures coming from the ABS — but if you're hungry for more news, here's what's coming up on The Business tonight: Catch The Business on ABC News at 8:45pm, after the late news on ABC TV, and anytime on ABC iview.

By Kate Ainsworth The ASX 200 has ended lower on Wednesday, shedding 0.7% to close at 8,419 points. On the sectors front, energy and bank stocks dragged local shares lower — shedding 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. As for individual stocks, it was Mineral Resources which suffered the biggest hit. MinRes shares dipped by more than 21% in response to posting a loss of more than $800 million, and scrapping its interim dividend. Shares in NAB also fell during trade today, after the bank reported a 2% decline in cash earnings, and having its underlying profit increase offset by a higher credit impairment charge. The top performing stocks of the day were: And the bottom performing stocks: By Kate Ainsworth It's still company reporting season — and there's a few ASX heavyweights yet to drop their earnings results this month. Wondering who's left? Let this handy interactive calendar be your guide 👇 And if you need a refresher on how EBITDA differs EPS, look no further than this evergreen resource from the desk of Michael Janda: By Kate Ainsworth While there's more factors at play than just wages data for the RBA to consider before changing interest rates, Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says he expects we will see more cuts in the next 12 months. "If I were to make a prediction, I would say that a year from today the interest rate could be somewhere between 3% and 3.25%,"he said. "That is because the overall macroeconomic picture is favourable to a reduction in the interest rate. "There are however some risks, the main risk is related to international trade policy, we will have to see what happens with tariffs. "Tariffs can obviously have an impact on prices and therefore they could represent the potential source of future inflationary pressures. "But in spite of this risk, I still believe there could be a few more cuts in the next 12 months." By Kate Ainsworth Optus's parent company Singapore Telecommunications (also known as SingTel) shared its third quarter profit update earlier today — with the telco company seeing its underlying net profit climb by 22% to S$680 million ($797,368,000). That result was largely driven by Optus, which is SingTel's biggest revenue generator. In the third-quarter, Optus's revenue rose by 3% to S$1.86 billion (roughly $2.2 billion). SingTel also noted that its profit was boosted by its stake in India's Bharti Airtel, which saw a nearly sixfold increase in its own third-quarter net profit. SingTel expects to pay a total ordinary dividend of roughly 16.5 Singapore cents per share. By Kate Ainsworth Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says today's wages data shows the RBA's decision to cut interest rates was the right one. "The overall situation is one where inflationary pressures have been reduced quite significantly, and this explains why the RBA decided to cut the interest rate," he said. "This latest data on wages confirms that one of the main drivers of inflationary pressures, which is wages growth, is actually normalising. "Therefore I would say that, taken in context, the decision of the RBA aligns with the overall macroeconomic conditions that we observe in Australia." You can watch his full interview with finance presenter Nadia Daly below: By Kate Ainsworth Speaking in Adelaide, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has stressed that the state government's decision to put the Whyalla steelworks into administration is about protecting the plant and industry more broadly. "There was an option that we could provide assistance to GFG and Mr Gupta [owner of GFG Alliance], there was an option that we could have bailed out GFC, but we are not going to do that," he said. "This is not about GFG, this is about the critical economic infrastructure that is steelmaking production in this country. "That is the future we need to focus on, not an individual owner of the steelworks. "Our mind turns to providing support for the industry and for the people that work within it to secure sovereign steelmaking in this country, not a bailout for GFG." Our colleagues in Adelaide are covering this breaking story too — you can read more about the SA government's intervention below: By Michael Janda The wage price index is designed to measure changes in base pay — it doesn't capture the effects of promotions, overtime, more people working longer hours and other factors that will push up the pay employees actually receive. A relatively new measure of total wages does, and was also released today by the ABS. It showed that employers paid a total of $102.0 billion in wages and salaries during December 2024, which was up 5.7 per cent from $96.4 billion in December 2023. "This was slower than the growth of 7.3 per cent in December 2023, which reflects the relatively weaker labour market conditions during 2024," noted Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. "As an aggregate measure of total wages and salaries, the Monthly Employee Earnings Indicator captures all of the compositional changes in the labour market. This includes changes in employment, hours employees were paid for, pay rises and periodic payments. "It complements but is different to the measure of underlying wage growth reported in the Wage Price Index." The 5.7 per cent sounds a lot more impressive than the 3.2 per cent pay rise recorded by the WPI. But you also have to remember that the population grew roughly 2 per cent last year and an even larger proportion of the population entered the labour force. If you divide the total wages and salaries payments for December 2024 and December 2023 by the estimated number of employed persons (from the separate ABS labour force survey), then you find that wages and salaries per employee rose a much more modest 2.6%, or about $173 a month. This is very much a back-of-the-envelope calculation that compares two totally different datasets from different sources — one from the ATO's single touch payroll data, the other from the ABS labour force survey — so it is by no means an accurate estimate. However, it does serve to highlight that per person pay rises were a lot smaller than that headline 5.7% number suggests. By Kate Ainsworth Some breaking news out of Adelaide from our colleague Meagan Dillon — the Whyalla steelworks has been forced into administration by the South Australian government. Changes to the Whyalla Steel Works Act were rushed through both houses of state parliament this morning, before being signed off by the SA Governor. The steelworks, which was owned by GFG Alliance until today, has been in crisis after failing to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments to the government, and millions in unpaid bills to creditors. Just days ago, GFG Chairman Sanjeev Gupta released a statement, saying the company would sell its stake in a New South Wales coal mine to repay Whyalla creditors. "This means that GFG is no longer running the Whyalla steelworks," SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said. By Emily Stewart You will have heard by now the big four banks have passed on yesterday's Reserve Bank interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points to their variable home loan rates. But what about the smaller lenders? So far, 24 banks and credit unions have passed on the cut in full. Here's the list: Source: Canstar However, the lower rate won't be applied yet. The earliest date lenders will pass on the cut to customers is 21 February, the latest date is 7 March. By Michael Janda We're getting more reaction to the wage price index data out today from the ABS. With wages up 3.2% over the year to December while consumer prices rose 2.4%, workers enjoyed an average real pay increase over the year of 0.8%. In other words, you could by 0.8% more stuff with your base pay than a year ago (the WPI doesn't include pay increases from promotions, bonuses, etc). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) says that is a bigger increase in real wages than under nine years of the previous Coalition governments. "Wages don't just go up by accident — they are the result of campaigns by union members and the Albanese government making it easier for working Australians to collectively bargain for pay rises, stopping big business wage cutting schemes and lifting the pay of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia," argued ACTU president Michele O'Neil in a statement. But Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says Australians will need to see several more years of growing real wages to catch up on the period of high inflation post-COVID. "Adjusted for inflation, Australian wages are still 6% below their peak and, based on the latest wage and inflation forecasts from the RBA, that won't improve at all in the next two years," he wrote. "It highlights just how damaging high inflation can be and how long the recovery will be." He also believes current wage increases could result in higher inflation if they are not matched by improvements in productivity. By Emily Stewart Good afternoon! Business reporter Emily Stewart jumping in here to let you know what's happening on the local sharemarket. Another lacklustre day on the markets so far, with the ASX 200 down 0.4 per cent to 8,444 points and the broader All Ordinaries down about the same amount to 8,725 points (as at 12.35pm AEDT). The worst performing sector today is financials, with NAB down as much as 8.6 per cent, after a disappointing first-quarter earning result. CBA is also in the red (perhaps because it is trading ex-dividend today). Here are the top and bottom movers so far today: By Kate Ainsworth That's the assessment of the latest wages data from Professor Fabrizio Carmignani at the University of Southern Queensland. He told finance presenter Nadia Daly on ABC News Channel that the slowing pace of wages growth is unusual to see with historically low levels of unemployment in the economy. "What we have observed over the last several quarters is a decline in the rate at which wages are growing," he said. "What we have observed is that progressive easing of labour market conditions, which is consistent with declining wage growth. "I would say that unemployment outcomes that we had for the fourth quarter of 2024 was a bit surprising in this sense, probably there was the expectation that unemployment would be a bit higher, instead it continues to be very low. "So we are indeed observing, I would say, a progressive easing of labour market conditions, although unemployment still is performing at its lowest level. "It's an interesting dynamic in the labour market, absolutely." By Michael Janda After today's decision to cut the overnight cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 3.75%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says it expects to keep cutting at future meetings. "If economic conditions continue to evolve as projected, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further through 2025," the bank's monetary policy committee said in its post-meeting press release. That's a contrast to the RBA's communications, which very much played down the extent of further rate cuts after yesterday's initial move to 4.1%. But New Zealand is arguably a bit further ahead in its battle against inflation. "Annual consumer price inflation remains near the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band," the statement notes. "Firms' inflation expectations are at target and core inflation continues to fall towards the target midpoint. "The economic outlook remains consistent with inflation remaining in the band over the medium term, giving the Committee confidence to continue lowering the OCR." But it has come at a cost. Unemployment in New Zealand is at 5.1%, even after tens of thousands of unemployed Kiwis crossed the ditch to Australia over the past year or so. The economy has basically been stuck in recession for the past 18 months, with several quarters of negative or zero growth, including a contraction over the last six months of 2024. That makes this line in the RBNZ's statement seem a piece of artful understatement. "Economic activity in New Zealand remains subdued. "With spare productive capacity, domestic inflation pressures continue to ease. Price and wage setting behaviours are adapting to a low-inflation environment. The price of imports has fallen, also contributing to lower headline inflation." But the RBNZ is hopeful of an economic revival this year. "Lower interest rates will encourage spending, although elevated global economic uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment decisions," the bank's monetary policy committee expects. "Higher prices for some of our key commodities and a lower exchange rate will increase export revenues. Employment growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the domestic economy recovers." If the RBNZ proves too optimistic, New Zealanders looking for work may be left pining for the fjords (or a plane ticket to Australia). By Michael Janda No surprises here. The RBNZ has lowered its cash rate target by 0.5 of a percentage point to 3.75%, as expected by economists and financial traders. By Michael Janda The slowdown in annual wages growth to 3.2% over the year to December was in line with forecasts the RBA published yesterday as it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The ABS wage price index was also in line with most economist forecasts. However, if you look at the RBA's November forecasts, it expected stronger wages growth of 3.4%. Go back further still to the set of forecasts before that, from August, and the RBA was expecting 3.6% wage growth for the year to December 2024. So that's a massive downward revision in the space of just six months. The RBA's economics department has a lengthy track record of consistently overestimating wages growth, including for many years prior to the pandemic. Perhaps they need to have another look at their economic models and the assumptions baked into them to find out where they are going wrong. (To be fair to the RBA, they are doing this, for example this recent research paper which draws on the experience of one of the new board members who was a Fair Work president.). My guess is that the private sector economists who believe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is somewhere closer to 4% rather than the RBA's estimate of about 4.5% may be on the money. After all, if wages growth is decelerating with unemployment at 4% and many other indicators of an apparently "tight" labour market, perhaps those levels are not really that "tight" at all? Why should we care if the RBA's models are wrong? Because if wages growth keeps coming in below forecasts — and the RBA expects a re-acceleration back to 3.4% for the year to June — then it can probably afford to cut interest rates more than it currently expects to. By Samuel Yang Shares of oil and gas producer Santos fall as much as 2.2% to $6.74, last down 2% The company posted lower-than-expected FY underlying profit of $US1.20 billion, a 16% decrease from a year ago, hurt by lower realised prices and slowing production. Stock fell 12.1% in 2024. By Michael Janda The Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its latest wage price index (WPI). And, even though unemployment is near multi-decade lows at 4%, wage growth keeps falling sharply. Base pay grew just 3.2% over the year to December, down from 3.6% over the year to September and 4.1% over the year to June. It's a very rapid deceleration. "The 0.7 per cent rise this quarter was the equal lowest growth since March quarter 2022," said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. "At 3.2 per cent, the annual increase in wages was down from 4.2 per cent in December quarter 2023 and is the equal lowest since September quarter 2022." By Samuel Yang The Australian share market has opened sharply lower, tracking losses on Wall Street. The ASX 200 index was down 85 points or 1 per cent to 8,396 by 10:27am AEDT, with financials (-2.5pc) and real estate (-1.7pc) leading the losses. Here are the top and bottom movers at open.

Title: Whale watch: Reddit stock has nearly tripled in recent months, and one major hedge fund made a $1 billion bet last quarter as it soared
URL: https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/reddit-stock-coatue-management-stake-hedge-fund-13f-rddt-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-18T20:35:59Z
Full Content:
A closely followed hedge fund bet big on Reddit stock last quarter. Coatue Management, a hedge fund led by former Tiger Management employee Philippe Laffont, reported a 6.5 million share stake in the social media company in its latest 13F. The filing, made with the SEC last week and as of December 31, revealed that the nearly $1.1 billion Reddit stake made up about 3.6% of Coatue's $59 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund returned 19% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's gain of about 23%. The hedge fund's recently established stake in the social media company has already proven profitable if it has held onto the shares so far this year. Based on current prices, Coatue's Reddit stake is worth about $1.2 billion, representing a year-to-date gain of $141 million, assuming the hedge fund is still holding onto the stock. While the exact price the fund paid for the stock is not known, shares of Reddit have surged 14% since in 2025 and are up 193% in the last five months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has returned 4% year-to-date. Reddit's big gains over the past few months were driven by a strong third-quarter earnings report released in late October. The company revealed a surprise profit, year-over-year revenue growth of 68%, and a 47% surge in daily active users. The stock peaked at about $228 per share on February 10 and has declined about 20% since then. Investors are still digesting Reddit's fourth-quarter earnings results from last week, which revealed a 52% surge in expenses and a traffic hiccup due to a change in Google's search engine. "We expect Reddit to continue making progress across its full-funnel diversification while delivering strong revenue growth & improved profitability," analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent note, adding that future changes to Google search are a longer-term risk. The bank rates Reddit at "Neutral" and believes it is trading at about fair value with a $185 price target. Other significant moves made by Coatue during the fourth quarter included a broad sell-off of its Chinese stock holdings and newly established positions in Charles Schwab, Affirm, Okta, and Datadog. The hedge fund's three largest holdings as of December 31 were Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment.

LGBTQA+ pride flags in the Google sign to celebrate Gay Pride Month, Manhattan, New York. (Photo by: ... [+] Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When I was younger, I had a lovely older neighbor who’d graduated from Harvard as a historian at a time when there was deep antisemitism. He’d share facts and printed old newspaper articles he’d preserved over the years to remind me of the many ways that businesses of every size turned a blind eye to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and significantly profited off of it. All of this makes the head-spinning declarations of loyalty to the Trump Administration that many companies have shown in recent weeks rather curious. Businesses ranging from Google to Meta to Target who once rushed to embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “initiatives” and celebrate Black History Month have rushed to erase signs of solidarity following the Administration’s various Executive Orders. Many consumers and shareholders feel betrayed. Small businesses and startup entrepreneurs who take their cues from corporations and big tech could be impacted by this sentiment too. But, when corporate practices are unpopular there is an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should consider consumer’s values and prepare to position their companies to meet the moment and stay viable as more and more people are purchasing products from businesses that align with their principles. A new Harris poll found that four in 10 Americans have shifted spending to align with their moral views in recent months. Specifically the poll results highlighted: Further, several of Target’s shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company on January 24, after the company said it would end DEI initiatives this year, including a program to support Black-owned small businesses that it adopted following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. This betrayal shouldn’t surprise anyone who has cracked open a history book. In the 1930s Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis. IBM supplied the numeric codes tattooed on those ushered into the gas chambers. And Bayer –the aspirin company– is the reincarnation of IG Farben; a huge donor to Nazi political campaigns, a manufacturing beneficiary of Hitler’s invasions of European countries, and a shareholder in the company that produced the gas the Nazis used to exterminate millions of people. Horrifically, the Holocaust’s atrocities turned out to be a whole lot less interesting to the corporate world than how it could be used to profit their businesses. And as Succession’s Shiv Roy declared in a scene with a potential whistleblower: “We don’t get embarrassed.” Let’s run some numbers on where America is and why embracing difference and the uniqueness of people’s lived experiences matters. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s good for businesses’ bottom line too, and especially for startups and small businesses who rely on forging customer brand loyalty in their early days in crowded markets. The US Presidential election between Trump and Harris was extremely close. For votes counted through November 20th, Trump’s margin over Harris was only 1.62%, according to PBS. On a percentage basis, Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960. Another contributing factor to the election results is that voter purges have been on the rise election over election and purges historically impact people of color, especially Black voters, according to the NYT. Furthermore, the non-partisan organization League of Women Voters, as of November 6, 2024, tracked 64 anti-voter lawsuits filed in 2024 that sought to sow distrust in the election. Factor in the recent YouGov poll which found that 19 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 abandoned Harris in 2024, and one-third of those cited the war in Gaza in their decision. It was the top reason provided, beating out the economy and immigration, costing Harris more than 6 million votes. In states that swung from Biden to Trump in 2024, 20% cited Gaza in their decision to abstain from voting entirely. Bottom line: Trump did not win the election by a landslide and the majority of people in the US don’t support fascism or authoritarianism. Even current polls show Trump’s popularity with voters sitting at only 47%. People want to support politicians and businesses that align with their values. And that is exactly what many people are now doing so businesses and entrepreneurs everywhere need to stand with the majority. The widely reported mass user exodus from X to alternative startup platforms such as Bluesky has been accelerating steadily and bleeding money from X. The platform has become so alarming to several major advertisers that Elon Musk has mounted multiple lawsuits alleging boycotts. Since Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party a month ago, Tesla’s sales are tanking across Europe. In some countries like Spain, Tesla’s sales are down as much as 75% year-over-year. The stock price is also down with analysts saying that Tesla’s favorability rating is nearing all-time lows and that this could hurt near-term sales. The unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. Target’s share price took a steep hit after eliminating DEI initiatives that its own shareholders have filed a lawsuit charging it with fraud. Meanwhile, Costco’s share price is up almost 15% after refusing such rollbacks (a decision backed by 98% of voting shares). Costco also has reported a surge in memberships compared to Sam’s Club which is facing declining memberships. “It’s a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector,” noted the Harris poll. While a mass exodus from a platform like Meta could be logistically challenging –not least because the US represents such a small percentage of its user base– and such a move has yet to materialize, it would be folly to dismiss it out of hand. More and more users are questioning Meta’s commitment to fighting disinformation and online harassment. As the US TikTok ban loomed, users swarmed to Chinese alternative RedNote, signaling both an appetite and capacity for swift mass mobilization. Such a mass abandonment of Facebook or Instagram alone would have tectonic financial implications, and not just for Meta; the carnage would cascade through the millions of businesses including many small businesses that depend on its advertising model. Even the threat of such shifts could trigger investor anxiety with consequences comparable to past service outages – a 5% dip in share price, equivalent to about $47 billion in losses. Target’s shareholders have already set a precedent for how this might happen. Ultimately, what the numbers tell us is that while some of the biggest companies are lining up to abandon their DEI policies to do business with the Trump Administration, they may find themselves at odds with their customer base who have very different lived experiences and will put their money where their mouth is. This reckless lack of foresight by CEOs should alarm shareholders because it’s consumers who hold the power of the purse. And small businesses and entrepreneurs should seize this opportunity to drive their operations strategy. Because without customers their businesses will cease to exist. *Disclosure: I was previously on the Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters.

Title: Why Intel must stay independent, spin out its foundry and rebuild its iconic brand

UPDATED 18:28 EST / FEBRUARY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel Corp. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing — an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core central processing unit design business — a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine — remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Reports swirl that Broadcom Inc. might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. In this Special Breaking Analysis, we examine why Intel’s design business can — and should — remain an independent powerhouse once the company spins out its foundry operations. We’ll walk through how a spinout might unfold, including an updated scenario from our original bold plan in which TSMC anchors a U.S.-domiciled joint venture. We’ll also detail why the foundry must command a massive discount — perhaps as deep as 90% to 100% of Intel’s sunk investment — and how a “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase model from hyperscale cloud providers (Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp.) can sustain a new American-based foundry while freeing Intel to focus on design excellence. Along the way, we’ll explore the role of advanced nodes such as Intel’s much-touted 18A, and dissect why we feel the assumptions of intellectual property value around 18A might not be as viable as the pundits say. We hope to convey why all these moves serve a broader purpose: to maintain robust competition, fortify national security and preserve an American chip design champion. Intel’s integrated manufacturing strategy was once a key differentiator. By aligning design and process technology in tandem, Intel could produce new microprocessors at a pace the rest of the industry struggled to match. But TSMC’s rise — fueled by enormous wafer volumes from Arm-based mobile processors and an unwavering focus on manufacturing excellence — has left Intel behind in advanced process nodes. The capital intensity of staying competitive at the leading edge has skyrocketed, and Intel’s foundry efforts have yet to attract sufficient scale or external customers. Pat Gelsinger’s return as chief executive initially reignited optimism for a U.S.-based advanced manufacturing renaissance. But the delays in Intel’s roadmap, the cost overruns in ramping new nodes, and the persistence of TSMC’s leadership suggest that Intel’s foundry plan remains outgunned. Meanwhile, the design side of Intel’s house — responsible for everything from x86 CPUs for PCs and servers to emerging artificial intelligence accelerators — still has enormous potential. The problem is that this potential remains shackled by the continuous drain of Intel’s foundry ambitions. For more context, read our Critical Analysis on the Root Cause of Intel’s Troubles. Reports of Broadcom acquiring Intel’s design business reflect a short-term mindset. Broadcom has built its empire through acquisition, focusing on cost efficiencies and leveraging synergies across enterprise software, networking and semiconductors. Intel in many ways would fit Broadcom’s strategy of acquiring durable businesses. Handing over Intel’s CPU design business — a bedrock of American microprocessor leadership — would inevitably concentrate more market power. That’s not only a threat to healthy competition; it risks overshadowing Intel’s legacy and future innovation. Given the heightened scrutiny on tech mergers and acquisitions by both U.S. and international regulators, a Broadcom-Intel design merger could and should face drawn-out investigations or outright rejection. Moreover, Intel’s stock price is depressed compared with historical peaks, in no small part because of the drag from manufacturing. Why sell the design arm now, when it’s arguably at a cyclical low? Once the foundry baggage is removed and Intel’s design group can stand on its own merits — much like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. did when it spun off GlobalFoundries — there’s every possibility for a resurgence. Selling at the bottom of the cycle would shortchange shareholders and kill an iconic brand that still has real technological capital. Intel’s board owes it to shareholders, employees and the broader tech industry to keep the design business independent. Yes, the integrated manufacturing approach has proven costly, and yes, the foundry is likely a negative-value asset as it stands. But there is precedent for this kind of strategic realignment: IBM Corp. paid GlobalFoundries to take its microelectronics division in 2014. AMD separated its fabs in 2009 and eventually became a formidable design-centric competitor. Today, AMD relies on TSMC to manufacture its designs at leading-edge nodes. With the money drain from manufacturing gone, AMD could focus on architectural innovation — an effort that has paid off handsomely. In the same vein, Intel can rebuild its design brand and engineering culture once it is liberated from the massive overhead of running advanced-node fabs. The board shouldn’t tap out and sell the design side to a competitor; it should step up and ensure that an iconic American brand continues to innovate in CPUs, graphics processing units, AI and custom silicon markets. Intel in our view has no choice but to exit manufacturing. To spin out foundry will likely require a substantial discount — some might even call it “paying someone to take it off their hands.” In 2014, IBM effectively wrote GlobalFoundries a large check to absorb its microelectronics business, transferring factories, employees and IP. Intel’s foundry operations have consumed billions in capital with underwhelming yields and missed process milestones. Critics may point to 18A as a potential game-changer, but the reality is that 18A is behind schedule, unproven and not generating revenue. To entice a partner such as TSMC to operate these fabs in the U.S., Intel must accept that much of its capital investment will not be recovered. A 90% to 100% discount relative to the book value of Intel’s foundry assets may sound extreme, yet it’s not unprecedented when the alternative is ongoing, multibillion-dollar losses. This is the cost of a strategic reset. Intel has touted 18A as the company’s hope to leapfrog TSMC. But each roadmap slip erodes market confidence and 18A’s negative profitability was never going to allow Intel to catch TSMC with this node. The deeper truth is that the real wave of future manufacturing innovation was more likely with what Intel calls 14A (or some iteration of that node) — combining backside power delivery, gate-all-around and next-generation High-NA EUV in a more mature process window. We’ve always said this was an extremely risky and unproven endeavor but in the unlikely event Intel could pull it off, it would have likely represented a leapfrog in process relative to TSMC. But the probability of success in a reasonable timeframe was always very low. However, 14A in the JV’s hands under TSMC’s guidance would likely be more fruitful. Because it has profitable advanced nodes already, it could take its time with 14A rather than trying to catch up in desperation. TSMC has the financial and operational discipline to integrate new techniques properly. If TSMC is part of a U.S.-domiciled JV, it can exercise that discipline on what remains of Intel’s advanced node R&D while leveraging some of Intel’s IP. In this scenario, 14A would find a more reliable steward in TSMC than Intel’s own cash-strapped and time-pressured foundry operation. The likely scenario is a joint venture — wholly based in the United States — where TSMC contributes expertise, intellectual property and skilled engineering teams deployed stateside. Unlike typical equity investments, TSMC might not contribute much upfront cash. Instead, it would bring intangible but invaluable process know-how, yield ramp experience and world-class manufacturing talent. The U.S. government’s CHIPS Act funds could partially offset capital expenses, while private equity players provide debt financing backstopped by either Washington or the JV’s assets. Under this arrangement, Intel’s foundry assets and workforce transfer to the JV. TSMC becomes the majority stakeholder or at least the primary operator, ensuring that day-to-day manufacturing decisions align with TSMC’s methodology. Intel, for its part, might retain a minority stake but cede operational control — effectively paying to hand over the reins to the world’s most competent foundry operator. The discount on Intel’s assets is baked into the deal; it reflects the expensive truth that Intel’s fabs have negative economic value unless someone can turn them around. Below is a revised and simplified version of our original CAP table: One of the greatest hurdles for a newly spun-out foundry is securing enough volume to achieve economies of scale. TSMC thrives on huge wafer starts from Apple, MediaTek Inc., AMD, Nvidia and many others. Intel’s x86 business alone won’t provide the necessary volume, especially if it’s behind TSMC’s own leading-edge processes. So, the solution is to bring in the U.S. hyperscalers — AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Nvidia, the U.S. military and others — that each have a vested interest in: By structuring multiyear “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase contracts, the hyperscalers guarantee consistent demand regardless of yield ramp challenges. This arrangement underwrites the JV’s operational costs during the toughest early years. The “take-or-pay” concept means that if yields remain low or the node is behind TSMC’s mainstream lines for a while, these cloud giants still pay for the capacity. In return, they get guaranteed supply when (and if) the JV’s yields improve, plus the political goodwill of being seen as partners in securing U.S. semiconductor independence. The crux of this model is that the guaranteed demand from hyperscalers offsets the typical scale disadvantage a new foundry would face. This approach also dovetails with the government’s desire to see advanced node manufacturing thrive on U.S. soil, thereby reducing national security risks tied to any instability in Asia. The internet giants are placing large, multiyear bets on American silicon. But it’s not a classic equity investment. Instead, each of these firms would be committing to substantial “take-or-pay” wafer agreements, locking in critical supply for advanced semiconductors without the long wait for a traditional equity return on investment. In exchange, the U.S. government would take its foot off the necks of these companies in the form of relaxed regulatory pressure and onerous oversight. For years, Apple and the hyperscalers have relied almost exclusively on TSMC’s Taiwanese fabs. That’s understandable — TSMC is the gold standard in advanced node manufacturing. But rising geopolitical tensions underscore the risk of tying all capacity to a single region. By participating in a new U.S.-based JV, these companies gain a dependable second source for high-performance chips, hedging against sudden disruptions. From iPhone systems-on-chip to AI accelerators, every hyperscaler wants an uninterrupted flow of silicon. Being first to market with new AI and machine learning capabilities or next-generation consumer devices can mean the difference between industry leadership and playing catch-up. A domestic advanced node foundry, even if initially lagging TSMC’s bleeding edge by a half-step, gives these firms a crucial foothold in American-made chips — a prospect that has become priceless. What do these hyperscalers get beyond supply assurance? A more predictable regulatory climate. In Washington, the appetite to scrutinize Big Tech — whether over antitrust, privacy or monopolistic practices — has only grown. Committing massive wafer prepayments to a strategic U.S. foundry aligns their corporate goals with the government’s national interests. By no means are we suggesting these firms get a total regulatory pass. But the sheer scale of their take-or-pay deals supports America’s push for domestic semiconductor leadership, buying goodwill and tempering how aggressively regulators wield the antitrust hammer. For these companies, predictability in the legal arena translates into billions of dollars in strategic value. Moreover, the U.S. government in our scenario would pressure EU regulators to back off as well, in exchange for a more stable supply chain for advanced silicon. Since the U.S. is funding the future of silicon, it has the moral authority to pressure EU regulators to moderate their anti-Big Tech stance against U.S. companies. By opting for wafer guarantees rather than equity stakes, the hyperscalers sidestep the classic venture capital pitfall of waiting a decade for payback. Every one of these companies is in constant need of leading-edge silicon; paying upfront for guaranteed capacity isn’t just a hedge, it’s an essential input to their day-to-day business. So unlike a typical long-horizon investment, these wafer commitments deliver near-term strategic value: a stable supply of advanced chips to fuel growth in AI, cloud services, consumer devices and more. In return, the new foundry scores sustained demand. Even if early yields lag behind TSMC’s global best, the arrangement smooths out the revenue cycle while the JV works to improve yield and process maturity. It’s a symbiotic setup: Big Tech gets supply and the foundry gets a stable customer base and a realistic shot at scale. Apple Apple has long been TSMC’s shining star, but a single point of manufacturing failure is no longer tenable. Diversifying to a domestic foundry paves the way for second-source security across iPhone, iPad and Mac chips. Over the long haul, Apple might also co-develop next-gen packaging lines at the JV, ensuring it retains a competitive edge in device performance. AWS AWS is hungry for capacity for its Graviton CPUs, Trainium and Inferentia AI chips, plus whatever HPC solutions loom on the horizon. And there’s a regulatory carrot: If Amazon helps secure U.S. semiconductor leadership, the government will commit to soften scrutiny around its e-commerce dominance. Google Google Cloud’s TPU programs demand advanced silicon to power AI/ML workloads at large scale. A domestic foundry removes the uncertainty of Taiwanese supply lines and the U.S. government would agree to lessen its scrutiny around data privacy or large-scale acquisitions. Predictability here is priceless for a company whose approach is “move fast and innovate.” Microsoft Microsoft’s diverse product suite spans cloud hardware, AI chips (Project Athena) and even Xbox SoCs. A stake in U.S.-based capacity can deflect the usual antitrust chatter around Office and Windows bundling. The real boon is ensuring timely access to advanced nodes for its AI and console businesses. Meta Meta faces heavy scrutiny on social media policy and data privacy. Securing advanced-node chips for AI inference, training, and upcoming AR/VR headsets is mission-critical. Making big wafer commitments demonstrates goodwill that could soften regulators’ stances on everything from user data to content moderation. Nvidia As the go-to provider of GPUs for AI and gaming, Nvidia constantly grapples with supply shortages — and no one knows that better than data center customers. Having a domestic fab option helps shield against overseas risk and further ingratiates Nvidia to U.S. policymakers, potentially smoothing the road for future expansions or acquisitions. Additional stakeholders in this model could include the U.S. military, Qualcomm Inc., Tesla Inc., MediaTek, AMD and possibly IBM, which could also contribute IP from its advanced research in chips. A U.S.-based advanced foundry JV, underpinned by these massive “take-or-pay” agreements, is more than a financial arrangement. It’s an ecosystem-level deal that ties the fortunes of Big Tech to America’s semiconductor resurgence. Each hyperscaler hedges against global uncertainty and gains a modicum of regulatory relief in the process. Meanwhile, the JV secures guaranteed demand from day one — enough to build momentum toward competitive yields, node maturity and long-term viability. In short, this is a bet on stability — geopolitical, operational and regulatory — and at a time when advanced silicon has become the oil of the digital economy. We believe that’s an investment well worth making. Total Upfront Payments: $25 billion Total Milestone Payments: $19 billion Grand Total: $44 billion (over five years) Note: These figures are illustrative to show a hypothetical scale. They should be adjusted based on overall fab construction costs, negotiated TSMC licensing fees, and a reasonable node volume. This structure gives the new American Foundry approximately $100 billion in capital over a five-year period. With TSMC’s leadership, process expertise and talent injection it dramatically increases the chances of having a viable advanced semiconductor manufacturing source on U.S. shores with a U.S.-domiciled company. Once the foundry is spun out, Intel can refocus on its core: designing innovative CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and custom silicon solutions. By removing the financial and managerial overhead of manufacturing, Intel’s leadership can redeploy cash toward R&D in architecture, software stacks, packaging innovation and go-to-market partnerships. A streamlined Intel might look a lot like AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm — fabless (or fab-lite) — yet able to bring advanced chip designs to market quickly by tapping TSMC’s best processes. Intel could still have preferential access to the newly created JV, securing capacity for its own x86 lines at better rates or guaranteed volumes. But if that JV lags TSMC’s mainline by too much, Intel’s design arm could also choose to go direct to TSMC’s Taiwan fabs or Samsung’s foundries. This freedom would be an enormous boost to Intel’s competitiveness. No longer chained to a sub-scale manufacturing model, Intel design engineers can choose whichever advanced node best suits the product timeline and competitive environment. An independent Intel design division also satisfies the concerns of regulators who fear large-scale consolidation. Selling the design arm to Broadcom would add to the wave of semiconductor M&A that the government is already carefully scrutinizing. By staying independent, Intel remains a distinct competitor in CPU, HPC and AI markets. The U.S. Department of Defense also gains because Intel can keep focusing on specialized designs for defense-related applications, while the new JV foundry (with TSMC stewardship) handles secure manufacturing on American soil. It’s a synergy that retains critical R&D in the United States, fosters multiple points of competition, and ensures a stable supply chain for military and civilian infrastructure. TSMC has already broken ground on fabs in Arizona, though it has struggled with costs and workforce challenges. Critics question whether TSMC will allocate its best technology to U.S. sites. In the proposed JV scenario, TSMC could opt to transfer a slightly older node to ensure it retains absolute leadership in Taiwan. The new entity might operate at “N-1” levels of technology. Yet for many hyperscaler workloads — such as server CPUs, AI inference chips or specialized accelerators — being a generation behind might be acceptable when weighed against the security of local supply. Over a decade, with guaranteed volume and financial stability, that JV could close some of the gap if TSMC invests in incremental process improvements. One could argue that the U.S. government wants Intel to succeed as a standalone integrated manufacturer. But the repeated delays and huge losses reveal that Intel won’t ever catch up to TSMC alone (without unlimited capital and time). The CHIPS Act aims to ensure advanced node capacity exists in the U.S., not necessarily that Intel remains integrated if that model is doomed to fail. A TSMC-led JV, operating on U.S. soil, employing tens of thousands of Americans, and financed partly by Big Tech’s wafer prepayments, meets the spirit of the CHIPS Act. For the government, it’s a pragmatic solution to ensure advanced manufacturing doesn’t vanish entirely from American shores. A valid concern is that Intel might lose its “co-optimization” advantage by spinning out manufacturing. But the success of AMD, Nvidia and Apple’s silicon team indicates that close partnerships with TSMC can achieve better results than a sub-scale in-house approach. Intel’s advanced packaging technologies (such as EMIB and Foveros) can be licensed to or co-developed with TSMC under commercial agreements. As an independent design entity, Intel can become more nimble, not less. Take-or-pay contracts assume that advanced node yields will improve over time. Early yields might be poor. The hyperscalers, however, get two things they value: guaranteed capacity (even if it’s behind TSMC’s leading edge) and better regulatory standing with the government. Over the long haul, if yields are too low and the JV fails, the hyperscalers would still have TSMC’s mainline in Taiwan (or Samsung) as a fallback. Because these are multiyear deals, the JV has enough runway to fix process issues, guided by TSMC’s real-world experience. Rather than ceding its legacy to Broadcom or any other suitor, Intel should embrace a strategic pivot that upholds competition, national security and the spirit of American innovation. The steps are clear, albeit not easy: Intel’s board is under pressure to deliver shareholder value in the wake of ongoing foundry failures. Selling Intel’s design business to Broadcom might look like a quick fix, but it would sacrifice a venerable American brand at the lowest point of its valuation — an outcome that undermines competition, national security and the legacy of one of tech’s greatest innovators. We believe it is incumbent on this board, which oversaw the flawed IDM 2.0 strategy, to preserve Intel as an independent entity and support the hard work it will take to give rebirth to this American icon. The visionary and entirely viable route is to spin out the foundry, swallow the painful discount, and let Intel’s design house flourish independently. We’ve seen the positive results of such a strategy with AMD, which soared after distancing itself from foundry headaches. With a TSMC-led joint venture offering a U.S.-based alternative to Taiwan’s facilities — and hyperscalers incentivized to prepay for wafer volume — this scenario provides a lifeline for advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. It keeps Intel relevant in the CPU, GPU and AI arenas. It aligns with government aims for robust competition and supply chain security. And it ensures that “Intel Inside” remains more than just a memory. In short, Intel’s next chapter need not be defined by a desperate sale to a conglomerate. The foundry spinout is a bitter pill, but once swallowed, it could liberate Intel’s design prowess for decades to come — reestablishing it as a powerhouse of American innovation, sustaining competition across the CPU and AI markets, and serving as a keystone in the broader effort to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing leadership. It’s a vision that demands courage from Intel’s board, patience from its shareholders, and cooperation from the U.S. government and partners like TSMC and the hyperscalers — but one that could ultimately salvage Intel’s future as an iconic force in technology.

Title: Tech Insider: A big move ahead of Spark’s earnings, more Callaghan ‘chaos’, Southlander’s start-up raises A$5m – and who is NZ’s DOGE-master?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. An investment fund backs up the truck ahead of Spark’s half-year earnings on Friday. An insider details Callaghan ‘chaos’ as the agency enters its defunding death spiral. An Invercargill-born entrepreneur scores A$5 million for his start-up. It’s 3am Eternal for owners of US shares who’ve gained access to extended trading. And an authoritative poll reveals who could lead a DOGE-like initiative in NZ - or not. Ahead of its half-year earnings this Friday, some analysts and fund managers still rate Spark a “sell”. Others say it’s been beaten down so far its shares are a “buy”. ACC has just revealed it is in Camp Buy. Our state accident insurer’s investment wing – which has leaned tech-sceptic over the past couple of years, compared to our other Crown giant, the NZ Super Fund – disclosed on February 13 that it had topped up its stake in Spark to just above the 5% major holding threshold between October 12 and February 12 by purchasing $52.2 million worth of Spark shares on the NZX and A$27.5m ($30m) worth on the ASX. Craigs is Camp Sell – or at least it put Spark in its bad books as its earnings preview clumped NZX firms into positive, neutral and negative piles. After an unusual miss for its full-year earnings, delivered last August, Spark surprised again – and again in a bad way – by lowering its FY2025 guidance in October. Craigs says there is “some chance of a further downgrade” but that this possibility is already built into the telco’s price. “A key focus will be on FCF [free cashflow] cover for dividends and the extent to which the current weakness is macro-driven or due to increased competition.” In other words, how much of a poor result could be pinned on the crummy economy and Government IT departments shelving their chequebooks, and how much can down to post-merger 2degrees being on a roll? Morningstar’s Brian Han says investors have over-sold, and Spark represents good buying as long as it sees through cost-cutting. Forsyth Barr analysts Aaron Ibbotson and Benjamin Crozier, who downgraded Spark to “underperform” on February 14, with a $2.80 12-month target (shares closed Friday at $2.90), said there is “potential for a restructuring charge to be pulled out of its ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] guidance”. The pair also want an update on the capital-raising push announced at Spark’s full-year result in August, when chair Justine Smyth said the telco would explore various options to raise $1b for data-centre expansion over the next five years. They want to see a construction timeline, too. A Callaghan Innovation insider alleges potential issues with commercial contracts and an ongoing hazchem disposal issues Some 350 Callaghan Innovation staff already know their agency is going to lose its funding on June 30 – with some jobs going to other agencies, if on a lag of up to six months, with enabling legislation for science sector changes not due before Parliament before the fourth quarter and not coming into effect until next year. Callaghan offers research services for early-stage firms and developers of new technologies, and administers growth grants and the Government’s tax rebate for R&D. Earlier this month, the Public Service Association said Callaghan staff did not know who would get a role with another agency under a sweeping science sector restructure or when – leading some to look offshore for work in what the union says is a “brain-drain of the Government’s own making”. Late last week, a Callaghan staffer – whose name has been withheld – wrote to the Herald about what they saw as “the chaos and widespread damage caused by the Government’s decision to disestablish this vital department. Most of us were told of the closure only on the morning the press release went out, leaving staff completely stunned and unprepared”. “I would like to particularly highlight the significant losses and the catastrophic consequences of the lack of planning surrounding this enormous decision. The situation at Callaghan is an utter shambles and it’s clear that nothing has been properly thought out. From the perspective of both staff and many established customers, it feels as though the Government is attempting to fly a plane while it is still being built,” the staffer wrote. “For example, no one at Callaghan knows when their final paycheque will come. Only the 80 staff members who were given four weeks’ notice on February 12 – mostly from the research & development team, business innovation advisors and some internal functions like marketing – have any certainty. For everyone else, there is no clarity on when we will be let go, except that it will happen in ‘waves’. “This lack of detailed information has serious consequences for employees’ ability to plan for the future and, more importantly, their mental health.” They continued: “The Gracefield [research] site has received no direction on what will happen next. Staff are being forced to figure out not only how to manage the loss of staff but also how to dispose of chemicals and other scientific materials safely. The risk of legal and compliance issues resulting from this poor planning is substantial and the administrative cost of unwinding this hasty and poorly managed shutdown will only increase over time.” Last year, a leaked memo said hazardous goods storage is not up to scratch in some of Callaghan’s laboratories, with $120m in remediatory work required over the next five years. In a letter of expectations leaked to the Herald earlier this month, new Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Shane Reti instructed Callaghan to “explore commercial opportunities to retain the Gracefield site as a centre for science and innovation” – presumably for the yet-to-be-detailed public research organisation envisioned by the Government. The staffer continued: “Callaghan scientists also undertake critical scientific research under contract for numerous businesses. “These contracts often extend well beyond the June disestablishment date, leaving customers in limbo, unsure of who, if anyone, will be able to carry on their commercial work. “Many of these businesses are now facing serious challenges, with expensive and time-sensitive R&D work halted with no plan for how to proceed. The scientists working on these projects are highly specialised and their expertise cannot be easily replaced.” Tech Insider put the staffer’s comments to Callaghan chief executive Stefan Korn. “I know this is a difficult and distressing time for our people. We’re working at pace to give staff and customers certainty about how the disestablishment of the organisation will affect them,” Korn replied. “However, winding up an organisation as complicated as Callaghan Innovation is not straightforward. We have multiple challenges to work through, including the transfer of some functions to other entities, the shutdown of other parts of the organisation and the safe and effective management of the Gracefield Innovation Quarter [GIQ]. “For example, planning work is now under way to safely deal with the disposal of a large range of chemicals and hazardous substances that have been used by the scientists at GIQ over the years.” Korn added: “As much as we would’ve liked to give people answers on day one, it’s important to work through the detail and get things right. “We’re doing everything we can to support our people and customers in this transition.” “The science sector reforms aim to ensure we focus our investment that will generate greatest value for our economy and our people,” Reti said. “Callaghan Innovation was spread too thin across many conflicting functions – it’s struggled to work to a clear focused purpose. “To better support and incentivise innovation for economic growth, we have decided to disestablish Callaghan Innovation and establish a new Public Research Organisation [PRO] to focus on delivering research in AI [artificial intelligence], synthetic biology, aerospace, medical and quantum technologies. “Some of Callaghan’s functions will be transferred to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] or the new PRO. “Some functions will not be transferred, so an in-principle decision has been made for the funding to be reallocated. “I understand that in this round of change, the board of Callaghan Innovation has considered roles that aren’t currently working on customer contracts. “I acknowledge that these changes will be challenging for staff involved. I am confident that the science reforms ... will strengthen our science system and create more opportunities for economic growth over time.” Earlier this month, Callaghan senior research scientist Ben Wylie-van Eerd told the Herald that while the Government had outlined plans for a new advanced technology research organisation, the lack of a firm timeline – other than a legislative timetable indicating it was at least six months away, and probably more – meant a lot of his colleagues were already job-hunting for offshore roles. Trump’s talking up more tariffs. Ukraine is offering the US priority access to lithium as it bargains for its life. Think Tesla’s going to have a good day? Now you place a punt before the Nasdaq’s opening bell. Trading platform CMC recently launched extended-hours trading on the “Magnificent Seven” stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla). The move proved so popular that CMC has now increased the breadth of extended hours trading to 80 popular US stocks, CMC’s Markets New Zealand general manager Chris Smith says. Kiwis can start pre-market trading from 10pm NZT, well before the US stock exchanges open at 3.30am NZT. “We’ve seen recently that international news can have a major impact on markets and we want to give our investors the best opportunity to react as fast as they can,” Smith told Tech Insider. Invercargill-raised Derek Troy-West has raised A$5m at a $A25m valuation for the software start-up he founded with his wife. Troy-West did a computer science degree at Auckland University then worked as a software developer for Spark before heading to the UK for a few years, where he met his wife Kylie Forge (now Kylie Troy-West), an Australian also on her OE after graduating from La Trobe. The pair settled back in Melbourne in 2012 and founded Factor House in 2019. The start-up builds developer tools that allow engineers to manage the processing of massive amounts of real-time data. Its first product, Kpow, is an engineering toolkit designed to enhance and simplify the management of Kafka – an open-source distributed-event-streaming platform developed by LinkedIn that allows data to be transported efficiently and accurately between different systems and applications. Customers include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Block, Pepperstone and Afterpay. The A$5m seed raise was led by Australasia’s largest venture capital (VC) firm, Blackbird. Factor House said the round was supported by others including Auckland-based angel investor Steven Holmes – who made his investment in a personal capacity but is perhaps best-known in the VC community as the director of rich-lister Murray Bolton’s family office, Bolton Equities. Sorry, I had to ask. Half of my self-selecting sample of my followers on LinkedIn hated the idea of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon replicating Elon Musk’s DOGE rampage in the US with a local tech figure in charge. I would have added recent policy enthusiast Rod Drury, too, but LinkedIn only allows four choices (and doesn’t support embedding, so I had to recreate it above but see the original here). You could say former Telecom and Spark executive Simon Moutter is now in the frame, too, given he was recently made chair of Kāinga Ora (with former Spark “chief turnaround officer” Matt Crockett appointed Kāinga Ora’s chief executive around the same time). Comments ranged from “the constitutional equivalent of arson” to “I don’t think anyone in NZ has the stomach for it” to various proposals to streamline a spending purger with AI. Steven Joyce and Richie McCaw got write-ins. Feel free to leave your take in Comments below (once Comments are open). Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. Drones, rockets, aircraft and ships can all be made in NZ, but will they get support?

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. SCAM ADVERTISEMENTS THAT use artificial intelligence to masquerade as independent shops in Ireland are continuing to run online, despite previous complaints about similar cons. The ads, various versions of which are running on Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, appeal to the consumer’s sympathy, citing financial hardship, break-ins or tragic fires as the reason for the closure of the ‘family-run’ stores. One shop, ‘Walsh Kildare’, has multiple ads running. One claims they are closing down because of a recent fire, while another says they’re closing because of a break-in. The websites the ads link to are only a few months old and people who have purchased from them say the goods are cheap and come from China, not Ireland. It’s a new take on scam ads that have been around for months, where text and images are generated by artificial intelligence, some with more convincing results than others. An ad for 'Walsh Kildare', which claims to be closing down after a break in Some of the ads have obvious AI generated images. This can be identified by dramatic imagery, bad spelling on signs and inconsistent details. Other ads use generic stock photos of shops, people and clothing. An Instagram story for Aidens Kildare that has a 'closure sale' sign spelled incorrectly Instagram Instagram When you search for the shops on Google, no physical store shows up. They also don’t have a physical address on the website. When looking at the Facebook pages that posted the ads, you can see under ‘page transparency’ that they’re not moderated from an Irish location, but rather countries such as the United States and Vietnam. Users can report ads they believe violate Meta’s policies by clicking the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the ad. The scams go against Meta’s rules. It claims it doesn’t “allow advertisers to run ads that promote products, services, schemes or offers that use identified deceptive or misleading practices, including scams to take money from people or access personal information”. Meta declined to comment on the continuous presence of the ads on its platforms. An Instagram ad for 'Byrne Cork'. There is no store with this name in Cork Aidens Kildare is another fake shop that is “closing down”. Its site, aidenskildare.com, was created less than five months ago, according to a domain age checker. Advertisement The quality of the clothing has been described as “dire” on Trustpilot, and several people say they waited months for a refund, or weren’t given one at all. On Trustpilot, where customers can leave reviews of companies, 97% of people gave “Aidan’s Kildare” a 1-star rating (the lowest one can give), with several customers accusing the shop of scamming. “Total scammers!! You will receive junk from China,” they wrote. “They say you can keep item and they’ll give you 30% off next purchase! When you finally get a return address it’s in China and you have to pay to return, and even with tracking, they say they haven’t received it.” Another unhappy customer wrote: ”Avoid this store when you see advert on Facebook or elsewhere!!! Bloody scammers pretending to be an Irish company. “Took 1 month for sub standard jackets to arrive from China. My arms couldn’t even get through the ill- fitted cheap quality clothes.” One customer said Aidan’s Kildare is “false advertising”, as there’s “no such shop in Kildare”. 'Moda Kildare' website, which is four months old Moda Kildare is another shop that operates using the same scamming techniques. Its logo has the colours of the Irish flag underneath it, but customers say it’s not based in Ireland at all. Its website was created only four months ago, and reviews report it selling “cheap crap” at a relatively high price. The fake websites are an example of dropshipping, where a seller accepts orders without keeping stock on hand or having a physical shop. The seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. The Journal previously asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) about what a person should do if they think they have been duped by one of these websites. The commission said that anyone who believes they have been scammed should immediately contact their bank or credit card issuer, who can place their account and card on hold while they investigate the problem. Anyone who has been caught by a scam should contact Gardaí, who have advice about online shopping fraud and how to avoid scams on their website. Coimisiún na Meán, which regulates online platforms in Ireland, also said that when users discover something that they think is illegal or against a platform’s rules, they should report it to the relevant platform. If a person can’t find a way to do this or if they’re unhappy with how the platform has responded to them, they can contact the commission.

While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's ... [+] growth remain robust. As the world’s largest semiconductor company prepares to release its fourth-quarter fiscal 2025 (ending January 31, 2025) results post-market close on February 26, 2025, all eyes are on Nvidia Corporation (NVDA). With a staggering market capitalization of $3.4 trillion, the Santa Clara-based tech giant has become synonymous with the AI revolution, transforming from a gaming-focused GPU maker into a full-stack computing powerhouse reshaping global industries. The upcoming earnings report comes at a crucial time for Nvidia, as investors seek clarity on whether the company can maintain its extraordinary growth trajectory amid emerging competition and evolving market dynamics. This analysis explores what investors should know before this pivotal earnings announcement. The artificial intelligence landscape witnessed significant shifts in early 2025, marked by the emergence of new players and technological breakthroughs. One of the most notable developments has been the rise of the Chinese research lab DeepSeek, which demonstrated the ability to train competitive AI models at a fraction of the traditional computing power requirements, challenging conventional assumptions about AI infrastructure needs. Despite these disruptions, major tech companies have doubled their AI investments. Industry giants like Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) have announced record-breaking capital expenditure plans for 2025, with Meta planning to spend up to $65 billion on AI infrastructure (up from $39.2 billion last year), Alphabet projecting $75 billion in capital expenditures. Amazon potentially exceeds $100 billion in AI-related investments Nvidia’s stock has demonstrated remarkable strength, surging 136.7% over the past 52 weeks and significantly outperforming the S&P 500 Index's 25% gain and the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund's 17.9% return. However, the stock trades approximately 11% below its early January 2025 record high, following concerns about DeepSeek's technological breakthrough. The company's financial performance has been equally impressive, with its most recent quarterly results showcasing the tremendous demand for AI computing solutions. In fiscal Q3 2025, Nvidia reported record Data Center revenue of $30.8 billion, representing a 112% year-over-year increase. Total revenues reached an all-time high of $35.1 billion, up 93.6% from the previous year, while net income grew by 108.9% to $19.3 billion. Current market sentiment remains decisively positive, with 36 out of 43 analysts maintaining "Strong Buy" ratings on the stock. The mean price target of $176.55 suggests a potential 25.4% upside from current levels, reflecting continued optimism about Nvidia’s growth prospects. The primary catalyst driving Nvidia's outlook continues to be the unprecedented demand for AI computing infrastructure. The company's latest Blackwell architecture, particularly the GB200 NVL72 system, offers performance capabilities that are 30 times faster than previous generations for AI inference tasks, positioning Nvidia to maintain its market leadership. The company's dominant position in the data center GPU market, where it captured an astounding 98% market share in 2023, provides a strong foundation for continued growth. The H100 GPU was the hottest AI data center chip globally in 2023, later superseded by the H200 and now by the entirely new generation of GPUs based on Nvidia's Blackwell architecture. CEO Jensen Huang's recent comment about "insane" demand following Blackwell's broad release at the end of 2024 suggests a strong market reception, with sales reportedly meeting high expectations. Major customers' aggressive infrastructure expansion plans further support the outlook for sustained demand growth. Analysts expect NVIDIA to report EPS of $0.79 for the upcoming quarter, reflecting a 61.2% year-over-year increase from last year’s $0.49. The consensus revenue forecast of $38.1 billion exceeds management's guidance of $37.5 billion, signaling market confidence in NVIDIA's ability to outperform expectations. The company has consistently delivered earnings surprises, beating estimates by: Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, analysts project 43.2% year-over-year EPS growth, with earnings expected to reach $3.98 per share, up from $2.77 in fiscal 2025. Longer-term forecasts see EPS climbing to $4.92 in 2027 and $6.26 in 2028, reflecting continued momentum in AI-driven growth. Wall Street focuses on the company's guidance for fiscal 2026's first quarter, with analysts forecasting nearly $42 billion in revenue. If management's guidance tops this number, it could help alleviate concerns about the DeepSeek development's impact on demand. Key factors could significantly influence Nvidia's upcoming earnings report and market reaction. Each element warrants careful consideration as investors position themselves ahead of the announcement. The global semiconductor supply chain remains critical to Nvidia's ability to meet the surging demand for its products. While the company has successfully navigated previous supply constraints, its ability to secure sufficient manufacturing capacity and maintain efficient distribution channels will be crucial for meeting the ambitious growth expectations set by Wall Street. The company's relationships with key manufacturing partners and supply chain management strategies will be particularly important as it ramps production of its new Blackwell-based products while maintaining a supply of existing high-demand components. DeepSeek's recent announcement that it successfully trained competitive AI models for just $5.6 million, using older-generation GPUs, has raised questions about the necessity of cutting-edge hardware for AI development. However, major customer commentary suggests that any training workload reduction could be offset by increasing inference demands, particularly as newer AI models require more computational power for operation. Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that inference workloads are now consuming increasing computing power as newer AI models spend more time "thinking" (test-time scaling). This perspective from one of Nvidia's largest customers helps contextualize the evolving nature of AI infrastructure requirements. While AI and data center applications have dominated recent discussions, Nvidia's gaming business remains significant. The gaming market's health and potential cryptocurrency mining demand could impact overall results. However, these factors have become less important given the overwhelming significance of data center revenue, which accounts for approximately 88% of total revenue. Nvidia's stock presents several compelling opportunities for investors. The company's current valuation metrics, including a P/E ratio of 51.1, represent a 13% discount to its 10-year average P/E ratio 59.2. Based on forward earnings expectations for fiscal 2026 of $4.44 per share, the stock trades at an even more attractive forward P/E of 29.2. This valuation gap suggests significant potential upside, as the stock would need to appreciate by 102% just to trade in line with its historical average P/E ratio, assuming current earnings forecasts prove accurate. Major tech companies' massive capital expenditure commitments suggest sustained strong demand for Nvidia's products through 2025 and beyond. This provides a clear pathway for continued revenue growth and potential market share expansion in the AI infrastructure market. Despite the positive outlook, investors should consider several risk factors. The emergence of efficient training methods demonstrated by DeepSeek could potentially impact demand for high-end GPUs, particularly if similar approaches gain widespread adoption. The stock's high valuation, even at current discounted levels, leaves little room for execution missteps. Any indication of slowing growth or margin pressure could lead to significant price volatility, as evidenced by the 7% decline following the company's Q3 earnings release in November 2024, despite strong results. Competition in the AI chip market is intensifying, with both established players and startups working to develop alternative solutions. While Nvidia's market position remains strong, maintaining its current market share may become increasingly challenging. Bottom Line Nvidia's upcoming earnings report represents a crucial moment for the company and the broader AI industry. While recent developments have introduced some uncertainty, the fundamental drivers of Nvidia's growth remain robust. Strong customer commitments, continuous innovation, and attractive valuation metrics suggest the company is well-positioned to maintain its leadership in AI computing infrastructure. As the February 26 earnings announcement approaches, investors should focus on management's forward guidance and commentary about evolving market dynamics, which will likely provide valuable insights into Nvidia's trajectory for the remainder of 2025 and beyond.

Title: It's common to compare AI developments to the Space Race, but it's far from the same

On July 20, 1969, as Neil Armstrong planted his foot on the Moon, he spoke the famous words “That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” His universal words were an interesting choice given he was on the Moon to establish the dominance of the United States in space and regain the lead in the Space Race after the Soviet Union had a series of early successes such as launching the first satellite - Sputnik, put the first man and woman in space, performed the first space walk, and launched the first probe that impacted the Moon. Today, progress in space is still being made but NASA and SpaceX have a clear lead in the field, and there's not as much national urgency as we saw during the Space Race. The focus has now shifted towards what has been dubbed the AI Race by the media. The main players in this race are the United States and China. It had been assumed that the US had a several year lead on China in AI, by figures like former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Less than a year after that prediction, Chinese firm DeepSeek released its R1 reasoning model that was comparable to o1 from OpenAI. While OpenAI had been hiding o1 behind a paywall, DeepSeek released its reasoning model for free in its app, open sourced most of the code, and made it competitive with o1, but it cost a fraction of the price to train. DeepSeek gripped headlines for days, and it was even mentioned by President Trump. It had the United States spooked. If the AI Race wasn't on before, it certainly is now. In this editorial, I want to criticize the term AI Race. The main basis for my criticism of the term is the fact that many of the AI models that are being released, are being made open source. DeepSeek is the most famous example of an open-source model, and that's from the supposed competitor, China. American companies have already taken the code, removed the censorship Chinese law requires for its companies, and have even monetized it. While the chief American AI firm, OpenAI, is keeping its AI development a secret, Meta has made its Llama AI models open source and communities like Hugging Face are doing their best to make open source models more available and is even developing software to plug gaps, including with its Open Deep Research project. While I think it's true it could be construed as an AI Race with regards to weapons of war, I'm a lot more skeptical about the description being applied in the context of large language models, especially when it involves the significant sharing of the source code of models. In this editorial, I will look in-depth at the competition between the US and the USSR during the Space Race and the competition between the US and China in the AI Race. I will look at how they are different and outline a more constructive framework for understanding what's happening now. The Space Race got underway on July 30, 1955, when the United States declared its intent to put satellites into Earth orbit. This was reciprocated by the Russians four days later who said they would also do the same in the near future. The Space Race came as a direct result of the Cold War where the capitalist West was facing off with the communist East, which had gained ground around the world after overthrowing the Nazis and their allies in Eastern Europe during World War II and as a result of decolonization in the Global South. Building sophisticated rockets and satellites was important for both sides. The rockets could be adapted for nuclear warheads in the case of a hot war and the satellites were useful for intelligence gathering - satellites are still widely used for this today. Feats like getting to the Moon, while less directly useful in the case of war, acted like propaganda for the respective nation's economic system. For the Space Race to finally end, it took the complete collapse of the Soviet Union, after which, Russia collaborated with the US and its allies on space with projects like the International Space Station. Unlike today's AI Race where many players are releasing their source code publicly, the space programs run by the US and the USSR were both secretive and nationalized. Many details about AI advancements can be found in scientific papers too, whereas in the Space Race, there was tighter control over what information was being shared to help each of the countries keep their respective advantages. As a result of the Space Race, both countries developed their own rocket technologies, with the German V-2 rocket as the shared basis. They both developed their own satellites such as Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1, they both developed their own human spaceflight system independently, as well as their space suits and life support systems. This is very different to the AI Race where advancements in the AI space are being shared. We are even being given roundabout information from companies like OpenAI who choose not to open up their source code. The main consequences of developing technologies in silos were slowed scientific advancements, duplicated efforts, and increased geopolitical tensions. The main goals of the Space Race, aside from the military applications of the satellites and rockets, was the ability to show off which country had the best political and economic system. It also acted to give the countries more prestige when they were able to achieve milestones with the technology they had achieved. With the so-called AI Race, America is keen on maintaining its leadership for further economic benefits, and to promote its values of freedom and human rights. One significant issue we saw with DeepSeek was the embedded censorship which stopped the model from criticizing the ruling Communist Party, its leader, or its geopolitical ambitions. Finally, it’s worth pointing out that the two races are different in that the Space Race was primarily driven by the US and Russian governments, rather than private business, with largely military ends. On the other hand, the cutting edge AI tools are being developed by private companies with a focus on productivity and efficiency. It’s true that there are military applications for artificial intelligence, which are dangerous, but primarily, the concern seems to be economic. If the current situation around artificial intelligence was truly a race, we would expect businesses developing this software to hold all their secrets close to their chest, making it harder to catch up, but that is not what we are seeing. While some businesses can be categorized like this with their closed source models, organizations working on open models such as Meta, Mistral AI, DeepSeek, Alibaba, Stability AI, and Hugging Face. Even companies like Google, which have developed closed source models, have released development tools like TensorFlow to advance AI development. This level of openness seems to be a more collaborative phenomenon, rather than a competitive race. Not only are companies releasing their software as open source programs, but their research is also being published in open pre-print publications such as arXiv allowing for the greater levels of collaboration. This further detracts from the idea of an AI Race. The open publication of AI research papers means that companies from different countries are integrating the latest ideas to improve their models. Even in the case of OpenAI, which is closed source, the recent release of DeepSeek R1 impressed Sam Altman who put a special emphasis on noting what R1 delivers for the price. Now that OpenAI knows more efficient methods exist, and has R1’s code, it can make its own models more efficient and available at a lower cost to consumers. The efficient techniques used by R1 also highlights another key difference between AI competition and the Space Race - that is, it’s mainly driven by economic and commercial factors, rather than for military ends or proving if particular countries have a better economic model. Just days after the release of DeepSeek R1 and its unlimited thinking requests, suddenly OpenAI releases o3-mini for free users (it still has a limit), and in recent days, Google released its thinking version of Gemini Flash 2.0 for free users. This type of behavior is common in the AI race; charge an incredible amount of money from premium users until one player makes a new feature, such as reasoning, available for all and then the other players are forced to follow suit. While it’s true that AI does have military applications, these consumer facing generative AI bots are focused on economics - such as making money for the business that makes them and adding productivity for those who consume them. Ultimately, the AI Race narrative is an oversimplification and rather too dramatic. For the most part the development of AI and products that come as a result, are just an example of normal economic competition. In fact, the field has much more collaboration going on compared to other industries. I heard about DeepSeek a couple of days before awareness of it exploded across international news channels. Sure, it wouldn’t talk about the Communist Party of China, its leader, or the country’s territorial disputes, but it would do pretty much everything else. Not only did it scour up to a huge 50 online news sources, but it also used reasoning, in an unlimited quantity, to give me better responses. I could ask it all sorts of things such as for comprehensive stock exit strategies, I could ask it who it thought would win particular horse races, and I could get it to answer all sorts of speculative questions such as what month and year does it think humans will get to Mars. Compared to the offerings at the time from Google and OpenAI, DeepSeek stood head and shoulders above. For free users, DeepSeek was the only company offering unlimited access to the web and reasoning combined. As a result, it climbed to the top of app stores and spooked the US tech industry and investors who thought it spelt the end of the AI bubble. Unlike those inferior models from Google and OpenAI (the ones available to free users), DeepSeek R1 was an open source model. This means that the company divulges most of the inner workings of the model so that others can take and adapt it, as long as they follow any provisions set out in the open source license. While largely open source, some components remained closed including the methodologies for data collection, model training, and scaling laws. Once DeepSeek had become widely known, and name dropped by President Trump, the company started being impacted by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack - the Venom DDoS Community has claimed responsibility for this attack. While DeepSeek was being attacked, Meta started dissecting the code to improve its own Llama models and Perplexity hosted an uncensored version in the US for use on its platform, though it's not unlimited like the one hosted by DeepSeek. The open source AI community, Hugging Face, has also hosted the DeepSeek R1 model on its HuggingChat platform, but this model doesn’t have as comprehensive web access like that found in the DeepSeek app. The best example of DeepSeek’s technology being monetized by American companies is in the case of Perplexity which offers a handful of R1 searches to free users before asking them to upgrade to a premium tier. By monetizing reasoning models, companies like Perplexity can limit access to its compute power so that the service remains fast for all users. This added sustainability also ensures it can continue to grow in the future. Making money and ensuring access to a stable platform is in no way at odds with the open source model, open source just means that people can share their research and tools are potentially developed quicker. Aside from the business benefits and research benefits, open sourcing models can also democratize access to AI technology. AI engineering can be a very lucrative career for anyone willing to put in the time and effort required and by opening up model source code, those who are interested, and learn more about how models are made, potentially opening up careers. It also allows tinkerers to run models on their own hardware for unlimited access and more privacy. If the AI Race was truly a race comparable to the Space Race, China wouldn’t be allowing its models to be open sourced so that American businesses can profit on them and boost America’s economy. For the most part, it is just like any other competition we see countries engaging in. I think it’s also generally a good thing that countries and businesses are being this open as it means we could reach artificial general intelligence and artificial superintelligence much faster. Just look at how the AI we currently have is contributing to fields like healthcare and material science - imagine what will be unlocked when we have AI that surpasses what humans are capable of. We will have lots of new breakthroughs in many fields which will lift up everyone’s living conditions. These more powerful AI systems will also require more power, this will likely see investments in renewable energy and nuclear energy, helping the shift away from fossil fuels. Since the early days of the generative AI era, which kicked off in November 2022 with the arrival of ChatGPT, AI companies have sought to claw back their losses from customers by offering better language models or restricting the number of requests free users can make. To attract customers, companies need to offer the best language models and avoid being overtaken by their competitors. Up to the present, OpenAI has largely been seen as the leader in the space. It has recently released the Operator web browser, which is AI operated and Deep Research. Both products are groundbreaking in terms of functionality. Other companies like Google and Meta are also trying to branch out from chatbots too, Google has developed NotebookLM which lets you upload sources such as reports and then get help from AI to sift through the massive loads of data. Meta has also started expanding its AI tools with the launch of AI-supported document editor. An important consideration for AI is the hardware that it runs on. Nvidia has been a major beneficiary in this respect because its hardware has been what’s powering models like ChatGPT. Sam Altman, head of OpenAI also expressed last year that $7 trillion was needed to overcome hardware limitations affecting AI progress. When DeepSeek R1 came along, claiming to be 27 times cheaper to run than OpenAI’s o1 reasoning model, it sent stocks in the US tumbling because there was a realization that maybe so much compute power wasn’t needed after all and also, just how the hell were AI companies planning to make money if DeepSeek was giving unlimited access to its AI and open sourcing all its code? The release of DeepSeek put pressure on OpenAI to release its new o3-mini reasoning for all users, including those who don’t pay. While Sam Altman publicly says he is excited about the competition, there are also claims that its lead is also narrowing, which could be worrying the company internally. DeepSeek R1’s launch has not been all bad news for the American players though. The popular AI search engine Perplexity was quick to add R1 to its collection of reasoning models as part of its Pro search. Free users get a handful of Pro searches per day, but to unlock more, you have to pay. The inclusion of R1 could have made the subscription more appealing, leading to increased revenues for the company. Perplexity was able to uncensor the model and host it in the US, removing any political bias concerns that exist with the DeepSeek-hosted model. At the time of writing, it’s fair to say that despite the benefits of open source models, they have not managed to surpass the proprietary leaders yet, although, they’re not too far behind. In terms of hosted services, these open source models contribute to a more competitive playing field. They also provide unique benefits such as being able to run them on local hardware, which is good for privacy and having unlimited access in terms of requests. In this editorial, I have tried to dispel the notion that what’s happening in AI today is not an AI Race comparable to the Space Race, but rather, ordinary competition, with a whole lot of collaboration. The frequent publications of AI research papers and the release of open source models like DeepSeek’s R1 stand in contrast to the largely secretive development of rockets and satellites in the Space Race, which the media tries to draw comparisons with. The development of new AI tools is moving quite rapidly with cutting edge features usually hidden behind a paywall until one of the market participants decides to release those features and the other players follow suit. Thanks to the greater sharing of information compared to developments during the Space Race, there is less reproduced effort going on and things are moving along quickly. As mentioned earlier, another difference between the Space Race and the AI competition is that the former was between governments, and the latter by private companies, seeking market share and profits. Going forward, it is unclear what will happen between the closed source AI companies like OpenAI and the open source models. Monetization of AI is an important factor as it can help companies recruit and retain the best talent in the industry, which free open models may struggle to do. According to the OpenAI Careers page, a Software Engineer (Full Stack) can earn between $160,000 and $385,000, plus offers equity. Obviously, companies like Meta and DeepSeek are able to pay these great wages despite having open models, but it does make the task easier when models are being monetized. If a company like DeepSeek with open source models does end up taking over OpenAI, it will likely happen all of a sudden with a new model landing and OpenAI not being able to respond quickly, only time will tell what happens going forward though.

UPDATED 06:33 EST / FEBRUARY 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore.
