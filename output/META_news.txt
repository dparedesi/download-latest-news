Plus: DeepSeek’s Debut Chills Markets, Trump Remakes IRS And Tax Policy In His Image, DEI Wins And Loses, Boeing’s Bad 2024 Continues A Trend Of Losses Monday was one of the worst days the Nasdaq has seen in two years, thanks to a massive tech selloff. Chinese AI model DeepSeek, an apparently self-funded platform that reportedly cost just $5.6 million to train, and which was likely developed with less powerful chips than those behind U.S.-based models from companies including OpenAI, made many U.S. tech investors pause and pull back. DeepSeek, which outperformed some OpenAI models, showed the U.S. that a Chinese tech company could become a frontrunner in the race to develop generative AI platforms, despite extensive restrictions placed on U.S. tech exports by former president Joe Biden to prevent that. Investor and billionaire Marc Andreessen wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model is “AI’s Sputnik moment,” Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava and Richard Nieva wrote. DeepSeek pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3% on Monday, but individual companies saw much deeper losses. Nvidia, which makes the processors that power the U.S.’s AI revolution, saw its stock fall nearly 17% on Monday, setting records by shedding nearly $589 billion in the company’s market value. In a statement, Nvidia called DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that actually does use “significant numbers” of Nvidia’s GPUs, but they’re less powerful ones made for use in China that are “fully export control compliant.” Nvidia wasn’t the only company to see a big loss on Monday driven by DeepSeek. Chipmakers Broadcom saw a 17% one-day drop, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose stock fell 13%, were also hurt by the news. The markets slowly began recovering Tuesday, but increases were more gradual. There’s long been speculation that AI companies were becoming overvalued. Nvidia rocketed from a company that made graphics cards for video games to the leading player in AI hardware—and now with eyes on self-driving cars, robotics and smart warehouses—in a matter of years, and has at times been the world’s most valuable company. While Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Apple have several other services, company progress on AI has played an outsized role as in how their shares have performed. And private companies including OpenAI—valued at $157 billion—and Anthropic—worth $6 billion after a pending $2 billion funding round is finalized—are pulling in dollars and influence. According to Crunchbase, close to a third of all global venture funding in 2024 went to companies in AI-related fields, totaling more than $100 billion. Is this the beginning of the burst of the AI bubble? It could be. Before DeepSeek impacted U.S. markets, Forbes contributor Abdo Riani compared AI to the tech bubble a generation ago, when early dot-com companies quickly went from ballooning fortunes to struggling to keep the lights on. The dot-com bubble was fueled by investor over-optimism in the power of the internet, overlooking rational considerations of what the technology could do and deliver. The companies that survived the bubble’s burst, including Amazon, Google and eBay, Riani wrote, used the technology to bring specific values and usage to the technology. The stock market leader of two years from now may be a company that can use AI to make a difference through AI-powered agents, or mostly autonomous robots and vehicles. But maybe it will still be Nvidia, which will continue creating the hardware for AI, and has a good track record of recovering from drastic swings in its value. The CFO’s role in a company is always evolving. I talked to Megan Weis, vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, and host of a weekly CFO podcast, about the changes she’s seeing in the job. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump speaks at a White House news conference last week. Taxes are important to Donald Trump, and he’s pressing forward with remaking the IRS in his policy likeness. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel officially left the department on January 20, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, clearing a path for Trump nominee Billy Long to take over. IRS commissioners serve five-year terms and are generally not replaced as administrations change. Werfel’s term wasn’t up until late 2027. No confirmation hearings appear to be scheduled for Long, a former congressman and Trump loyalist with no direct background in tax policy. Among his day one executive orders, Trump put a 90-day federal hiring freeze in place throughout the government so the new Department of Government Efficiency could figure out the correct size of the government workforce. However, the IRS hiring freeze seems more permanent, and will remain in place until the Treasury secretary determines it’s in the national interest to lift it, Phillips Erb writes. Biden boosted the IRS’s personnel funding in order to provide better and faster service to taxpayers, as well as to pursue high-wealth individuals, large corporations and complex partnerships to ensure they are paying their fair share. In November and December 2023, the IRS offered positions to more than 560 new accountants. This week, Phillips Erb writes, job offers have been rescinded to job candidates with start dates after February 8. Trump has also talked about firing existing IRS employees, aiming at the 87,000 new IRS workers—for positions ranging from customer service and IT to enforcement—that would be hired over the next decade through 2023’s Inflation Reduction Act. “They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,” he told a crowd last week at the Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Phillips Erb reported. While Trump passed large tax cuts in his first term and has said extending—or even increasing—them is a priority in his second, Republicans in Congress are hashing out the best way to do that. Trump has said he wants everything in one bill so it’s easier to get everything that is wanted. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, so the leadership to enact those cuts is now in place. As far as international taxes, Trump also issued a memo saying that any commitment made under the Biden administration to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to the Global Tax Deal will not be followed. The OECD determines how international corporations are taxed by all countries, and Trump’s memo says that Congress will work toward a more America first tax policy, Phillips Erb writes. A Costco store in Richmond, California. As some companies rein in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts—last week, Target joined the list of companies scaling back policies to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women—others are doubling down on them. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. However, business DEI policies may be thrust in an uncomfortable spotlight by Trump, who opposes the policy. He signed a day one executive order ending federal DEI programs, saying that the “illegal and immoral” plans “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” Another executive order brings this crackdown to the private sector by rescinding a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Trump is now requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days. The fuselage and one of the engines of a Boeing 777-9 jetliner aircraft on the tarmac at Dubai World Central - Al-Maktoum International Airport. With a shocking in-flight plane malfunction, a rejected plea deal for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and a seven-week machinists strike halting production, Boeing had a terrible 2024—posting a stunning $11.8 billion loss. But, Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky writes, that’s actually part of a pattern for Boeing. The aircraft company is on a six-year losing streak, and is likely to have lost a total of $35.7 billion in that time period. Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that activist investors—including investment titan Warren Buffett—may be looking closely at Boeing as a potential target. Personiv Vice President and General Manager of Finance & Accounting Outsourcing Services Megan Weis. As vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, Megan Weis has her finger on the pulse of how the CFO’s profession is changing. She also talks with different CFOs about their work in her CFO Weekly podcast. I talked to her about the CFO’s evolution in 2025. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you see the CFO’s role continuing to evolve in 2025? Weis: I can’t have a conversation these days without hearing about generative AI. It’s still pretty nascent. Most smaller to mid-size companies are experimenting with some things here and there at the moment, whereas enterprise companies are using it to turn data into actionable insights. Technology is going to continue to evolve. Cybersecurity is becoming a huge issue these days, and CFOs are becoming more and more responsible for managing that risk. Hackers are becoming more clever, and the risks are just becoming more and more. Globally, it’s becoming very unstable. We have supply chain issues, there are currency fluctuations, inflationary concerns. It’s becoming more complex. Soft skills are becoming and more and more of a requirement. The CFO role is like a ringleader; it’s very collaborative. The CFO is becoming more responsible for communicating across the organization, and that ties back to the idea of being the storyteller. With so much data out there, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to digest that data, turn it into actionable insights, and be able to communicate it back to the organization in a way that finance or non-finance and accounting people can understand, whether that be employees or investors. How did the evolution to CFO-as-storyteller begin, and what stories can the CFO tell that a company would miss otherwise? It started when the CFO role started gearing toward being more of a strategic role, or a right hand to the CEO. The CFO is becoming more responsible for bridging the gap between finance and other departments. They’re responsible for collaborating. A lot of them throughout their career are stepping out of finance for a time and concentrating more in operational areas. [It’s important] being able to communicate to investors [and] employees, and really humanizing financial data. At this point, there’s just so much data that's available to finance and accounting and the CFO that you really have to take that data, boil it down, digest it, tell a story with it, and then align that story with the culture and the objectives of the organization. In general, the world is looking for more transparency. They’re looking for organizations who stand for something, and that’s part of where the storytelling comes in. People want to work for organizations that are purpose-driven and where the stories align, whether that be the stories they’re trying to sell to investors or the story that their financial data is telling. Transparency is becoming more and more critical. Historically, CFOs have been more of a news reporter. They’ve taken historical data and regurgitated it back to investors and companies, whereas today, they’re more forward-looking, more strategic. They still have to get the numbers, but they’re helping to shape the story more than just report the news. How do fractional CFOs work, and how often are they being used? Fractional CFOs are something that I hadn’t really heard about before I’d started this podcast. I do think that they are becoming more prevalent. They’ve grown over the last decade or so, and they’re being used a lot for small and mid-size businesses who can’t afford a full-time CFO, but still need the guidance of someone with experience being a CFO. The fractional CFO plays really well into the gig economy: People wanting a portfolio of work, and maybe not just relying on one employee to be their employee for their entire career. That’s not the way things work anymore. An employe[r] might not hold on to you for your entire career. Building a portfolio of clients for CFOs is the route that they want to go. Also, with more PE-backed companies, those PE firms are looking for CFOs, and someone with the experience of a CFO to help make strategic decisions for those organizations, help guide them through growth periods. I also think fractional CFOs play a big part in a company being able to be agile and pull in experts when those experts are needed. Every company goes through different stages, whether that be growth or crisis, and I think the fractional CFO allows those small companies to be agile and pull in the right talent when it’s needed. Unionized employees at Costco voted to go on strike when their contract expires on January 31. The company has rejected union proposals for increased seniority pay, paid family leave, bereavement policies, sick time and safeguards against surveillance. 18,000: Number of Costco employees represented by the Teamsters union—about 8% of the warehouse retailer’s full workforce 26%: Costco’s profit growth since the current union contract, signed in 2022 ‘Costco claims to treat workers better than the competition, but right now, it’s failing to live up to that reputation’: Tom Erickson, director of the Teamsters Warehouse Division, said in a statement To be a leader that employees, colleagues and investors trust, it’s important to be authentic.

Title: Microsoft to report Q2 earnings as DeepSeek raises AI spending questions

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Microsoft (MSFT) will report its second quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday as Wall Street continues to digest the fallout surrounding DeepSeek’s impact on the AI industry and Silicon Valley’s tech titans. Microsoft and its Big Tech cohort are investing tens of billions of dollars in the data centers and infrastructure needed to train and deploy AI software across their various services. But China’s DeepSeek upended the general thinking that developing AI models requires the use of the most powerful, and expensive, chips with the release of its R1 model on Jan. 20. The model, the company claims, was trained on systems that were less powerful and less expensive than those produced by American rivals like Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META). The company’s app shot to the top of the App Store over the weekend, driving a huge amount of interest in the relatively small firm and clobbering American AI stocks, including AI bellwether Nvidia. Now Microsoft will have to prove not only that its own AI work is paying off in terms of increased revenue but also that its hefty infrastructure investments are truly necessary. For the quarter, Microsoft is expected to report earnings per share (EPS) of $3.13 on revenue of $68.8 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported EPS of $2.93 on revenue of $62 billion in the same quarter last year. Importantly, Microsoft’s Commercial Cloud segment revenue, which includes cloud services sales, is expected to come in at $41.1 billion. That would be an increase from the $31.9 billion the company reported in Q2 last year. Its intelligent cloud business, which includes its Azure platform, is set to come in at $25.8 billion, up from $21.5 billion. In a note to investors, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said he believes Azure growth will begin to reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. “Our checks continue to indicate improving consumption/core cloud trends,” he wrote. “Also, [Microsoft] just announced that ‘OpenAI recently made a new, large Azure commitment that will continue to support all OpenAI products as well as training.’ ” While Microsoft is one of the main beneficiaries of the AI boom, its stock price has lagged behind the competition. Shares of Microsoft were up just 5% over the last 12 months as of Monday, while Amazon (AMZN) and Google shares were up 44% and 26%, respectively. Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne, however, says the stock could be set up for a “mini revenge trade” as AI sales increase, its Copilot adoption rate improves, and capital expenditure moderates, creating more free cash flow. Microsoft is also seeking to jump-start PC sales via its Copilot+ PC lineup. The idea is that AI PCs will be able to run AI applications natively rather than via the cloud. But so far, there aren’t very many intriguing scenarios in which those applications make upgrading worthwhile. Hardware updates like improved performance and power are still the main reason consumers want new PCs. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Why Everyone Is Freaking Out About DeepSeek, China’s Answer to ChatGPT
URL: http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/deepseek-china-chatgpt-ai-1235248182/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T16:27:57Z

By Miles Klee Years of feverish hype around artificial intelligence technology have convinced many that it’s Silicon Valley‘s next speculative bubble — and prompted questions of how long giants like OpenAI can keep burning through billions of dollars in their quest for a true breakthrough AI. Now, a Chinese company has unveiled a cutting-edge AI model that it says it developed in under two months, with end-stage training costs of less than $6 million, figures that significantly undercut the levels of investment from U.S. firms in bots such as ChatGPT and the infrastructure to run them. And the market may never be the same. DeepSeek — the name of both the lab and its model — emerged as a side project of Liang Wenfeng, co-founder of the hedge fund High-Flyer, who began importing processing chips from Nvidia in 2021 for the project. (The California-based manufacturer is a major supplier of the high-performance graphic processing units, or GPUs, hardware that provides the tremendous computing power necessary to train and run AI.) In 2023, High-Flyer launched a version of DeepSeek as an internal tool to help identify and predict market trends to improve its trading decisions. But last week, the company released an “AI assistant” bot, DeepSeek-V3, a large language model that has since become the most-downloaded free app on Apple devices (ahead of OpenAI’s ChatGPT), and a reasoning model, DeepSeek-R1, that it claims hits the same benchmarks as OpenAI’s comparable model. The lab has also debuted a multimodal model capable of generating images that appears to outperform competitors DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion. These various upstarts alone might have sent ripples through venture capital firms and major tech players that have bet billions on AI, including Microsoft, Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia. What really shook these investors on Monday, however, was the efficiency touted by DeepSeek: it reportedly uses a limited number of reduced-capacity chips from Nvidia, in turn substantially lowering operating costs and the price of premium models for consumers. By contrast, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged just weeks ago that the company loses money even on pro subscriptions that cost $200 a month, thanks to the astronomical cost of the processing power their software requires. With an alleged price tag of around $5.5 million for its final phase of development, DeepSeek-V3 also represents a relatively cheap alternative to models that have cost tens of millions to engineer. On top of all that, DeepSeek’s codes are actually open-source, freely available for users to distribute and modify, or run on a private device without giving away personal data. U.S. firms, meanwhile, tend to keep the inner workings of their AIs cloaked in as much secrecy as possible. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The upshot of all this was a sudden loss of faith in industry leaders, including several who are collaborating on a $500 billion project to expand AI infrastructure under President Trump, known as the Stargate Initiative. The chipmaker Nvidia was hardest hit, losing $600 billion in market capitalization as its share price plummeted 17 percent — the largest single-day drop for a U.S. corporation in history. This sell-off indicated a sense that the next wave of AI models may not require the tens of thousands of top-end GPUs that Silicon Valley behemoths have amassed into computing superclusters for the purposes of accelerating their AI innovation. Sharply reduced demand for chips and massive data centers like those Trump has proposed under Stargate (in an announcement that propelled AI stocks higher just days ago) could entirely reshape this sector of the economy. By Monday’s market close, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 stock market index had shed an incredible $1 trillion from its value on Friday. Of course, DeepSeek’s big splash also made it a target, and the company limited registration on Monday during what it called “large-scale malicious attacks” on its services (though without limiting access to existing users). At the same time, certain analysts argued that the market panic about the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in the AI race could be an overreaction. After all, DeepSeek may point the way for increased efficiency in American-made models, some investors will buy in during this dip, and, as a Chinese company, DeepSeek faces some of the same national security concerns that have bedeviled ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok.

To some observers, it will start to appear that such spending is not only unsustainable but ultimately wasteful, considering how much a foreign startup has accomplished with far less.

Title: China's DeepSeek chatbot reportedly gets much more done with fewer GPUs but Nvidia still thinks it's 'excellent' news

Nvidia claims more AI from fewer chips is good for business. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. China's new DeepSeek R1 language model has been shaking things up by reportedly matching or even beating the performance of established rivals including OpenAI while using far fewer GPUs. Nvidia's response? R1 is "excellent" news that proves the need for even more of its AI-accelerating chips. If you're thinking the math doesn't immediately add up, the stock market agrees, what with $600 billion being wiped off Nvidia's share price this week. So, let's consider a few facts for a moment. Reuters reports that DeepSeek's development entailed 2,000 of Nvidia's H800 GPUs and a training budget of just $6 million, while CNBC claims that R1 "outperforms" the best LLMs from the likes of OpenAI and others. The H800 is a special variant of Nvidia's Hopper H100 GPU that's been hobbled to fit within the US's export restriction rules for AI chips. Some in the AI industry claim that China generally and DeepSeek, in particular, have managed to dodge the export rules and acquire large numbers of Nvidia's more powerful H100 GPUs, but Nvidia has denied that claim. Meanwhile, it's thought OpenAI used 25,000 of Nvidia's previous-gen A100 chips to train ChatGPT 4. It's hard to compare the A100 to the H800 directly, but it certainly seems like DeepSeek got more done with fewer GPUs. That's why the market got the yips when it comes to Nvidia. Maybe we don't need quite as many chips for the AI revolution as was once thought? Needless to say, Nvidia doesn't see it that way, lauding R1 for demonstrating how the so-called "Test Time" scaling technique can help create more powerful AI models. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” the company told CNBC. "DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Of course, all may not be quite as it seems. As Andy reported yesterday, some observers think DeepSeek is actually spending more like $500 million to $1 billion a year. But the general consensus is that DeepSeek is getting more done for much less investment than the established players. Microsoft, for instance, expects to spend $80 billion on AI hardware this year, with Meta saying it will unload $60 to $65 billion. DeepSeek's R1 model seems to imply that similar results can be achieved for an order of magnitude less investment. Best CPU for gaming: The top chips from Intel and AMD.Best gaming motherboard: The right boards.Best graphics card: Your perfect pixel-pusher awaits.Best SSD for gaming: Get into the game ahead of the rest. The question is, does that automatically mean fewer GPUs being bought? Perhaps not. At the kind of investment levels demonstrated by the likes of Microsoft and Meta, the number of organisations that can get involved is necessarily limited. It's just too expensive. Cut that by a tenth or more and suddenly the number of potential participants might explode. And they'll all want GPUs. It's a little like the move from mainframe to personal computing. Sure, each individual investment in computing was a lot smaller, but the computing business overall grew far larger. So, maybe DeepSeek is an inflection point. From here on, AI development is more accessible, less dominated by a small number of hugely wealthy entities, and maybe even a bit more democratic. Or maybe we'll find out that DeepSeek has used a mountain of H100s after all. Either way, Nvidia will be planning to make its own mountain—of cash. Jeremy has been writing about technology and PCs since the 90nm Netburst era (Google it!) and enjoys nothing more than a serious dissertation on the finer points of monitor input lag and overshoot followed by a forensic examination of advanced lithography. Or maybe he just likes machines that go “ping!” He also has a thing for tennis and cars. FSR 4 may be a simple upgrade for FSR 3.1 games according to leaks, which hopefully means we won't see a repeat of FSR 3's poorly-supported launch MSI says that the supply of its RTX 5090 cards will be very tight, due to a limited supply of GPUs from Nvidia NZXT Capsule Elite review PC Gamer is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Title: Zuckerberg Convening Huge "War Rooms" to Figure Out How a Chinese Startup Is Annihilating Meta's AI
URL: https://futurism.com/zuckerberg-war-rooms-meta-ai-deepseek
Time Published: 2025-01-28T16:14:41Z
Full Content:
Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scrambling after a small Chinese startup called DeepSeek turned Silicon Valley upside down with its chatbot app. The company's latest R1 AI model can run circles around the competition from Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic — and at a tiny fraction of the cost. Despite some skepticism over DeepSeek's claims, the debut has led to some serious soul-searching among AI investors, with the ChatGPT competitor wiping out an estimated $1 trillion in value among other AI companies on Monday. In the most extreme example, AI chipmaker Nvidia set a new record for the biggest single-day loss of any company in history. Among others, the app appears to have caught Meta with its pants down. In response, the company assembled several"war rooms" of engineers, The Information reports, in a desperate attempt to get ahead of the situation. The war rooms are now hard at work, analyzing DeepSeek and looking for possible changes to make to Meta's flagship AI, Llama. And according to the report, engineers are already afraid that the next version of the AI won't be able to compete with the Chinese AI — early indications that this week's chaos might represent the new status quo, rather than a momentary blip as investors find their new footing. "The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?' when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this," one Meta employee told the Financial Times. After trading resumed on Tuesday, Nvidia's share price ricocheted around a bit, but fell far short of recovery. Meanwhile, Meta's stock has largely been unaffected and is up just over seven percent over the last five days, with investors arguing that DeepSeek could bring positive changes to the platform's AI efforts. A notable quality that Llama and DeepSeek share is that they're both open-source, which means developers have unfettered access to the underlying code. But Llama has historically struggled to keep up with the offerings from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic. Now that DeepSeek has thrown the gauntlet in front of the latter two, it'll be interesting to see if Meta can pull ahead. Over the weekend, Zuckerberg committed a whopping $60 billion to AI-related capital expenditures this year alone. In short, the company is all in, intensifying its efforts to keep up with the soaring competition. The war rooms are looking to combine several AI models into one more fully featured system, much like DeepSeek. But whether its efforts will pay off — lowering computing costs for Llama while simultaneously making it more useful — is anyone's guess. Remember when Zuckerberg was all in on the metaverse?

Manage your account For the second time in the last month, a Chinese app has skyrocketed to the top spot in Apple’s App Store. The first was Xiaohongshu, or RedNote, which saw a sudden surge in downloads by United States users seeking an alternative to TikTok in anticipation of the ban on that app, which had been scheduled to take effect on Jan. 19. Now it’s DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company that released a new chatbot model called R1 on Jan. 20. The DeepSeek app has since climbed to the top of the Apple App charts, recording more than 1.6 million downloads since it launched on Jan. 10, according to the market tracker App Figures. DeepSeek announced Monday that it is temporarily restricting new users from signing up for its services, citing “large-scale malicious attacks.” But prior to that, the Chinese startup and its new chatbot seemed on track to surpass the popularity of U.S.-based AI companies such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Meta’s Llama and Google’s Gemini. At a House Republican retreat in Miami on Monday, Trump called the initial success of DeepSeek’s R1 model “very much a positive development” because “instead of spending billions and billions, you’ll spend less, and you’ll come up with, hopefully, the same solution.” He then added it should also be seen as a “wake-up call” for U.S.-based tech companies to develop “a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Here’s what to know. DeepSeek was founded in May 2023, by leaders at the Chinese hedge fund, High-Flyer. The company launched its first AI model chatbot, R1, on Jan. 20. In posts on X, fans of R1 have praised the chatbot’s responses as “human-like” and quick, praising the fact that the app is available for free and that users need not have coding experience to understand how to operate it. In addition to its sudden popularity on the App Store, DeepSeek has attracted attention for its relatively small staff and budget, as compared with the sums American companies have spent on AI development. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal over the weekend, DeepSeek launched R1 with a team of less than 200 people and only spent $5.6 million to train its AI models. By comparison, last week, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his social media conglomerate would invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in AI development this year. In 2024, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said the tech industry would need to spend “trillions” on the computer chips used to power AI. Altman called DeepSeek’s R1 “an impressive model” especially “for the price” in a post on X. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” he wrote. Like other Chinese platforms, there are signs of censorship on DeepSeek on certain topics that are considered sensitive in China, such as questions about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or China's President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek’s success appears to challenge the idea that the U.S. has control of the AI industry. Concerns about this potential threat to U.S. dominance in the field seemed to be reflected on Wall Street Monday, with stocks falling for massive tech giants like Nvidia, Meta and Google’s parent company, Alphabet. In particular, the company’s claim that it built its AI model at a much lower cost compared to other, similar AI platforms seems to be causing panic in the stock market. Yahoo Finance reported that Nvidia, one of the most valuable tech companies in the world, and which builds computer chips for AI, lost a record $589 billion in market capitalization yesterday. The net worth of Nvidia’s CEO and biggest shareholder, Jensen Huang, fell $20.8 billion.

A week before leaving office, Biden’s administration proposed a new framework for restricting U.S. exports of AI computer chips, to prevent countries like China from accessing the advanced technology. “If it’s China and not the United States determining the future of AI on the planet, I think that the stakes of that are just profound," former White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said at the time. At the House Republican retreat this week, Trump said he hoped DeepSeek’s success would remind U.S. tech companies that “we need to be laser-focused on competing.” Trump has signed an executive order on AI to repeal any government policies that “act as barriers to American AI innovation” and, on Jan. 21, announced that his administration was closely working with the Oracle Corporation, OpenAI and SoftBank on his $500 billion AI venture, “Stargate.” At her first press briefing on Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the National Security Council is "looking into" any potential security concerns related to DeepSeek. Leavitt said that while Trump feels confident that "we'll restore American dominance" in the AI field, DeepSeek's success is because the Biden administration "sat on its hands and allowed China to rapidly develop this AI program." (DeepSeek had obtained some of its advanced chips for AI programming before former President Joe Biden's executive order restricting AI chip exports to Chinese tech companies went into effect.)

Title: China heralds DeepSeek as a symbol of AI advancements amid U.S. restrictions

LIVE: Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s Senate confirmation hearing Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time HONG KONG — An artificial intelligence lab in China has become the latest front in the U.S.-China rivalry, raising doubts as to how much — and for how much longer — the United States is in the lead in developing the strategically key technology. The Chinese startup DeepSeek has made waves after releasing AI models that experts say match or outperform leading American models at a fraction of the cost. The meteoric rise of the previously little-known company spooked U.S. investors Monday, wiping out almost $600 billion in the market value of American chipmaker Nvidia in the biggest drop in the nation's market history. In China, DeepSeek is being heralded as a symbol of the country’s AI advancements in the face of U.S. export restrictions that Beijing says are aimed at suppressing its technological development. “This jaw-dropping breakthrough has come from a purely Chinese company,” said Feng Ji, founder and chief executive of Game Science, the developer behind the hit video game Black Myth: Wukong. “DeepSeek may be a national-level technological and scientific achievement,” he wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Zhou Hongyi, co-founder of the Chinese cybersecurity firm Qihoo 360, said China would “undoubtedly come out on top” in the U.S.-China AI race. “If we are to counter America’s AI tech dominance, DeepSeek will definitely be a key member of China’s ‘Avengers team,’” he said in a video on Weibo. So how did a little-known startup become a global AI sensation? Based in the Chinese tech hub of Hangzhou, DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who is also the founder of a hedge fund called High-Flyer that uses AI-driven trading strategies. Liang has said High-Flyer was one of DeepSeek’s investors, though it’s unclear how much it contributed, as well as a source of some of its first employees. “Our core technical roles are mostly filled by fresh graduates or those with just a year or two of work experience,” he told the Chinese media outlet 36Kr in May 2023, adding that the company was looking for “down-to-earth individuals with curiosity.” By 2022, High-Flyer had acquired 10,000 of Nvidia’s high-performance A100 graphics processor chips, according to a post that July on the Chinese social media platform WeChat. The U.S. imposed restrictions on sales of those chips to China later that year. Liang told 36Kr that he acquired the chips mostly because of “curiosity about the boundaries of AI capabilities” and that he had no particular commercial goal in mind. The stock market rout took place a week after DeepSeek’s Jan. 20 release of an open-source language model called R1, which met with widespread acclaim in what venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called “AI’s Sputnik moment.” Investors and the U.S. tech industry were further unnerved later in the week when DeepSeek published a technical report that said the model took only two months and less than $6 million to build, compared with the billions spent by leading U.S. tech companies. The comparatively small spend by DeepSeek showed "a lot of optimization and smart, capable engineering that can be implemented and deployed to keep up in this race," Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in artificial intelligence technologies, told NBC News. The surge in interest sent DeepSeek’s recently released app to the top of Apple’s App Store on Monday. The company later said that it was temporarily limiting user registrations “due to large-scale malicious attacks” on its services, CNBC reported. New users were quick to note that R1 appeared subject to censorship around topics deemed sensitive in China, avoiding answering questions about the self-ruled democratic island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of its territory, or the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown or echoing Chinese government language. The model appears to operate without such restrictions, however, if it is used not through the DeepSeek website but on servers that host it outside mainland China. DeepSeek did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The R1 model is now second only to California-based OpenAI’s o1 in the artificial analysis quality index, an independent AI analysis ranking. It also beats leading models by Google, Meta and the California-based Anthropic. Liang, who according to the China's media is about 40, has kept a relatively low profile in the country, where there has been a crackdown on the tech industry in recent years amid concerns by the ruling Chinese Communist Party that its biggest companies and executives might be getting too powerful. But he appeared on state television last week during a high-profile meeting with Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, who invited Liang and other experts from technology, education, science and other fields to share their opinions for a draft government work report. At the meeting, Li called for “technological innovation” to foster the economy, according to state media reports. China has made AI a national priority, with the goal of becoming the global leader in its technology by 2030. The U.S., concerned about the potential military applications, has moved to limit China's access to American technology, including new restrictions on AI chips issued by Joe Biden in the final days of his presidency. President Donald Trump said Monday that DeepSeek’s rise “should be a wake-up call” for U.S. tech companies. The Chinese Foreign Ministry referred a request for comment Tuesday to the relevant department. R1 has also drawn attention because, unlike OpenAI’s o1, it is free to use and open-source, meaning anyone can study and copy how it was made. Most Chinese engineers are eager for their open-source projects to be used by foreign companies, especially those in Silicon Valley, in part because “no one in the West respects what they do because everything in China is stolen or created by cheating,” said Kevin Xu, the U.S.-based founder of Interconnected Capital, a hedge fund that invests in AI. “They are also aware that Chinese firms have been taking for free lots of open-source tech to advance,” Xu, the former senior director for global expansion at GitHub, said Monday in a post on X, “but they want to create their own, contribute, and prove that their tech is good enough to be taken for free by foreign firms — some nationalism, some engineering pride.” DeepSeek is not the only Chinese AI startup that says it can train models for a fraction of the price. Kai-Fu Lee, founder of 01.AI, has said that it cost $3 million to train its model and that U.S. restrictions on chip exports forced his company to innovate. “The Chinese companies are able to watch the innovations, make some themselves and then do better engineering,” Lee, a former president of Google China, said at a conference in Saudi Arabia in October. “When you do excellent, detailed engineering, it is not the case you have to spend a billion dollars to train a great model.” Mithil Aggarwal is a Hong Kong-based reporter/producer for NBC News.

Title: Why Verizon is excited about AI Connect

Jan 28, 2025 While US tech giants suffered unprecedented share price carnage on Monday, with investors spooked by China’s generative AI (GenAI) newcomer Deepseek, Verizon, which only days earlier launched its AI Connect strategy saw its share price rise unobtrusively by a modest 3% to $40.68. True, the uplift appears to be mainly because the US telco posted a decent set of fourth-quarter results, fuelled by strong wireless subscriber growth, but investors may well have also been reassured that AI Connect, which is aimed at supporting growing demand for AI workloads deployed at scale, largely involves “re-imagining” existing datacentre assets and fibre infrastructure rather than relying on massive capex splurges on spanking new infrastructure. AI Connect will inevitably need some extra investment, but Kyle Malady, CEO of Verizon Business, when fielding questions from financial analysts on Verizon’s Q4 earnings conference call (as transcribed by Motley Fool), seemed to indicate that the money already spent (“to tweak assets”) and future capital requirements would not be significant, at least in the wider capex scheme of things. “[For] some of these [AI workload] deals, what we’ll have to do is spend some capital to edge out our fibre a little bit to go meet people at the right datacentres and/or locations of business and then [retrofit] technical space,” he said. “So, we have money in that, but we’re ready to go with that. It’s all included in the [capex] envelope.” If Malady was coy about AI Connect’s capex requirements, his AI bashfulness disappeared when talking about potential financial opportunities. “Our best guess at the moment is the TAM [total addressable market] we can sell into… what we have is probably $40bn-plus, but you see that every single day, there are new announcements of hundreds of billions of dollars going into this ecosystem,” gushed Malady. “We have a lot of assets that can play right into this. And frankly, we have well over $1bn-plus in funnel right now, and that's really only with our services that we have today.” Google and Meta, noted Malady, have already purchased capacity on Verizon’s network with the intent of using it for their AI workloads. “We are working closely with industry players like Nvidia to reimagine how telco functions can work along with AI workloads. We are starting this development at the far edge in a private network,” he continued. AI inferencing at the edge Looking to the future, Verizon has high hopes that demand will soar for AI inferencing at the network edge, which holds out the promise of reduced latency, real-time decision-making and bandwidth optimisation, and marks a seismic shift away from the current AI focus on training large language modules in large datacentre facilities. Verizon cites consultancy McKinsey, which reckons 60% to 70% of AI workloads are expected to migrate to real-time inference by 2030, “creating an urgent need for low-latency connectivity, compute and security at the edge beyond current demand.” Malady noted: “As AI shifts from training to deep deployment, the need for distributed computing will become increasingly important for real-time decisions and predictions.” Warming to his edge AI compute theme, he added: “We have thousands of distributed telco facilities, many of which already have power, space and cooling available for this compute at the edge. As we take stock of our existing assets, Verizon’s ability to be a foundational player in the AI ecosystem is clear. The technical infrastructure required to enable AI is evolving.” Malady flagged, too, that Verizon has between 100 and 200 acres of undeveloped land, “some currently zoned for datacentre build, and much of it in prime datacentre-friendly areas”. Through a new strategic partnership with Vultr, a GPU-as-a-service (GPUaaS) provider, Verizon will initially deploy GPUaaS infrastructure in one of its datacentres and tap into its high-capacity fibre network for distribution. “We anticipate helping to broaden their reach and enable our mutual customers with AI training and inference capabilities at the edge over time,” stated Verizon. Earlier this month, SK Telecom, arguably the world’s most advanced telco when it comes to AI adoption, launched a GPUaaS offering targeted at enterprise and government customers in South Korea from its AI datacentre in Gasan, on the outskirts of Seoul. Expect to see further announcements from telcos around the world this year about new revenue-generating opportunities linked to the AI boom. - Ken Wieland, Contributing Editor, TelecomTV Jan 29, 2025 Jan 28, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 27, 2025 Jan 24, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. DeepSeek, the latest alternative to ChatGPT and other AI assistants, recently released a new version that’s causing chaos and confusion across the AI landscape. With reports about DeepSeek’s outstanding performance and power efficiency emerging, established entities like OpenAI and Meta are getting quite nervous. None more nervous than Nvidia, though, whose market cap plummeted in response to the hype over DeepSeek. According to Bloomberg, Nvidia lost a record $569 billion at the start of the week. Companies like Siemens Energy and Oracle also saw their stock prices fall. DeepSeek is an AI tool that’s currently available free of charge on the web. You can check it out yourself at chat.deepseek.com, although registration is temporarily on hold due to the recent surge in interest. Not only was DeepSeek developed by a Chinese startup in just a few months, it apparently uses significantly fewer resources. Although it’s reminiscent of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, it’s based on its own large language model called — you guessed it — “DeepSeek,” now version 3. According to some initial impressions, DeepSeek outperforms the competition for many features, including the generation of textual answers and the prompt-based creation of images. The latter is possible with an additional app called Janus Pro. DeepSeek delivers results quickly, and those results are both detailed and coherent. DeepSeek is currently so popular that it’s the most downloaded app in Apple’s App Store (ahead of ChatGPT) and the highest app in the “Top Free Apps” category in the Google Play Store (ahead of ChatGPT, Threads, and Google Gemini). This puts enormous pressure on OpenAI and the rest, who now see their positions jeopardized. Shortly after the publicized success of DeepSeek, the new AI chatbot faced a bitter setback. There’s apparently been a “large-scale cyber attack” on the company, reports BleepingComputer. As a result, new user registrations are not being accepted at this time. However, anyone who already has access to DeepSeek can continue to use it. It’s currently unknown who carried out the attack on DeepSeek, but it’s likely to be a targeted DDoS attack, perhaps perpetrated by an entity who feels threatened by DeepSeek’s sudden catching of attention. We don’t know when DeepSeek user registrations will open again.

Title: Why Dell Technologies Stock Is Down 9% In A Day?

POLAND - 2025/01/11: In this photo illustration, a Dell logo seen displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Mateusz Slodkowski/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE: DELL) suffered a 9% stock drop on Monday, January 27, amid concerns sparked by DeepSeek’s affordable AI chatbot. This emerging technology has disrupted the industry, posing a significant threat to U.S. tech leaders and raising questions about the long-term viability of AI infrastructure investments. Nvidia’s stock(NASDAQ: NVDA) also felt the ripple effect, and plummeted 17% on the same day. See Why Is DeepSeek Sinking Nvidia Stock? Chinese AI DeepSeek has open-sourced its R1 model, which has been shown to outperform leading models from OpenAI and Meta in various benchmarks. What’s more, this breakthrough technology is not only freely available but also offers a cost-efficient solution that requires fewer computing resources, making it an attractive proposition for the industry. The situation could have particular significance for Dell’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI servers. Dell’s revenue streams are diversified, with roughly half derived from personal computers (PCs) sales and related products, while the remaining half comes from its robust infrastructure business, including servers, where the company holds a dominant market position. While Dell’s Q3 sales grew 10% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $24.4 billion, the company’s client solutions group experienced a 1% y-o-y decline in revenue to $12.1 billion. Consumer sales within this segment plummeted 18% y-o-y. However, Dell’s infrastructure business emerged as a bright spot, growing 34% y-o-y to $11.4 billion - with server and networking revenue surging 58% y-o-y to $7.4 billion. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Dell’s investment in AI servers is poised to drive substantial growth in its infrastructure business, as the AI server market is projected to exceed $200 billion by 2029. While AI-powered servers are typically low-margin, the sheer scale of the market presents a compelling growth opportunity. This growth will likely be complemented by increasing revenue from AI-optimized PC sales on the consumer side. While Dell’s revenues may be held back somewhat by the struggling PC segment, a substantial PC upgrade cycle is anticipated in 2025. The current economic climate and rising inflation have led to delayed tech upgrades. However, the availability of AI-enabled PCs, combined with the impending end of Windows 10 support in October 2025, may prompt consumers to upgrade their machines to leverage next-generation technologies and ensure ongoing security updates. With AI empowering both legitimate users and hackers, the need for enhanced protection may further incentivize upgrades. Dell’s stock valuation remains relatively modest, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12, suggesting that the shares may still be undervalued. However, with the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned that the sales growth may be slower than anticipated. DELL stock has seen a 38% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -27% in 2022, 96% in 2023, and 53% in 2024. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. In conclusion, Dell’s attractive valuation, robust server and networking sales, and the impending PC refresh cycle position the company for potential outperformance, making it a compelling AI stock pick for 2025 and beyond. However, investors should exercise caution, as Dell’s business remains vulnerable to macroeconomic uncertainty and shifting industry trends.

Title: How DeepSeek’s AI Model Impacts AVGO Stock?

CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, saw its stock plunge over 17% on Monday, January 27. This can be attributed to the ripples DeepSeek created, sending tremors through the Silicon Valley. DeepSeek’s more efficient approach challenges the conventional wisdom that bigger and more expensive necessarily means better in AI development. The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek recently made waves by releasing their DeepSeek-R1 model as open-source software. What makes this noteworthy is that according to the lab’s research, DeepSeek-R1 achieves better performance than prominent models like OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama across various metrics. The model stands out not just for its performance, but also because it’s freely available, cost-efficient, and demands less computing resources than competitors. This development has caused concerns in the west, where major tech companies have typically focused on a resource-intensive approach — accumulating massive amounts of computing infrastructure. The situation could have particular significance for Broadcom’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI networking technology. But also see DeepSeek Could Boost Intel Stock. Broadcom’s revenue of 51.6 billion in fiscal 2024 (fiscal ends in October) was up a stellar 44% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion in late 2023. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. Broadcom’s business relies heavily on their networking products, which are crucial for data transfer in AI systems. If the market for premium AI chips experiences a downturn, amid the rise of DeepSeek, it could create a domino effect, potentially hurting sales of Broadcom’s supporting technologies and components. Investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for AVGO stock, taking into account the expected AI contribution. With the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned about the sales growth may be slower than earlier anticipated. AVGO stock has seen a solid 84% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 110% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with changes in the White House, and the DeepSeek update, could AVGO see a strong jump? We think that investors should tread with caution. This potential shift in the industry toward efficiency over raw power, combined with a broader slowdown, could create additional challenges for Broadcom’s business prospects. While AVGO stock took a plunge amid the rise of DeepSeek, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: What is DeepSeek? A look at the Chinese start-up poised to disrupt US AI dominance

The ranks of the heavyweights of the artificial intelligence world were shaken up seemingly overnight with news of an AI program made by a small Chinese start-up that can seemingly rival the best that OpenAI and other major AI leaders can provide.Enter DeepSeek, the company that is set to change the game for AI and threaten the unrivaled dominance US-based tech companies have had thus far.The fact that this is disruptive should come as no surprise. Just a week ago, most of the attention in the AI field was focused on the advancements of OpenAI, Meta, and more. Talk of AI super-agents, which are programs that can handle complex tasks and make decisions with a level of intelligence that could theoretically rival some of humanity's best and brightest, and the reveal of OpenAI's new Operator agent all seemed to point to continued American dominance in the sector. AI super-agents were poised to disrupt the labor market, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg having said that within 2025, it was possible that AI will become advanced enough that it could do the work of a mid-level software engineer.But the revelation of DeepSeek has seemingly blindsided the entire industry and sent quakes shaking through Wall Street. In just a week after being launched, it became the most downloaded free app in the US, the BBC reported.But what is DeepSeek? What makes it different from other AI companies? And more importantly, why is this making such major waves in the tech world?Here is everything you need to know.DeepSeek is a Chinese start-up established in 2023, owned by the hedge fund High-Flyer. The company released its first models for free in November of the same year, with continued and further refined models put out in 2024.On January 10, 2025, it released its first AI chatbot to the public. AdvertisementIts AI program is set up to work on the same level as OpenAI's ChatGPT, the AI platform said to be the gold standard for AI chatbots. Stay updated with the latest news! Subscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter Subscribe Now But what makes it so impressive is how it was able to be made at a fraction of the cost that larger US firms pay for the same results, as well as with a fraction of the high-end chips that its competitors use. According to The New York Times, DeepSeek only needed around 2,000 computer chips to train its AI model, specifically chips from Nvidia, whereas other companies use around 16,000 chips. This ended up costing around $6 million. For context, Meta spent around 10 times as much to develop its own AI.Already back in May 2024, DeepSeek made waves in China for its success at making a successful AI model at such a low price, which forced the country's preeminent leaders in the industry such as ByteDance and Baidu to slash their own AI model prices just to stay competitive.Now, it is making a similarly major impact on the US market, with Nvidia, one of the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world and a major leader in chip production, having lost nearly $600 billion in market value, the BBC reported. According to Reuters, Nvidia's stock tumble is the biggest single-session loss for any company.But what is especially significant is not only that a Chinese company made such major strides in AI development at a fraction of the cost compared to major US firms, but that it did so despite major US sanctions designed to curb China's AI advancements.How did China's DeepSeek develop despite US sanctions?The US had previously placed restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips to China in an effort to maintain American AI dominance compared to its chief economic rival.As a result, it was far more difficult for Chinese firms to get access to the necessary chips.However, as some experts noted, that seemed to only spur innovation as developers had to find ways of getting around these restrictions.This was, in part, helped by DeepSeek founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng, who stockpiled a few thousand advanced Nvidia AI chips before US sanctions went into place.However, just as important is the role of innovation in getting around the limited hardware Chinese companies have at their disposal, working with what they have and making breakthroughs as a result.How is the US reacting to DeepSeek?US President Donald Trump has long been hawkish about the US trade rivalry with China and has previously stated the importance of the United States being a dominant force in AI.DeepSeek seems to upend these claims. Buddy AI (credit: PR)Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Trump called DeepSeek a "wake-up call" directed at US tech firms. However, he also said it was a positive development, noting that it's good for US firms, too, if a company is able to do less and spend less on AI development and still get the same result.OpenAI CEO Sam Altman also noted DeepSeek's "impressive model" and referred to them as a new competitor, though also said that his company would "deliver much better models" in the future.Are the claims about DeepSeek true?While DeepSeek has been making ambitious claims, others claim that the AI's successes need to be taken with a grain of salt.One of the biggest arguments made by skeptics is that DeepSeek's AI breakthrough was only possible due to hoarding Nvidia chips or due to buying other advanced chips illegally,Speaking to CNN, Yale School of Management senior associate dean for leadership studies Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said that DeepSeek's breakthrough "is either truly disruptive or deceptive, relying on hoarded Nvidia chips and others before the export sanctions."In addition, others have voiced concern over data privacy and censorship due to policies by the Chinese government.According to multiple reports, the DeepSeek AI chatbot refused to discuss events such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and the Uyghur genocide in Xinjiang and responded to questions about Taiwanese independence by saying there is no such thing as an independent Taiwan and it is a part of China.This also comes as the US is currently grappling with concerns surrounding Chinese firms having access to US citizens' data. It remains to be seen how the tech sector will be impacted in the long term by these broader concerns.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Nvidia, Oracle Stocks Rebound After Monday’s Rout

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market Monday, initiating a massive selloff led by Nvidia, which roared back Tuesday, recovering almost half of its record-setting losses, before again struggling Wednesday. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $160 billion Wednesday morning. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

It was a rough day on Monday for the Nasdaq, down 612 points or 3.1%. and for four of the Magnificent 7 stocks. China’s DeepSeek hit Nvidia especially hard, down $24.20 or 17%, but three of the Mag 7 were up for the day, Amazon, Apple and Meta. Alphabet was the only other Mag 7 stock down more than the Nasdaq’s 3.1% decline coming in at 4.2% or $8.40. Six of the seven Mag 7 companies are reporting December quarter results over the next two weeks and Nvidia reports on February 26. Since Monday’s market reaction has snuffed some of the wind out of the AI and tech stocks, it could be beneficial as it may have lowered expectations, at least for the AI oriented companies. The projections below are from Yahoo Finance! and are based on a company’s fiscal year. Meta reports on Wednesday, January 29, after the market closes. The company has the second lowest P/E multiple of the Mag 7 at 26.0x but is middle of the pack for revenue growth at 14.4% and tied for the lowest EPS growth at 12%. · December 2025 revenue projection of $46.97 billion · December 2025 EPS projection of $6.75 · 2025 EPS projection of $25.42 of EPS is a 26.0x P/E multiple · 2025 revenue projection of $186 billion for a 14.4% growth rate · Earnings growth rate of 12% on 2025 projected earnings · PEG (P/E to growth) ratio is 2.1x on 2025 projected earnings · Market cap to 2024 revenue ratio is 10.2x · Market cap to 2025 revenue ratio is 9.0x Meta’s stock has been in a continuous uptrend for over two years.

Meta stock price chart Microsoft reports on Wednesday, January 29, after the market closes. The company is in the middle of the pack on five valuation metrics · December 2025 revenue projection of $68.82 billion · December 2025 EPS projection of $3.11 · 2025 EPS projection of $15.06 of EPS is a 28.9x P/E multiple · 2025 revenue projection of $319 billion for a 14.4% growth rate · Earnings growth rate of 16% on 2025 projected earnings · PEG (P/E to growth) ratio is 1.9x on 2025 projected earnings · Market cap to 2024 revenue ratio is 11.6x · Market cap to 2025 revenue ratio is 10.1x After a strong run from early 2023 to mid-2024 the shares have been trading in a range between 400 to 450. With an RSI of 52.46 (neutral territory) and closing a bit above its 50-day, 100-day and 200-day moving averages, the moving averages could become support or resistance. Microsoft stock price chart Tesla also reports on Wednesday, January 29, after the market closes.

Title: Nvidia experiences record $600 billion market value loss following DeepSeek-R1 AI model launch
URL: https://www.techspot.com/news/106534-nvidia-experiences-record-600-billion-market-value-loss.html
Time Published: 2025-01-28T13:18:00Z
Full Content:
What just happened? Nvidia has once again broken the record for the largest one-day decline of market value in US history. After the release of the open-source R1 AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which caused panic within the industry, Team Green's shares dropped 17%, resulting in its market cap falling by almost $600 billion. Nvidia's stock price crashed to $118.58 yesterday, wiping $593 billion off its value and marking the company's worst day on the market since the start of the pandemic – March 16, 2020. The loss has seen Nvidia lose its position as the world's biggest company by market cap as its valuation fell from $3.5 trillion to $2.9 trillion, making it less valuable than Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia's crash was the result of DeepSeek's free, open-source large language model called R1 that launched last week and is now the top app in the US Apple App store. The China-based firm says it trained its model with 671 billion parameters using just 2,048 Nvidia H800s and $5.6 million, which are tiny figures compared to the resources required by Alphabet, Meta and Amazon, who spend billions on their AI systems. DeepSeek's AI capabilities are said to be comparable to some of best available, including OpenAI's products. What makes this even more impressive is that DeepSeek created its model despite the limitations imposed by US export sanctions on China. The market's concern is that other companies will soon be able to replicate DeepSeek's achievement of creating high-end AI tools without spending billions on Nvidia's most expensive flagship GPUs. Nvidia's share price over the last month Other tech companies saw their share prices fall, with Arm, Broadcom and Oracle all crashing at least 10%. According to the Financial Post, the total market cap losses across US and European tech companies could exceed $1 trillion. DeepSeek's achievements have been praised by big Silicon Valley names such as Marc Andreessen and even Sam Altman, CEO of rival firm OpenAI, who called it an "impressive model." "We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!" Altman wrote. The record for the previous largest market cap fall also belongs to Nvidia. In September 2024, weak data on the state of the manufacturing sector from the Institute for Supply Management brought concerns about an economic slowdown. It led to $279 billion being wiped off the company's value, beating the $232 billion loss Meta suffered in February 2022. Nvidia's latest fall has also affected the wealth of CEO Jensen Huang, the company's largest individual shareholder, who saw his net worth drop $21 billion from $124.4 billion to $103.1 billion.

The software giant's stock price is up less than 8% in the past year. That's by far the weakest gain among the eight U.S. tech megacap companies. Apple has the next slimmest increase at 19%, followed by Alphabet at 26%. All the others are up at least 48%, and Tesla is the top performer in the group, up 117%. Microsoft is also badly trailing the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which has gained 25% in the past year. That's the backdrop heading into Microsoft's quarterly earnings report Wednesday. The company is kicking off tech earnings season, along with Meta and Tesla. Apple follows on Thursday, and Alphabet and Amazon report next week. The biggest question for Microsoft shareholders surrounds the company's Azure cloud-computing business and whether it will show accelerating growth. In October, Microsoft told investors that demand for Azure services outstripped supply because of a delay from a third-party provider. Finance chief Amy Hood said she still foresees an increase in Azure's growth rate in the first half of 2025, but for the December quarter, she called for 31% to 32% growth at constant currency, which would be down from 34% in the prior period. Microsoft's stock slipped 6% the next day. Since the last quarter of 2023, Azure growth has increased by 2 percentage points. Meanwhile, top rivals Amazon and Alphabet have seen cloud growth over that stretch accelerate by 7 points and 13 points, respectively. It's a matter of particular importance to investors, because Microsoft now has tens of billions of dollars in quarterly capital expenditures to meet cloud and AI needs of customers. A Microsoft spokesperson didn't provide a comment. Microsoft operates in many other markets. But investors gravitate to cloud first, because it's a sizable category that's still rapidly expanding as companies continue to move away from owning and operating their own data centers and as they add heftier workloads. Overall, Microsoft is expected to report revenue growth of 11% from a year earlier to $68.8 billion, according to LSEG. That would mark the slowest year-over-year growth for any quarter since mid-2023. Analysts expect earnings per share to increase to $3.11 from $2.93 a year ago. Investors were more bullish on Microsoft in 2023, sending the stock up more than 50%, its best year since 2009. The driving force was Microsoft's intimate relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which sparked the generative AI boom and led to a historic increase in investments. Microsoft is OpenAI's leading backer, having poured nearly $14 billion into the AI startup. Through the partnership, Microsoft gets a lot of cloud business but also spends heavily on building out infrastructure. The relationship changed in an important way last week, when Microsoft said OpenAI will no longer use Azure on an exclusive basis, except when it comes to handling incoming queries from developers. Going forward, OpenAI will have to check with Microsoft when it seeks more computing capacity, and Microsoft will be able to accept or turn away the request. The announcement came at the same time as President Donald Trump's introduction of Stargate, an AI infrastructure initiative involving SoftBank, OpenAI and Oracle. In its own blog post, OpenAI named Microsoft as a technology partner but not a member of the group that will build and operate Stargate, which has the potential to draw up to $500 billion in investment. Microsoft has committed to $80 billion in AI-related capital expenditures in the year that ends June 30. Much of that is being directed toward Nvidia's graphics processing units, or GPUs. Analysts at Cowen wrote in a report that last week's developments could help Microsoft reaccelerate the Azure growth rate into the mid-30s. They said Microsoft has been "funding GPU capex investments for OpenAI model training but not collecting revenue," and that by pushing some of that training elsewhere, the company can "show improved capex efficiencies and stronger returns on capital spend" while keeping its access to OpenAI. Kevin Walkush, a portfolio manager at Jensen Investment Management, said he expects the AI investment will pay off in the long run. "If AI doesn't show up, there's still a long runway for cloud," said Walkush, whose firm held about $913 million in Microsoft shares at the end of September. "But I think the chance of AI showing up is really high, so that's the bet I'm willing to let them make to take advantage of this opportunity."

Plus: With the release of its fourth quarter losses, Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches to six years, but the plane maker does have a path toward billions in revenue. Good morning, The debut of a new AI model from China’s DeepSeek sent markets into a frenzy Monday. DeepSeek, which released its open-source models for download in the U.S. earlier this month, surged to the top of the iOS App Store download charts. It’s been compared favorably to products from OpenAI and Meta, while appearing to be more efficient and cost-effective. The competition from the Chinese company spooked investors, tanking the fortunes of several notable billionaires, including Nvidia’s CEO and largest individual shareholder Jensen Huang. Huang’s net worth fell $20.8 billion by market close, and Oracle chairman Larry Ellison lost $27.6 billion, falling from the third-richest person on Earth to fifth. Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images Markets plunged Monday after the debut of DeepSeek, hitting tech stocks especially hard as the Nasdaq had its fourth-worst day of the last two years. Semiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia plunged 17%, losing $589 billion in market capitalization—by far the single greatest one-day value wipeout of any company in history. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek, calling it “a positive development” and a “wake-up call” for U.S. industries. MORE: A Forbes review found the AI model avoids answering questions about topics commonly censored by the Chinese government. Forbes asked DeepSeek five questions on controversial topics, like “What is Taiwan’s status with China?” and “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” Investor interest in the first big IPO of Trump 2.0—liquefied natural gas exporter Venture Global—has been lukewarm. The stock has already fallen nearly 20%, but it still solidifies Venture Global’s place in the public markets with an impressive $50 billion market cap. And the holdings of its cofounders now amount to $20 billion each. Jamel Toppin for Forbes Controversial billionaire Lululemon founder Chip Wilson’s bet on Amer Sports, the parent company of such brands as Arc’teryx and Salomon, appears to be paying off. Wilson, who left his role as Lululemon’s board chair in 2013 following his controversial comments about women’s bodies, sold shares of the company to buy a nearly 21% stake in Amer Sports. That investment is now worth about $3.2 billion, double its value when the company went public in February 2024.

The company said it has a “longstanding practice” of applying name changes when they have been “updated in official government sources.” President Donald Trump signed three executive orders Monday targeting military personnel in an expansion of his crackdown on DEI initiatives. The orders not only rescinded the military’s DEI practices, they also banned transgender individuals from serving, and reinstated service members who were fired for refusing the Covid-19 vaccine. There were around 14,000 transgender service members in the U.S. military as of 2018, according to CNN. Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images Tickets to watch the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles face off in the Super Bowl are listed for as much as $56,000 on the secondary market, indicating that this year’s championship game could be the priciest in NFL history. The cheapest seats on Gametime were available for $6,492 per ticket, though Super Bowl tickets typically decline in price in the two weeks leading up to game day. In a memo issued Monday, the acting director of the National Institutes of Health reiterated that the Department of Health and Human Services has “issued a pause” on communications and public appearances by agency staff. But the document also states that clinical trials at the NIH and its funded institutions are ongoing. Still, NIH staffers remain frustrated, with one source saying that “there have never been politics in the NIH. When politics is suddenly becoming involved, that’s where the fear in large part is coming from.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reportedly received guidance to immediately stop working with the World Health Organization, following President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the United Nations agency. While Trump can withdraw the United States from WHO, the U.S. must give a “one-year notice” and meet its financial obligations to the agency for that fiscal year, according to a joint resolution from 1948. The IRS has made moves to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order freezing hiring for most federal agencies. The agency is revoking some job offers and removing job postings. And last week, Trump suggested he might fire IRS employees—or send them to the border. The Boeing logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in 2020. TOPLINE When it comes to losing money, Boeing is an overperformer—of historic proportion. On Thursday, the beleaguered plane maker pre-announced a net loss of $5.46 per share for the fourth quarter of 2024, which pencils out to about $3.8 billion. That’s a stunning $11.8 billion loss for the year, the second largest in Boeing history. The lousy news is partly due to the disruption of a seven-week strike by Boeing’s machinists that halted production of the company’s bestselling plane, the 737 Max. It’s also a result of costly, chronic delays on key programs in Boeing’s defense division. And then there are the company’s seemingly endless struggles to straighten out production problems with the 737 Max and 787. Boeing’s financial losing streak now stretches six years, starting with the grounding of the 737 Max in 2019 following two deadly crashes. Its total losses since that time: a staggering $35.7 billion. Despite Boeing’s dismal run, institutional investors have been willing to shore up the company’s finances thanks to the company’s fat order book of 5,595 planes, which should convert into billions in revenue if new CEO Kelly Ortberg can get its production lines humming smoothly again. The company raised $24 billion late last year through a sale of stock and convertible debt. WHY IT MATTERS Fourth-quarter earnings season isn’t done yet, but Boeing’s discouraging 2024 results are almost certain to bolster the company’s lead as the biggest loser in the S&P 500 index since 2019, according to data from FactSet. Uber, which was running a close second to Boeing through 2023, is expected to report a profit for 2024. MORE Why Boeing Needs A New Plane — Soon Hosting a Super Bowl party at home will cost roughly the same as last year for a group of 10, according to Wells Fargo’s Super Bowl Food report. The price of some items, like avocados and chicken wings, significantly increased, but they were balanced out by major decreases for chips and certain vegetables: $139: The average cost of a game day gathering featuring fan favorites, just 0.1% more than last year 11.9%: The year-over-year increase in the price of cherry tomatoes, which saw the biggest jump 0.7% to 5.1%: The decline in prices for nacho cheese dip, salsa, tortilla chips and potato chips from 2024 Many organizations struggle with company culture, even as it remains critically important: Employees who feel connected to their organization are four times more likely to be engaged at work, research shows. Start by honestly assessing your company’s current culture, prioritize employee wellbeing to prevent burnout and communicate a compelling vision for a potential culture shift.

Title: AAPL climbed 3% on DeepSeek news, as other tech stocks fell

While shock at yesterday’s DeepSeek news saw the stock prices of many tech giants fall, AAPL climbed 3.25% across the course of the day. Experts yesterday expressed amazement at the Chinese company’s AI model being on a par with US chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Llama despite being developed for a fraction of the cost and running on far lower-spec hardware … DeepSeek is an AI chatbot developed in China, and which posted benchmarks indicating that its performance was comparable to the world’s best existing models. Experts quickly verified the claims, expressing shock that China was able to achieve this at a fraction of the development cost of US models, and running locally on very modestly-specced PCs. Many said that the scale of this achievement cannot be over-stated. The app quickly climbed to the #1 slot in Apple’s App Store. The biggest shock was how China was able to develop such a powerful AI model while US export controls limited the number of Nvidia GPUs it was able to purchase. We noted yesterday that chatbots from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic use more than half a million of these, while DeepSeek was only able to obtain around 50,000 GPUs – meaning it’s delivering comparable results with only 10% of the processing power. It was previously thought that there was a direct correlation between the number of Nvidia processors and AI performance, so evidence to the contrary saw Nvidia shares slump. The results sent a shockwave through markets on Monday, with Nvidia on course to lose more than $300bn of market value, the biggest recorded drop for any company, as investors reassessed the likely future investment in AI hardware. The share value of other US AI players like Microsoft and Meta similarly fell. There was, however, an exception to the trend: AAPL stock climbed 3.25% in the course of the day. Daring Fireball’s John Gruber suggested that a key reason might be that it validates Apple’s approach of aiming to run as much AI stuff as it can on-device. Its own AI servers are the next recourse, with ChatGPT as fallback. There has been skepticism about just how many Apple Intelligence features can be powered by the company’s own device chips, rather than having powerful servers do the lifting, but DeepSeek runs on rather ordinary PCs – suggesting that Apple’s approach could be far more successful than anyone has so far imagined. A vast increase in the inference capabilities of RAM-constrained hardware strongly suggests that Apple’s consumer devices will soon be able to perform far more AI functionality locally. Whether or not he’s correct about the impact on the share price, there’s no arguing that Apple’s case for on-device processing just got way more credible.

DeepSeek, an artificial intelligence lab based in Hangzhou, released a reasoning model called R1 last week that outperformed OpenAI's latest model in many third-party tests. In late December, DeepSeek launched a free, open-source large language model that it said took only two months and less than $6 million to build. The startup was founded in 2023. While there's plenty of skepticism surrounding DeepSeek's claims, the latest pronouncements caused a panic on Wall Street due to the potential implications of significantly cheaper AI models coming sooner rather than later. Nvidia's stock price plummeted 17% on Monday, its steepest drop since the early days of the Covid pandemic in March 2020. The sell-off wiped out almost $600 billion in market cap, the biggest one-day loss ever for a U.S. company. Shares of chipmaker Broadcom, which has also benefited from the AI boom, also dropped 17%. And Oracle, Dell, Super Micro Computer and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise all saw steep declines because they sell servers packed with Nvidia graphics processing units. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla all report quarterly results Wednesday and are among the megacap tech companies spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure, with the biggest checks going to pay for Nvidia's GPUs. Apple reports results Thursday, followed by Alphabet and Amazon next week. The big immediate issues for those companies with respect to DeepSeek are less about revenue and more about costs. It's a topic they tend to spend a lot of time talking about on earnings calls. "The sheer efficiency of DeepSeek's pre and post training framework (if true) raises the question as to whether or not global hyperscalers and governments, that have and continue to invest significant capex dollars into AI infrastructure, may pause to consider the innovative methodologies that have come to light with DeepSeek's research," wrote analysts at Stifel in a report Monday. Investors hope to get some initial answers in earnings reports this week and next. Nvidia doesn't report until late February, and Broadcom is expected to announce results in March. Here's how DeepSeek could come up on this week's earnings calls. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Friday that his company plans to invest around $60 billion to $65 billion in capital expenditures in 2025 as it bulks up its AI infrastructure. Zuckerberg talks extensively about AI on his company's quarterly updates, and likes to tout advancements in its open-source Llama family of LLMs. Given how much Meta spends on Nvidia GPUs, any change in the market dynamics is of deep interest to shareholders. Some tech investors have expressed concern about the hefty amount of spending on AI relative to the immediate returns companies are seeing. Ralph Schackart, an analyst at William Blair, told CNBC that DeepSink's recent claims about its allegedly cheaper and quicker-to-train open source AI model "caught everybody by surprise, but it's hard to know whether that investment is real or not." Meta's stock price rose almost 2% on Monday, garnering a very different response from Wall Street compared with Nvidia and the other hardware companies. The potential of lower costs could be a boon for Meta. But, like Llama, DeepSeek is open source, so there's also the possible competitive threat if developers gravitate to another model. The one thing Schackart said investors can be sure of is that Meta will continue investing in AI. "There's too much to gain or lose by not investing," he said. Microsoft slid 2.1% on Monday, a drop that was narrower than the overall tech market's decline. Among the large software and internet companies, Microsoft is closest to the AI boom due to its intimate relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The roughly $14 billion that Microsoft has pumped into OpenAI has been critical for the startup, which needs boatloads of GPUs to build and run its models. DeepSeek is going directly up against OpenAI. In a post on X late Monday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called R1 "an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price." He added that OpenAI will deliver better models, but that it's "legit invigorating to have a new competitor!" In addition to funneling money to OpenAI, Microsoft is a big spender on its own when it comes to GPUs for its AI products and its Azure cloud-computing service. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said the rise of DeepSeek is a positive development for the company because of the possibility of lower capital expenditures. However, Oppenheimer analyst Timothy Horan sees DeepSeek as a negative sign for Microsoft, which "has bet more on proprietary models (OpenAI) and higher-cost hardware," he wrote in a report. Microsoft said Jan. 3 that it plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on the construction of data centers that can handle AI workloads. On his social network, X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who also runs SpaceX, expressed doubt that DeepSeek's models were created on the reportedly low budget of under $10 million. But Musk showed appreciation for DeepSeek's technical achievements. Musk has a history in the space. He was a co-founder of OpenAI, when it was launched as a nonprofit in 2015, but he's now involved in a heated legal battle with the company and Altman and is suing to stop OpenAI from transforming into a for-profit entity. Musk is also founder of AI startup and OpenAI competitor xAI, which is raising billions of dollars, largely to buy Nvidia GPUs. At Tesla, Musk has been ramping up AI spending as the company works toward building a fleet of self-driving cars. Musk has talked about his company's sizable AI investments as a key advantage. He said in a post on X in April that Tesla would spend $10 billion for the year "in combined training and inference AI." UBS analysts wrote in a note Monday that, "greater efficiency to both model training and inference can help advance, and eventually proliferate," autonomous vehicles. However, they added that affordable open-source models "could break the narrative that the more capital put into compute and infrastructure, the more likely the probability of success, thereby lessening any 'moat'" Tesla has established. Tesla shares fell 2.3% on Monday. Investors didn't express any concern about Apple on Monday. The stock rose 3.2% for the day, outperforming all of its closest peers. Apple is less profligate than its rivals in terms of capital expenditures. In the company's latest fiscal year, it spent $9.5 billion on capex, 14% less than in 2023. Unlike some of its tech competitors, Apple doesn't run a cloud service that rents out computing capacity. The company's big AI bet so far has been around Apple Intelligence, its suite of software for iPhones and Macs that can summarize text and generate images. Apple's suite runs on its own chips, either on the user's device or on the company's servers. For training its models, Apple has published research saying that its initial models for Apple Intelligence used Google's proprietary Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, a chip that's more limited than a GPU but can handle some AI tasks. Apple contracts with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its Siri voice assistant, which is powered by pricey Nvidia GPUs. That's a topic that could be of interest to analysts after the DeepSeek developments. However, while neither company has publicly confirmed the deal underpinning the partnership, analysts have expressed doubt that Apple is paying for the ChatGPT access.

DeepSeek AI is making headlines because the Chinese startup has developed cutting-edge and cost-effective large-language models using fewer GPUs than systems costing billions from companies like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. With the company's flagship R1 model performing on par with OpenAI's o1, this has spilled over to the financial markets, where NVIDIA's stock dipped to the point where it saw the biggest single-day drop in US history. Despite its market cap dropping by several hundreds of billions, NVIDIA recently released a statement praising DeepSeek as "an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling." DeepSeek's efforts are being widely praised because it didn't require billions of dollars of AI hardware to train. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman released a short statement earlier today on social media on DeepSeek R1, praising it as an "impressive model" while teasing "much better models" coming soon from the company. He also said that OpenAI will bring a few releases forward in response to DeepSeek's surprising and immediate success. While also teasing AGI. "DeepSeek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price," Sam Altman wrote on X. "We will obviously deliver much better models, and also, it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor! We will pull up some releases." "But mostly, we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission," Sam Altman adds, hinting that OpenAI won't be scaling back its use of countless GPUs for its training anytime soon. "The world is going to want to use a lot of AI and really be quite amazed by the next-gen models coming. We look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond."

Title: Nvidia Stock Goes Down—And The Internet Cracks Up

A Nvidia logo is seen on a smartphone with stock market percentages on the background. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Dominika Zarzycka/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The biggest market loss in history happened on Jan. 27, with with Nvidia stock plummeting 17% by the close of U.S. markets. This led to a record $589 billion loss in market capitalization. Stockbrokers and investors panicked, but how did the online world react? Well, it did what it does best: joked about the whole debacle. The Nvidia stock drop story is an interesting case study about the meta-ness and circularity of the internet; specifically about how social media can influence financial markets and then mock that very influence. To reach that conclusion, though, we have to understand precisely what’s happening with Nvidia stock, and why it’s dropping. Over the past week, the launch of a new artificial intelligence (AI) model called DeepSeek R1 sent shockwaves through the tech industry. Without getting bogged down in detail, this open-source AI is reported to deliver the same performance as models from other companies, such as OpenAI, but at a far lower cost. In other words, DeepSeek R1 needs less processing power to complete the same tasks. Nvidia makes the hardware (GPUs) that these big AI models need, so improved efficiency means that, potentially, companies need less of its gear. This is one of the key reasons why Nvidia stock nosedived. Following the launch of DeepSeek, Nvidia’s future seems less bright to some investors. There are a few different ways social media responded to Nvidia stock plummeting. One of the most common involve people making memes about the lowering price: Others repurposed popular meme formats to join in: While different accounts took a more surreal approach with their jokes: It isn’t just all pure japes and memes though. Some people online also tried to contextualize what’s happening with Nvidia stock: Or talk about the absurdity of Nvidia’s stock price in general: The common thread throughout all of these is a sense of humor, but why? What’s happening for the internet to act this way? While there are a variety of threads that can explain why social media has reacted the way it has to the Nvidia stock drop—including schadenfreude at the downfall of a company—one of the most interesting tends is the sense of meta-ness at play in the story. One reason that stories about DeepSeek have spread far and wide is down to social media. Because, as research published on Scientific Reports shows, extreme opinions receive more likes on platforms, this means that, on average, a post saying DeepSeek is going to destroy the AI industry will get more engagement than a more balanced one. More likes tends to equate to more views, meaning stories that predict a rocky future for Nvidia stock likely get more traction online than those which are more objective. While some believe this doesn’t have any real impact in the world, studies suggest otherwise. Social media has been shown to directly impact stock prices. In a paper from Nature, researchers “discovered significant short-term and long-term relationships between social media discussions and market behaviour.” While these platforms are far from the sole reason Nvidia stock and the like can rise and fall, they do have an impact. And this is where things get particularly interesting. People mocking Nvidia stock on social media are, in some sense, mocking the fact that social media had something to do with it. The internet is almost like a snake eating its own tail. Social media helped drive down Nvidia’s stock price and is also the place where people make fun of that happening. It’s a never-ending cycle. Ultimately, whether people know it consciously or not, there’s a sense of ridiculousness that something as seemingly silly as posting on social media can impact the fortunes of one of the most valuable companies in the entire world. It’s meta, it’s self-referential, but, most of all, it’s a sign of the strangeness of the modern world. So what comes next? It’s likely that, at some point, Nvidia stock will recover, but after that? The only certainty is whatever happens with AI, the economy and the world in general, social media is sure to joke about it. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Chinese Quant Whiz Built DeepSeek In The Shadow Of a Hedge Fund Rout

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Three years ago, Liang Wenfeng’s quantitative hedge fund firm apologized profusely to investors for losing money during a tumultuous period for China’s stock market. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump’s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding Budapest Mayor Aims to Block Orban’s Plans to Build ‘Mini Dubai’ It was a surprising stumble for Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management, which used artificial intelligence to pick stocks and had grown rapidly to become one of the country’s largest quant funds. As the firm navigated through that crisis and its assets shrunk by more than a third from a peak of more than $12 billion, behind the scenes Liang was laying the groundwork for a new AI startup, DeepSeek. DeepSeek, which grew out of High-Flyer, is now threatening to upend the global artificial intelligence supply chain and challenge the seemingly-unassailable US lead in critical frontier AI technologies. The sudden popularity of the 20-month-old firm’s breakthrough technology and its namesake app sparked a massive US and European stock rout on Monday, wiping out close to $1 trillion in combined market value from chip giant Nvidia Corp. and other peers. It has also drawn shock and awe over how Liang, an engineering graduate who has never studied or worked outside of mainland China, pulled off such a feat. He has demonstrated that with local artificial intelligence engineers, constrained access to the latest semiconductor technologies and limited resources, it is possible to match — and even surpass — the best in the field. “Every country in the world could have that kind of a project going on, if they can acquire the talent and be able to work on it, of course. The rest of the industry is going to learn from this,” said Shuman Ghosemajumder, co-founder and CEO of Reken, a San Francisco-based AI startup. The question now gripping investors, companies and policymakers is whether artificial intelligence requires hundreds of billions of dollars in capital expenditure to come up with the latest innovations and vanguard AI models — and whether export controls can hold off Chinese competition. Follow The Big Take daily podcast wherever you listen. Liang has been compared to OpenAI founder Sam Altman, but the Chinese citizen keeps a much lower profile and seldom speaks publicly. “OpenAI is not a god and cannot always be at the forefront,” Liang told Chinese media outlet 36Kr in July 2024. The previous year, Liang said more investment doesn’t necessarily lead to more innovation. He has also opined on how Chinese companies have long been mostly followers as opposed to technology innovators. The problem has been a “lack of confidence and not knowing how to organize high-density talents to achieve effective innovation,” he was quoted as saying. An Outlier Liang was born in 1985 in Zhanjiang, an economically poor city in China’s southern Guangdong province. His father was an elementary school teacher. He studied electronic engineering at Zhejiang University, a prestigious college in the city of Hangzhou, and also earned a master’s degree in information and communication engineering there. High-Flyer was as much an outlier in China’s quant industry as DeepSeek is to the global AI industry. Liang and two of his former university classmates started dabbling in domestic stocks in 2008. Unlike the founders of most Chinese quant funds, none of them had overseas or institutional trading experience. The trio tried different strategies from discretionary trading to arbitrage, before settling on using a systematic approach to implement trading ideas in 2015, the year they set up High-Flyer. They initially built a model based on price-and-volume factors, before trying machine learning in 2016. The new tool allowed the firm to dig deeper to find new factors and identify “non-linear” connections between factors, its chief executive officer Simon Lu said in an interview in 2020. The founders integrated machine learning into High-Flyer products in 2018. AI allowed High-Flyer to achieve “a lot of innovations” and develop a multi-strategy, multi-cycle investment model to “pile up” returns from different sources of returns, according to a 2020 brochure for the firm. Its flagship product benchmarked against the CSI 500 Index integrated low-risk strategies like intra-day trading, allowing it to beat the gauge by a combined 120 percentage points in the previous three years, it showed. High-Flyer grew assets quickly as a result, reaching more than 90 billion yuan in 2021 before it stumbled later that year. In December 2021, after experiencing record drawdowns at some funds, High-Flyer said its artificial intelligence mistimed some trades and performed poorly during periods of large stock swings. “We feel deeply guilty,” it told investors. The firm also stopped accepting fresh inflows and said it would reduce its assets under management and adjust its strategies. Three months later, its marketing head warned that certain volatility-sensitive clients should redeem their money — a highly unusual move. Last year, High-Flyer said it would wind down products that had made two-way bets on the markets, and focus on “long-only” strategies in which it took only bullish positions on stocks. Its assets under management have dropped to around 60 billion yuan. Research Funding DeepSeek’s research was funded by High-Flyer’s R&D budget, Liang said previously. It drew computing resources from the quant fund, which had amassed 10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, prior to US bans on exports of sophisticated Nvidia chips and other graphics processing units. Liang recruited engineering talent almost exclusively from China. Many were fresh out of top universities, interns in their final leg of doctoral studies and Olympiad medal holders. “He’s a nerd but nerd in this context is not a negative,” said Zihan Wang, a Ph.D. student at Northwestern University who did a six-month internship at DeepSeek in 2024. Wang said Liang ran many experiments on his own, and DeepSeek operated much like a research lab. “It started small, but as they got real progress, they started to get excited,” he said. The startup began periodically releasing models, seemingly impervious to — even stirred up by — the US ban on exports of cutting-edge AI accelerator chips. DeepSeek released its R1 advanced AI reasoning model on Jan. 20, the same day Donald Trump was sworn in as America’s 47th president. Earlier that Monday, Liang attended a closed-door business symposium in Beijing that was hosted by Chinese Premier Li Qiang. There, experts in technology, science, education and other fields offered their opinions and suggestions for a draft government work report, according to the official Xinhua news agency. Video footage on YouTube shows Liang sitting across the table from Li and speaking, with the Chinese leader nodding attentively. Significantly, DeepSeek open sourced its R1, allowing researchers and developers to freely use, modify and commercialize the model. That sent a signal that it wants to collaborate and innovate with others in the global AI community. Liang stands out among Chinese entrepreneurs because of that non-commercial goal, his laser-focus on research and the realization of Artificial General Intelligence, said Thomas Qitong Cao, assistant professor of technology policy at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Liang is assumed to own 51% of High-Flyer. That would give him a stake worth $71 million based on a comparative analysis, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. If DeepSeek reaches the same potential as OpenAI, valued at roughly $150 billion, the founder could potentially be in line for a massive windfall. Some have questioned whether Liang’s DeepSeek is as promising as it appears. Shortcomings include the startup’s infrastructure’s ability to handle global traffic waiting to try its service, or the app’s handling of sensitive subjects such as the 1989 protests in Tiananmen Square and queries on Chinese leader Xi Jinping. Experts have also questioned the assumption that DeepSeek was building with 10,000 A100 Nvidia chips, with analysts like Dylan Patel speculating that DeepSeek needs at least 50,000 of Nvidia’s far-more powerful chips, the H100s. Meta Platforms Inc., for instance, operates the equivalent of 600,000 Nvidia H100s. Still, Liang is prompting a rethink and re-calibration in the global AI ecosystem. It’s made obvious that the “The AI race won’t be won by creating the most sophisticated model; it’ll be won by embedding AI into business systems to generate tangible economic value,” said Mike Capone, chief executive officer of Qlik, a data analytics and artificial intelligence platform. --With assistance from Biz Carson, Pui Gwen Yeung and Pei Yi Mak.

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market Monday, initiating a massive selloff led by Nvidia, which roared back Tuesday, recovering almost half of its record-setting losses, before again struggling Wednesday. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $160 billion Wednesday morning. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

The launch of DeepSeek V3 has sent shockwaves through the US stock and crypto markets. Word that the AI model built by Chinese startup DeepSeek is superior to its American counterparts has made the US markets and AI industry see red. Not only is DeepSeek the most resource-efficient AI model the world has seen, but it outperforms the likes of ChatGPT 4o, Claude, and Llama. And that isn’t even the most scary part. DeepSeek offers superior results at a fraction of the cost of competitors like OpenAI, Google, and Meta. While OpenAI has been raising $18B with the goal of plowing it into massive data centers and other infrastructure, DeepSeek has built a super-efficient model for a mere $5.5M. This single move has shattered the myth that AI is a capital-intensive domain reserved for the big players. Investors are worried that DeepSeek’s cost-effective model could disrupt the current AI landscape, leading to increased competitive pressure on established players. This has resulted in a negative sentiment towards tech stocks and cryptos, particularly those heavily invested in AI. As a case in point, AI leader Nvidia was the worst-hit company on NASDAQ yesterday. Its shares fell by 17%, the worst one-day fall to date. This wiped off $593B in the company’s market cap, the highest capitalization loss ever for a Wall Street company. AI crypto tokens also experienced the impact of the DeepSeek saga. The AI category on Coingecko is down 6% in the last 24 hours, with AI agent coins losing 11% and AI agent launchpads losing 24.6%. After a hit like this, it’s going to take some real self-reflection to get the AI agent market back on track. Moving ahead, it’s possible that only tokens with a notably streamlined and elegant approach will attract investment. Cue MIND of Pepe ($MIND). $MIND is an autonomous AI agent that monitors, participates in, and propels meme coin discussions and interactions on various social media platforms. Through listening, collaborating, and learning, it forms its own conclusions and delivers real-time actionable insights for $MIND token holders. The $MIND AI agent comes as the answer to the information overload in the crypto space, which makes it difficult for the average investor to identify the best assets to invest in. $MIND – a self-evolving AI agent, solves this through hive-mind analysis. $MIND is a streamlined AI token project that provides token holders with early access to insights, opportunities, and trends. The $MIND presale is currently live and has already raised $4.1M so far. You can buy the token from the official presale website for just $0.0032144 right now. However, the next price increase is set to take place in less than 2 days, meaning this may be the lowest price you’ll ever get $MIND for. Moreover, since it’s still early days for the presale, investors can choose to stake their holdings and earn a sizable reward of 537% APY. The developers have reserved 15% for staking rewards. 20% of the token supply has been kept aside for marketing, which is going into building a strong community of $MIND holders. The project already has around 14K followers on X and an active Telegram community. Another 10% of the supply is reserved for listing and 30% for long-term project development. All in all, this is sound tokenomics. The $MIND presale has attracted a lot of investors (both retail and whales), and if it proves AI agents can be lean, mean, and profitable machines, could turn out to be the next 100x meme coin. Interested? All you need to do to buy $MIND is head over to MIND of Pepe’s official presale website, connect your crypto wallet, and buy the number of tokens you want. Ensure you have enough funds for gas fees, though. If you need further assistance, here’s a step-by-step guide on how to buy $MIND. However, since crypto markets are at a dicey junction, it’s important to do your own research before investing.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. DeepSeek, a little-known Chinese start-up whose affordable technology matches the likes of the most formidable American tech titans such as OpenAI and Meta Platforms, has raised investor concerns over the necessity of pouring billions of dollars into research and development. The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company released its open-source reasoning model, R1, earlier this month. The model's capabilities roughly match those of advanced models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google while having significantly lower training costs. "The impressive performance/cost dynamics have raised investor concerns about the necessity of the billions of dollars of capital expenditures by large US tech companies and the billions more they are planning to spend on generative AI in the coming years," said Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst from Morningstar. Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. Large US tech companies may follow suit and replicate some of the AI training techniques that DeepSeek leveraged to drive the cost of R1 down, he said in a research note on Tuesday. When DeepSeek launched, it quickly became the most downloaded app in Apple's US AppStore. The better-than-expected performance of DeepSeek led to a sell-off of Nvidia and tech peers on Wall Street on Monday. Its shares plunged 17 per cent to US$118.58, erasing almost US$600 billion of market value. Nvidia's logo and a decreasing stock graph are seen in this illustration taken January 27, 2025.

Photo: Reuters> "This was bound to happen, and it could have come from anywhere," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at French investment bank Natixis. "It came from China, all the more so, in a way, to see a correction." Wei Sun, principal analyst for AI at Counterpoint Research, said the Nvidia sell-off reflects shifting perceptions in AI development. "DeepSeek's success challenges the belief that larger models and more computing power drive better performance, posing a threat to Nvidia's GPU-driven growth strategy," Sun said. "It also questions the need for massive investments like the US$500 billion Stargate Project. By achieving cutting-edge results with fewer resources, DeepSeek highlights the potential of efficient innovation over sheer scale, marking a turning point in the AI race." While the correction may have been an initial reaction to the hype around DeepSeek, Garcia-Herrero said she does not believe it would be a permanent correction. "The US is going to double down on investment in AI," she said. "There will be more money in the US for the AI industry, if not more than before. Because [previously] it was kind of the understanding that China was falling behind, especially in Gen AI and now we see that was not the case." US President Donald Trump has called DeepSeek's strong showing a "wake-up call" and "positive" for America's tech sector. He also warned that he would slap tariffs on foreign-made semiconductors, including chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company or TSMC, if they do not start producing them stateside. Despite DeepSeek not having access to leading AI accelerators, such as Nvidia's best Hopper and Blackwell products, its large-language model (LLM) is believed to be on par with some of the best models released by OpenAI and others. "DeepSeek raises concerns that future LLMs will be developed with fewer AI GPUs from Nvidia, lower capital expenditure from hyperscalers, and perhaps less of a need for a massive energy buildout in the US," said Brian Colello, strategist at Morningstar. Nvidia on Monday responded to the hype generated by the Chinese AI firm and said its advances show the usefulness of its chips for the Chinese market and that more of its chips would be needed in the future to meet demand for DeepSeek's services. DeepSeek claims to have trained its model on only 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs over a two-month period, which at US$2 per hour explains the US$5 million headline number announced. This is driving a reassessment of AI investment strategies, focusing attention on the sustainability of AI capital expenditures, the AI competitive landscape, and the monetisation of AI, according to Richard Clode, a portfolio manager at Janus Henderson. DeepSeek is charging significantly less than OpenAI to use its models - about 20-40 times lower- according to Janus Henderson. This adds to concern about AI monetisation, given the extraordinary amounts of capital outlay deployed in the West. Last year, OpenAI said it closed a long-awaited funding round at a valuation of US$157 billion, including the US$6.6 billion the company raised from an extensive roster of investment firms and big tech companies, including Microsoft and Nvidia. Analysts say that DeepSeek shows a Chinese company can compete with the best-of-breed AI companies in the US, despite the current restrictions on Chinese access to advanced US semiconductor technology. "The breakthrough could be that DeepSeek can achieve a state-of-the-art model without state-of-the-art equipment," according to analysts at ING. According to ING, the market needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.

Title: OpenAI’s Sam Altman vows ‘better models’ as China’s DeepSeek disrupts global AI race

OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said he would fast-track product releases and “deliver much better models” after advances by Chinese start-up DeepSeek undermined Silicon Valley’s lead in a global artificial intelligence arms race. DeepSeek’s generative AI chatbot, a direct rival to ChatGPT, is able to perform some tasks at the same level as recently released models from OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta, despite claims it cost a fraction of the money and time to develop. The release of DeepSeek’s R1 model last week and its rise to the top of Apple’s App Store has triggered a tech stock sell-off. Asian tech shares fell on Tuesday in the wake of a Wall Street rout overnight. The Nasdaq fell 3 per cent and US chipmaker Nvidia, which produces the chips used to train large AI models, slumped 17 per cent, losing $600 billion (€570 billion) in market capitalisation. On Monday evening, Altman wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model was “impressive, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price”. He added: “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman, who last week announced that investors including SoftBank would spend up to $500 billion to build a network of data centres to power its AI models, added that computing resources were “more important now than ever before”. Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Oracle have earmarked $310 billion in 2025 for capital expenditure, which includes AI infrastructure, according to data compiled by Visible Alpha. Such estimates have been based on the premise that huge amounts of computing power will be needed to advance AI capabilities. But DeepSeek’s ability to compete on a fraction of the budget of OpenAI — which was recently valued at $157 billion — and rivals Anthropic, Google and Meta, has raised questions about the vast sums being poured into training systems. “The winners won’t be the ones burning the most cash,” said Aidan Gomez, founder of Toronto-based Cohere, which builds large language models for enterprises. Instead, he said, they would be those “finding efficient solutions”. The advances by DeepSeek have also exposed risks for venture capitalists who put almost $100 billion into US AI start-ups last year. “There’s now an open weight model floating around the internet which you can use to bootstrap any other sufficiently powerful base model into being an AI reasoner,” said Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, in a blog on Monday. “AI capabilities worldwide just took a one-way ratchet forward,” he added. “Kudos to DeepSeek for being so bold as to bring such a change into the world!” DeepSeek’s success has complicated the argument that massive cash piles create an unassailable advantage, which has helped leading Silicon Valley labs raise tens of billions of dollars over the past year. “If you’re Anthropic or OpenAI, attempting to be at the forefront, and someone can serve what you can at a tenth of the cost, that’s problematic,” said Mike Volpi, who led Index Ventures’ investment into Cohere. The sudden release of DeepSeek’s latest model surprised some at Meta. “The main frustration is, ‘Why didn’t we come up with this first?’ when we have thousands of the brightest minds working on this,” said one Meta employee. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg — who last week said he expected to allocate up to $65 billion in capital spending to expand AI teams and build a new data centre — has advocated for open source, positioning Meta at its forefront in the US. “We want the US to set the global AI standard, not China,” the company said in response to DeepSeek. Meta’s chief AI scientist Yann LeCun said “running AI assistant services for billions” would still require large levels of computing power. Rival company insiders and investors have expressed scepticism about the low costs cited by DeepSeek in developing its models. In December, the company said its V3 model, which its app’s chatbot runs on, cost just $5.6mn to train. However, it added that this figure was only for the final training run, not the complete cycle, and excluded “the costs associated with prior research and...experiments on architectures, algorithms, or data”. DeepSeek has attributed its success — despite using inferior chips to its US competitors — to methods that allow the AI model to selectively focus on specific parts of input data as a way of reducing the costs of running the model. For its latest R1 model, it used a reinforcement learning technique, a relatively new approach to AI in which models teach themselves how to improve without human supervision. The company also used open-source models, including Alibaba’s Qwen and Meta’s Llama, to fine tune its R1 reasoning model. The technical advances and investor interest in DeepSeek’s progress could light a fire under AI companies. “In general, we expect the bias to be on improved capability, sprinting faster towards artificial general intelligence, more than reduced spending,” said research firm Rosenblatt on Monday. Researchers and investors, including Marc Andreessen, have drawn parallels between the race between the US and China on artificial general intelligence and its competition with the Soviet Union during the cold war, both in space exploration and nuclear weapons development. Stuart Russell, professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley, said the race to AGI was “worse”. “Even the CEOs who are engaging in the race have stated that whoever wins has a significant probability of causing human extinction in the process, because we have no idea how to control systems more intelligent than ourselves,” he said. “In other words, the AGI race is a race towards the edge of a cliff.” - Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025Sign up for the Business Today newsletter and get the latest business news and commentary in your inbox every weekday morning Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Trillion-dollar disruptor: China's DeepSeek upends AI world overnight
URL: https://newatlas.com/ai-humanoids/deepseek-ai/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T07:17:00Z
Full Content:
The US AI giants got a wake-up call this week, when fledgling Chinese firm DeepSeek wiped a record-breaking trillion dollars off the value of heavyweights like Nvidia and OpenAI. The technology's gatekeepers are rattled – and they have good reason to be, as DeepSeek's model R1 shows how the costly existing roadmap is no longer the only way forward. This game-changing event is on the back of the company's latest AI model – DeepSeek-R1 – being released for use on smartphones across the globe, following desktop launch on January 10. DeepSeek has been on our radar for a few weeks, after its chatbot V3 dropped on December 26 and was reported to have performed as well as the leading US GPTs (generative pre-trained transformers) – something that few news outlets covered at the time (including us). With the AI frontrunners – all US companies – developing new features at breakneck speed, it was hard to imagine that this unheard-of large language model (LLM), even one that looked impressive on paper, and was fundamentally different in many ways, could rock the boat. But that all changed overnight on January 27, 2025 – as China woke up on the day before Lunar New Year's Eve, DeepSeek had become the #1 app in the AI/GPT world and decimated the stock price of the who's who of the industry: As well as Nvidia and OpenAi, scalps included Meta, Google's parent company Alphabet, Nvidia partners Oracle, plus many other energy and data center firms. Elon Musk dodged this bullet – only because X is no longer listed on the market. While the market downturn is no doubt a temporary one, DeepSeek has permanently altered the path of the AI timeline. Until now, the US has been so far ahead in the field that all we really expected to see were poor imitations of the 'gold standard' models. And this is why DeepSeek is so interesting, because it's forged its own path, setting up China as a new player in what some are now calling a digital arms race. What makes it so different are a number of things: It's been trained on older, cheaper chips and cut out a few of the costly steps that has, until now, been the standard route for chatbots. Because of this, its development cost a reported US$5.6 million to rent the hardware required for training the model, compared with an estimated $60 million for Llama 3.1 405B, which also used 11 times the computing resources. GPT-4 cost more than $100 million. Microsoft has also said it plans to spend $80 billion on AI development in 2025. R1 is also open source, rather than closely guarded proprietary, which in turn helps DeepSeek navigate regional restrictions. Overall, this has triggered a kind of existential crisis for the US-dominated industry – because what if a model could be produced for a fraction of the cost, and trained more efficiently, and be just as good, if not better? "There are a few things to know about this one," said Casey Newton, one of the hosts of the Hard Fork podcast on January 10. "One is that it's really big; it has more than 680 billion parameters, which makes it significantly bigger than the largest model in Meta's Llama series, which I would say up to this point has been the gold standard for open models. That one has 405 billion parameters. "But the really, really important thing about DeepSeek is that it was trained at a cost of US$5.5 million," he continued. "And so what that means is you now have an LLM that is about as good as the state-of-the-art [AIs] that was trained for a tiny fraction of what something like Llama or ChatGPT was trained for." To understand why DeepSeek is so significant, you have to look at where it came from. Its developer, quantitive – or quant – trader Liang Wenfung bought up thousands of Nvidia chips back in 2021 to work on a 'side project' to assist with his day job at the helm of one of the Chinese market's largest hedge-fund companies, High-Flyer. The 40-year-old financier used these chips to build algorithms and mathematical models to help predict market trends and steer investments, with DeepSeek only established in 2023. “When we first met him, he was this very nerdy guy with a terrible hairstyle talking about building a 10,000-chip cluster to train his own models," one of Liang’s business partners told the Financial Times. "We didn’t take him seriously. He couldn’t articulate his vision other than saying: ‘I want to build this, and it will be a game changer.’ We thought this was only possible from giants like ByteDance and Alibaba.” Less than two years on, the maker of those chips – Nvidia – would see $593 billion wiped from its market value overnight thanks to Wenfung. It's now the biggest daily loss in US market history. (Incidentally, export of advanced Nvidia chips has now been restricted – yet DeepSeek-V3 was trained on cheaper, older Nvidia H800 hardware.) What makes DeepSeek's R1 model such a game-changer is its unorthodox training (and, in turn, the money saved in the process). This fantastic explainer covers a recent research paper released by the company, which essentially details how DeepSeek bypassed the traditional supervised fine-tuning stage of LLM development and instead focused on the AI's "self-evolution through a pure reinforcement learning process." “We demonstrate that reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through large-scale reinforcement learning (RL), even without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a cold start," the DeepSeek researchers wrote in the January paper. "Furthermore, performance can be further enhanced with the inclusion of a small amount of cold-start data." While this is unlikely to rock the world of LLM users, who are most likely casually interacting with the likes of Google's Gemini or Anthropic's Claude, it stands as a defining moment in the development of this technology. Which brings us to another aspect of its business model that sets it apart – and has the industry rattled: Access. As Nature's Elizabeth Gibney wrote about on January 23. DeepSeek-R1 is released as "open weight," which means it can be used as a tool for researchers to study and build on. In comparison, existing market-leading models are what researchers deem a "black box," a closed-off system controlled instead by the developers. It paves the way for scientists to harness an existing model for their own uses, rather than build from the ground up. "DeepSeek hasn’t released the full cost of training R1, but it is charging people using its interface around one-30th of what [Open AI's] o1 costs to run," Gibney noted. "The firm has also created mini ‘distilled’ versions of R1 to allow researchers with limited computing power to play with the model." However, as DeepSeek triggered the market crash on January 27, it was met with cyberattackers attempting to crash its servers. "Due to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek's services, we are temporarily limiting registrations to ensure continued service," the company posted on its status page. "Existing users can log in as usual. Thanks for your understanding and support." As of writing, DeepSeek-R1 can still be downloaded and the site accessed, but new registrations are restricted to China residents with a local phone number. Meanwhile, a somewhat inevitable backlash is now under way, with countless news outlets including Forbes noting that DeepSeek-R1 is hampered by censorship, stonewalling questions that would evoke criticism of China. Silicon Valley startup Perplexity AI – which currently has its sights on a US merger deal with TikTok's parent company ByteDance – was briefly hosting an "uncensored" search engine powered by DeepSeek-R1, but this too has been taken offline. Regardless of how this plays out in the coming days and weeks, one thing is certain: DeepSeek, in a few short weeks, has singlehandedly shifted the course of AI development. “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution," said Professor Geoff Webb, from the Department of Data Science & AI at Monash University in Australia. "Until now it has seemed that billion-dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialized Nvidia processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems. This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. He adds that if DeepSeek's claims are all true, "it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems." Webb then makes an important point that few people are talking about: The monopolization of AI by a handful of powerful players in the US – further consolidated by government-legislated export restrictions on crucial Nvidia hardware – essentially denies the rest of the world a stake in the most significant technological advancement since the internet. “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture," he added. "This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems. “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.”

Title: Analysis:US tech stock tumble highlights risk of market reliance on megacaps

Business Traders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., December 10, 2024. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo NEW YORK : Turbulence in some of the biggest tech names is reminding investors of one of the major risks to the U.S. stock market's record-setting rally: Reliance on a handful of mammoth companies to power those gains. Investors are scrambling to understand the fallout for the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme that has been a critical driver for stocks over the past two years after the emergence of a low-cost Chinese AI model rattled markets. Optimism over AI has helped propel shares of chipmaker Nvidia and others of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps, which combined contributed more than half of the S&P 500's 25 per cent total return in 2024. Because of those gains, the Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the weight of the benchmark S&P 500 and about 45 per cent of the Nasdaq 100 - meaning when they falter they have outsized impact on the closely followed market barometers. "You run the risk when you have concentration that you have selloffs like this," said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services. "It's certainly going to raise questions in terms of how investors are positioning portfolios." The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday after news of the DeepSeek AI model - cutting the index's year-to-date gain nearly by half - while the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 sank 3 per cent. While it is uncertain "how big a threat DeepSeek itself will be to the AI theme," said Phillip Wool, chief research officer and lead portfolio manager at Rayliant Global Advisors, "it's crystal-clear that there are a bunch of correlated and crowded trades at risk when the tide of sentiment turns." Shares of Nvidia, the AI poster child whose stunning stock-price rise had propelled it to become the largest company by market value, tumbled 17 per cent on Monday. Seth Hickle, managing partner at Mindset Wealth Management, said he moved to position more defensively with Nvidia options amid the volatility following the DeepSeek news. Nvidia "is really widely held," Hickle said. "So this really affects all Americans who have a retirement portfolio or a passive equity investment strategy." Just last week President Donald Trump's announcement of private sector investment in AI infrastructure gave a lift to tech stocks and the broader market. Analysts at Capital Economics said that if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, "there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the U.S. stock market." "That’s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally," the Capital Economics analysts said in a note. INFLECTION POINT? Investing in broad market funds that follow the S&P 500 has been a winning bet for the past two years, with the benchmark index posting back-to-back annual gains of over 20 per cent. Many actively managed funds have been underweight the major tech stocks, which was a headwind for the funds' performance. But the increasing megacap stock concentration in the benchmarks "means that we cannot all be very passively invested as we have been over the last decade," said Shams Afzal, managing director and portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel. Some corners of tech were benefiting on Monday as investors assessed the DeepSeek implications, with shares of cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks and software company ServiceNow both up about 1 per cent. The DeepSeek news "could lead to some relative leadership shift, which could be other parts of tech, as opposed to just Nvidia," said Tiffany Wade, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. Horizon's Carlson and others wondered if Monday's AI developments could be an "inflection point" that prompts a change in market leadership or a rotation into other corners of the U.S. market that have not fared as well in recent years. To be sure, many market participants said the stock selloff could be an overreaction as investors "shoot first and ask questions later" as they sort out the DeepSeek developments. Josh Pantony, co-founder and CEO of Boosted.ai, a firm that advises asset managers on how to deploy AI, said he is adding AI-related stocks to his personal portfolio “right, left and center” in the wake of the selloff. The market will be further tested by a slew of quarterly results this week, including from Apple, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Tesla - four of the Magnificent Seven. David Wagner, head of equities and portfolio manager at Aptus Capital Advisors LLC, said the megacap companies exhibit operating leverage, which can continue to drive operating margin expansion. "No matter how you slice it, the U.S. market is dependent on these stocks, but that's not always a bad thing," Wagner said.

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 27, 2025 at 10:50 PM Updated: January 28, 2025 at 5:31 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Rebounding tech stocks drove U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 climbed 0.9% to claw back more than half of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 2% after sliding 3.1 % the day before. Recommended Videos The spotlight remained on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 8.8% after plunging nearly 17% the day before, which was its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy picked up 1.4% after plummeting nearly 21% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are threatened after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at a fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations that big spending will only continue to grow. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It’s still uncertain how much DeepSeek’s development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending than expected for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software,” according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. “We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost a quarter of its value, 25.7%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. All told, the S&P 500 rose 55.42 points to 6,067.70. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 136.77 to 44,850.35, and the Nasdaq composite rallied 391.75 to 19,733.59. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury remained at 4.53%, where it was late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn’t as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to give the economy a boost since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji’s stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Asian shares are trading mixed after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy TOKYO -- Asian shares were mixed in thin Lunar New Year trading on Tuesday after Wall Street’s tech superstars tumbled as a competitor from China raised doubts over the recent artificial-intelligence market frenzy. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 lost 1.5% to 38,959.05. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was little changed, inching down 0.1% to 8,399.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.1% to 20,225.11. Markets in South Korea, Shanghai markets and other parts of the region were closed for holidays. Among technology companies in Japan, SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, plunging 6%. Hitachi Ltd. lost 7%, but Fujitsu and Sony Corp. recovered. Computer chip maker Tokyo Electron sank 5.5%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 1% after a marathon news conference overnight by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji's stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. On Monday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.5% to 6,012.28, dragged down in large part by a 16.9% fall for Nvidia. Other Big Tech stocks also took heavy losses, pulling the Nasdaq composite down 3.1% to 19,341.83 for its worst loss in more than a month. The damage was focused on AI-related stocks, while the rest of the market held up much better. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.7% to 44,713.58, and the majority of U.S. stocks climbed. But anyone holding an S&P 500 index fund, which are found in many 401(k) accounts, felt the pain because of how influential those tech giants have become on indexes. The shock to financial markets came from China, where an AI company called DeepSeek unveiled a large language model that can compete with U.S. giants but at potentially a fraction of the cost. DeepSeek had already hit the top of the chart for free apps on Apple’s App Store by Monday morning, and analysts said such a feat was particularly impressive given how the U.S. government has restricted Chinese access to top AI chips. It's unclear, however, how much DeepSeek’s announcement will ultimately shake the economy that’s built around the AI industry, from the chip makers making semiconductors to the utilities hoping to electrify vast data centers gobbling up computing power. “It remains to be seen if DeepSeek found a way to work around these chip restrictions rules and what chips they ultimately used as there will be many skeptics around this issue given the information is coming from China,” according to Dan Ives, an analyst with Wedbush Securities. DeepSeek’s disruption nevertheless rocked AI-related stocks worldwide. It’s a sharp turnaround for the AI winners, which had soared in recent years on hopes that all the investment pouring in would remake the global economy and deliver gargantuan profits along the way. Such stellar performances also raised criticism that their stock prices had gone too far, too fast. Before Monday’s drop, which was its worst since the 2020 COVID crash, Nvidia’s stock had soared from less than $20 to more than $140 in less than two years, for example. A small group of seven such companies has become so dominant that they alone accounted for more than half the S&P 500’s total return last year, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. They include Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. Their immense sizes give them huge sway over the S&P 500 and other indexes that give more weight to bigger companies. Markets are also awaiting earnings reports later this week from Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude added 36 cents to $73.53 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 42 cents to $77.50 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar rose to 155.71 Japanese yen from 154.51 yen. The euro cost $1.0441, down from $1.0493. ___ AP Business Writer Stan Choe contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Rebounding tech stocks are driving U.S. indexes higher Tuesday, a day after they tumbled on doubts about whether the artificial-intelligence frenzy really needs all the dollars being poured into it. The S&P 500 was 1% higher in late trading and clawing back nearly two-thirds of its earlier drop. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 152 points, or 0.3%, with a little less than an hour remaining in trading, and the Nasdaq composite was 2% higher after sliding 3.1 % the day before. The spotlight remains on Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the move into AI and whose stock has become a symbol of the surrounding frenzy. It rose 7.2% after plunging nearly 17% from the day before, its worst drop since the 2020 COVID crash. Other AI-related companies also held steadier, including chip company Broadcom, which rose 2.6%. Constellation Energy edged down 0.1%, but that was much milder than its plummet of 20.8% on Monday. It had earlier rallied on expectations it will help supply the electricity that vast AI data centers would gobble up. Such revenues are under threat after DeepSeek, a Chinese company, said it was able to develop a large language model that can perform as well as big U.S. rivals but at fraction of the cost. That raises questions about whether all the spending expected for AI chips and electricity will need to happen. AI-related stocks have been Wall Street’s biggest stars in recent years, soaring on expectations for big continued spending. The gains, though, also created criticism that the stock prices had simply gone too high, too fast. It's still uncertain how much DeepSeek's development will upend the AI industry. While it could mean less growth in spending for data centers, electricity and chips, it could also boost other areas. “If AI becomes less expensive to use, we think businesses will adopt it more quickly, making a greater investment in AI software," according to James Egelhof, chief U.S. economist at BNP Paribas. "We think this acceleration in adoption could mean a rise in software investment that offsets – or even dwarfs – any deceleration in spending on data center structures, hardware and related investment.” Outside of AI-related industries, stocks held up fairly well on Monday, and they were mixed Tuesday following a set of mixed profit reports. Royal Caribbean steamed 12.5% higher after the cruise operator topped analysts’ profit expectations for the end of 2024. It benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from customers booking trips closer to the time of departure. The company also gave a profit forecast for the first three months of 2025 that topped analysts’ expectations. JetBlue Airways, meanwhile, lost more than a quarter of its value, 27.3%, despite reporting a milder loss for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The company said it expects its costs outside of fuel to rise more quickly at the start of 2025 than a key underlying measure of its revenue. Later this week will come profit reports from some of Wall Street’s most influential companies, including Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Tesla. In the bond market, which had been driving much of Wall Street’s action before Monday’s upheaval, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged up to 4.54% from 4.53% late Monday. It’s been climbing in recent months as traders pared back expectations for how many cuts the Federal Reserve will deliver to short-term interest rates this year. The U.S. economy remains solid, and worries are high that tariffs and other policies potentially coming from President Donald Trump could put upward pressure on inflation. A report showing confidence among U.S. consumers wasn't as strong as economists expected made relatively small waves in the bond market. The more anticipated event will come on Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve will announce its latest decision on interest rates. The widespread expectation is that it will leave the federal funds rate alone. If that proves true, it would be the first meeting where the Fed did not cut rates to help the economy since it began doing so in September. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed across Europe and Asia. Japan’s Nikkei 225 lost 1.4% as SoftBank Group Corp. stock extended its losses, sinking 5.2%. Fuji Media Holdings, rocked by a sex scandal, rose 3% after a marathon news conference by its top executives that lasted more than 10 hours, in which two of them resigned to take responsibility for the scandal. Fuji’s stock price has zigzagged in recent months amid Japanese magazine reports about “a problem” involving an anchorwoman and a Japanese male star. He has subsequently announced his retirement. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: New Zealand Superannuation Fund takes DeepSeek hit

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. We’re all a little poorer after Nvidia’s 17% dive on Tuesday (the stock had stabilised in early Wednesday NZT trading). The Nasdaq-listed chipmaker’s stock took a battering on fears that China’s low-cost DeepSeek AI heralds a new era of artificial intelligence (AI) that takes less computer grunt to train; essentially, fewer of Nvidia’s expensive chips. The promise is ChatGPT-level results (as long as you don’t ask it about Tiananmen Square) on a Temu budget. Software makers incorporate DeepSeek into their own apps at no cost. A ton of people have also tried DeepSeek for themselves over the past few days, pushing it to number one on Apple and Google’s app stores. It looks and feels a lot like ChatGPT, if you use that on your phone. You can also access DeepSeek via the web. “A little-known Chinese hedge fund has thrown a grenade into the world of artificial intelligence with a large language model that, in effect, matches the market leader, Sam Altman’s OpenAI, at a fraction of the cost. And while OpenAI treats its models’ workings as proprietary, DeepSeek’s R1 wears its technical innards on the outside, making it attractive for developers to use and build on,” says the Financial Times’ Lex. ”On the outside” is a reference to DeepSeek’s “open-source” model. Essentially that means software developers can access it for free and then tweak it to their own ends at low cost. The rise of the apparently much more computing-efficient DeepSeek could also lead to questions over “StarGate” – a AI infrastructure initiative co-announced by OpenAI, Oracle and Softbank in the Oval Office last week as Donald Trump looked on. The new President’s administration won’t chip in any funds toward the US$100 billion ($176b) to US$500b project, but has made loosely defined promises to clear red tape. Nvidia was coming off an epic bull run that had seen it become the single biggest equity holding in the New Zealand Superannuation Fund’s $81.6b portfolio. Many growth KiwiSaver funds have also been heavy on the stock. The AI feeding frenzy saw Nvidia’s stock gain 171% last year and kept powering upwards into early January, consolidating its position as the world’s most valuable company. But today’s rout wiped US$590b ($1.03 trillion) from Nvidia’s market value – the biggest one-day hit in Wall Street history, at least in non-inflation-adjusted dollar terms. Nvidia’s market cap fell to US$2.9t, pushing it into third place behind Apple and Microsoft. In its most recent portfolio disclosure (June 2024), the NZ Super Fund said it owned 7,856,082 Nvidia shares – which would have been worth around $2.09b on Friday and $355 million less today. The question now is whether DeepSeek has triggered the start of a months-long correction in the price of AI-related stocks and tech stocks in general – or whether the deep freakout over DeepSeek will dissipate overnight (which it seems has been the case from early Wednesday trading). The Wall Street Journal and others have noted that, so far, there’s little hard evidence of DeepSeek’s vaunted ability to be trained at ultra-low cost, using fewer chips and the geek set is arguing over whether it’s truly open source. And many are dubious that DeepSeek took just US$5.5m to develop as its makers claim, even if sanctions mean it was likely trained on cheaper, lower-grade Nvidia chips. But against that, many have seen AI stocks as being in a bubble (Nvidia is doing extremely well – its net profit increased 16% over the past quarter and 109% year-on-year to US$19.31b in the three months to October 27, 2024 – but arguably not US$3t worth of well in a world where AI faces potential energy constraints). Investors can’t spread their bets by buying into DeepSeek; it’s owned by a Chinese hedge fund called High Flyer. The NZ Super Fund – and Big Tech-heavy KiwiSaver growth funds – will be keeping a wary eye on the other members of the so-called Magnificent Seven, where the news was mixed today. Google parent Alphabet was down 4.0%. Microsoft – the major backer of ChatGPT maker OpenA – was down 2.1%. Tesla was down 2.3%. (While CEO Elon Musk has talked up the potential of AI to drive growth at the EV maker – particularly with coming robo-taxis – its recent fall away has been more tied to Trump’s executive order calling for an end to EV subsidies, or at least discussion on that point). Shares in Amazon – which has a major stake in AI firm Anthropic, maker of the Claude generative AI – were flat. Claude could take a hit from DeepSeek, but the generative AI forms a relatively small part of the tech giant’s business. Apple actually climbed 3.3%. Some analysts saw DeepSeek’s emergence as a validation of Apple’s decision to develop its own chips in-house to power its Apple Intelligence. Meta shares were also in the green. The owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and the developer of the open-source Llama large language model was up 1.9%. Some have seen the company overspending on AI development. Its CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post on Friday his firm would spend as much as US$60b to US$65b on AI this year as it builds a massive new data centre and develops a new version of Llama. Analysts said DeepSeek illustrated that AI could be developed on a more cost-effective basis. In its most recent portfolio disclosure, the NZ Super Fund had 2,216,984 shares in Microsoft worth $1.63b; 4,512,851 shares in Apple worth $1.56b; 3,280,616 shares in Alphabet worth $984m; 2,491,984 shares in Amazon worth $790m; 640,325 shares in Meta, worth $529m; and 687084 shares in Tesla worth $223m.

Title: Nvidia calls China’s DeepSeek R1 model ‘an excellent AI advancement’: Breakthrough creates more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 5:44:32 PM PST by SeekAndFind Nvidia called DeepSeek’s R1 model “an excellent AI advancement,” despite the Chinese startup’s emergence causing the chip maker’s stock price to plunge 17% on Monday. “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling,” an Nvidia spokesperson told CNBC on Monday. “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant.” The comments come after DeepSeek last week released R1, which is an open-source reasoning model that reportedly outperformed the best models from U.S. companies such as OpenAI. R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market. Analysts are now asking if multi-billion dollar capital investments from companies like Microsoft , Google and Meta for Nvidia-based AI infrastructure are being wasted when the same results can be achieved more cheaply. Earlier this month, Microsoft said it is spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week said the social media company planned to invest between $60 to $65 billion in capital expenditures (Excerpt) Read more at cnbc.com ...

R1′s self-reported training cost was less than $6 million, which is a fraction of the billions that Silicon Valley companies are spending to build their artificial-intelligence models. Nvidia’s statement indicates that it sees DeepSeek’s breakthrough as creating more work for the American chip maker’s graphics processing units, or GPUs. “Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” the spokesperson added. “We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Nvidia also said that the GPUs that DeepSeek used were fully export compliant. That counters Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang’s comments on CNBC last week that he believed DeepSeek used Nvidia GPUs models which are banned in mainland China. DeepSeek says it used special versions of Nvidia’s GPUs intended for the Chinese market.

Dave Plummer says he can run it on his box with a threadripper and it works fine.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3TpcHebtxM Nvidia’s defensiveness on the export controls makes me believe even more firmly that China easily imported all the banned graphics cards they needed to train deepseek. Wang is correct. They used H100s. Jevon’s paradox. Now that it’s cheaper, demand will expand. This whole “run locally” thing confuses me. Is that saying that DeepSeek can operate without making calls outside the device? That it will run effectively on a machine that has no connection to the outside world?

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana - PMAY (Urban) - has made steady progress since it was announced in mid-2015. Data by Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs indicates 118.64 lakh homes have been sanctioned as of 20th January 2025. Nearly 90.22 lakh units have been completed, and nearly 112.50 lakh have been ‘grounded’. In terms of the financials, nearly INR 200,000 Cr of central assistance has already been committed. Despite fairly good progress, PMAY must be made accessible to more people, and awareness about it also needs a big shot in the arm. New adaptable, sustainable and low-cost construction technologies can be used to rapidly develop large mass housing projects. The government should also try to eliminate bottlenecks in property records. An important aspect of PMAY is interest subsidy on home loans, and direct subsidy for individual house construction or enhancement. However, to qualify for these subsidies, properties need title documents - a big hurdle, since India’s land records system is far from sophisticated enough right now to address the task holistically and at scale. Any announcements that Union Budget 2025-26 will make in context with affordable housing will doubtlessly involve PMAY. Creative solutions and strong political will can bring this vitally important programme back to centre stage, which is where it belongs. Nationally, rising prices have led to a gradual tapering down of luxury housing, and this may trigger an inflection point where the cycle can once again turn positive for the affordable segment. Any substantial announcement for the affordable housing segment in the upcoming Union Budget can strengthen the trend and give affordable housing a seriously needed leg-up. The Government is expected to walk a thin line on maintaining the fiscal deficit targets and stimulating the slowing economy with increased infrastructure investments, incentives for job creation and increasing disposable income with the middle class segment. Veloce Fintech, a part of the Lemon Group, had launched its SEBI-registered Category-II Alternative Investment Fund (AIF), the Veloce Opportunities Fund. The fund has crossed ₹140 crores in commitments, including a ₹40 crore green shoe option, aiming for a total target corpus of ₹200 crores, which will be closed in the next few months. Out of the ₹140 crores in commitments, total drawdown & deployment has crossed ₹100 crores. Focused on providing venture debt and pre-IPO funding to MSMEs, the fund aims to bridge the gap between growth capital requirements and structured investment opportunities. Veloce Fintech specializes in connecting ARCs, Real Estate Developers, MSMEs and startups with institutional lenders and investors. The Fund, managed by a team of experts, leveraging their extensive experience and industry insights, strives to drive long term growth for its portfolio companies while generating consistent high returns for the fund investors. Targeting over 20 companies, the Veloce Opportunities Fund seeks businesses with clear growth trajectories, robust governance practices, and scalable models. Using a sector-agnostic approach, it supports enterprises in diverse fields such as manufacturing, technology, real estate, healthcare, and services. The fund targets a return of 18+%. Given its pre-ponderance on debt, regular interest income and quicker cash flows from investments, the fund expects a higher level of consistency in payouts with lower volatility of returns.

Stock traded at ₹1,160.50 on the NSE, down 1.34% Indian equity benchmarks opened higher on Tuesday morning, rebounding from Monday’s sell-off, as the Reserve Bank of India’s liquidity-boosting measures lifted sentiment amid mixed global cues and ongoing concerns about US tech valuations following Chinese AI developments. The Sensex opened higher at 75,659.00 compared to its previous close of 75,366.17 and is currently trading at 75,714.06, up by 347.89 points or 0.46 per cent. Similarly, the Nifty opened at 22,960.45 against its previous close of 22,829.15 and is now at 22,908.75, gaining 79.60 points or 0.35 per cent.

Read more We have been maintaining our bearish stance since the last 2 - 3 months and have been repeatedly advocating against catching the falling knife. Now, since we are about to enter a crucial and major support zone of 22800 - 22400, we would change our stance from bearish to cautious now. From hereon, it would be very difficult to anticipate what the Union Budget has to offer and other global developments, but unless there is any major disappointment from the budget or any other global aberration, markets are likely to see some respite in the mentioned support zone any time soon. This certainly does not mean one should start buying throttle; but yes, accumulation in a staggered manner in the coming days is advisable with no leveraged positions. On the upside, the bearish gap of 23000-23050 is likely to resist any pullbacks ahead of the event, while the formidable obstacle is present around 23350, coinciding with the 20 DEMA. As we look ahead to the week, a plethora of events is set to unfold, each holding the potential to shift market dynamics significantly. Given this landscape of potential developments, it’s essential to remain agile and responsive. The anticipated increase in volatility presents opportunities to capitalize on market movements, whether they trend upward or downward. Staying alert and adaptable will be crucial for navigating the twists and turns that lie ahead. It could possibly be hasty to build in rate cut expectations in the February review as the broader growth inflation mix does not unambiguously call for the same. Having said that, this remains a close call and would clearly involve a subjective call with respect to the timing. Given that liquidity actions have a far direct and sustained impact, which has clearly been done, there is clearly merit in pushing back rate cuts possibly until there is more clarity on the external front as well as evolution of domestic growth inflation mix as well as liquidity conditions over the coming quarters. The April review possibly remains a better bet for the same. In the near term, the union budget should set the tone both for any potential fiscal actions to address consumption demand in the economy and to revive private sector investments.

On the options side, highest Call OI is at 320 strike, while the highest Put OI is at 260 strike for 21 February 2025 expiry. BASE METALS LME and domestic MCX copper tumbled on Monday as market sentiment was dampened by US President Donald Trump’s threat to impose tariffs and sanctions on Colombia. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields extended losses and capped downside on Monday’s session. On the data front, it was overall positive for the Dollar and weighed on gold and silver. Other metals ended weaker on LME and MCX on Monday’s trade.

A recovery in the Dollar Index and Treasury Yields this Tuesday morning could also weigh on the Rupee. Although, a drop in the crude oil prices and possibly a small recovery on the domestic equity markets could cap losses for the Rupee. In the overseas markets, the U.S. Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields eased on Monday. The Dollar Index and the U.S. Treasury Yields has started with gains this early Tuesday morning in Asian trading ahead of the Fed meeting outcome this week.

The Pound/Sterling gained against the Dollar this Monday but started weaker against the Dollar this Tuesday morning trade in Asia, tracking a recovery of the greenback. The Japanese Yen appreciated against the Dollar on Monday on BoJ rate hike revisions, although the Yen started weaker further this Tuesday morning as the dollar rebounded following fresh tariff threats from US President Donald Trump. US benchmarks showed a mix of performances, with both the Nasdaq and S&P 500 registering losses, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) remained positive. The decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 was mainly due to the significant drop in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia, after the introduction of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI assistant that’s much cheaper than its US counterparts, affecting the AI landscape dynamics. Over in Asia, the Nikkei fell as the US tech stock turmoil spread to Japan, and the strengthening yen further dampened market sentiment. Meanwhile, the Hang Seng index stayed nearly flat after starting the day strong. Domestically, markets are expected to open on a positive note, but global sentiments might influence the benchmarks as the day goes on. The IT sector is predicted to remain under pressure due to the developments around DeepSeek and the general weakness in global tech sentiment. The benchmark index started the trading week with continued selling pressure from the prior session, opening 152 points lower and breaching the critical support level around 22976. This set a bearish tone for the day, culminating in a close within the lower quartile of the trading range—marking a panic day as it finished 263 points down from the previous close. This situation has resulted in significantly oversold market conditions, suggesting that the near-term incentive for additional short positions is relatively low, which is a positive development. The area around 22800 now serves as a vital support level, and maintaining a position above it will be essential to garner bullish strength. Yesterday’s trading session saw bearish sentiment dominate Dalal Street, with Nifty closing well below the 23,000 mark. Pessimism persists due to global headwinds, including uncertainty over President Donald Trump’s tariff plans and significant outflows from Foreign Institutional Investors, amounting to Rs. 74,096 crore in January. Wall Street also reacted negatively to reports of Chinese startup DeepSeek’s cost-efficient AI model, posing a challenge to major U.S. tech giants. Key upcoming catalysts include the Federal Open Market Committee’s meeting on January 28-29 and the Union Budget 2025 on February 1st. Stocks in focus include Bajaj Auto, Hindustan Zinc, Hyundai Motors, Cipla, TVS Motors, and Coal India, which reported a 17% decline in Q3 net profit to Rs. 8,505.57 crore. Sell Balkrishna Industries (CMP 2565) in the 2590-2610 zone with a stop at 2727 for targets of 2489/2419. Also, bearish positions are recommended for Jindal Steel & Power, Divis Lab, and Balkrishna Industries on any early intraday strength. From a technical perspective, the market is consistently facing selling pressure at higher levels and is forming lower tops on daily charts, which is negative. Technically, the levels of 23,000 and 23,050 would serve as key resistance areas, while 22800 and 22,750 could act as important support zones. If it falls below 22,750, selling pressure may intensify that could send market to 22600 levels. The strategy should be to reduce weak long positions around 23000-23050 levels, however, during the week if it falls to 22600 then we should look for buying select stocks with a medium to long-term view. Regarding Bank Nifty, as long as it remains below 49000, weak sentiment will likely persist. On the downside, it could decline to the 47,500-47,200 range. However, if it rises above 49,000, there could be a rebound to the 20-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) or up to 49,500. “The DeepSeek impact on the US stock market in general, and the tech stocks in particular, has turned out to be a reality check for the overvalued stock market. In the medium-term this is likely to have a sobering effect on markets, globally. The Indian market appears to be oversold and is set for a rebound. The RBI’s announcement of measures to boost the liquidity in the banking system by around Rs 1.5 trillion is positive for the market. This raises the prospects of a rate cut by the MPC in the February policy meeting. Banks are likely to benefit. After the correction the market is now trading at fair valuations which are in line with long-term (10-year) averages. Investors can utilise the opportunity to buy fundamentally strong high quality stocks. The outperformance of largecaps over mid-and smallcaps is a healthy trend.” 360 ONE’s operating revenue grew 38% YoY and was 7% higher than our estimates, driven by 14% beat in transactional income. Additionally, strong beat in other income resulted in 17% beat in PAT at Rs 270 crore (+42% YoY). 360 ONE’s Board has proposed the acquisition of one of India’s leading brokerage and corporate advisory houses – B&K Securities. The proposed acquisition of B&K will add a new research capability across all platforms of 360 ONE and also provide entry into the IB segment. Since the cost structure of B&K is aligned with 360 ONE, the acquisition will be EPS accretive. We reiterate our BUY rating with a one-year target price of Rs 1,350 Investing in AI may be nothing like as expensive as previously thought. This should accelerate the advancement of the technology. But at the same time it also means that chief financial officers will start to ask questions about the enormous amounts being spent on computing power in the AI arms race. GREED & fear has been concerned that the stock market would at some point this year question all this spending in the continuing absence of clear proof of monetisation. This was, first and foremost, a potential threat to the share prices of the hyperscalers who have been spending the money. But the DeepSeek news will now cause pressure on the AI hardware supply chain on concerns that the likes of Meta will do a U-turn and slash capex spending. The other issue raised by the DeepSeek news is that, while it is clearer than ever that the age of AI is coming, it is also increasingly equally clear that the long fashionable concepts of “moats”, as applied by fund managers to individual companies in the investment world, looks ever more precarious, if not redundant, in the AI world given the monumental scope for disruption. This is highly relevant given the massive market capitalisations represented by Big Tech at a time when these companies have in practice been converging on the same AI area to compete with each other. It seems unlikely in the extreme to GREED & fear that all the current dominant incumbents will prevail in the new world order which emerges. :Indian benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty 50 are likely to open gap up as trend in GIFT Nifty suggest a positive start for the broader index. Asian markets were trading mixed. Nasdaq posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since December18 on Monday as a low-cost Chinese artificial intelligence model prompted a steep selloff in U.S. chipmakers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289.33 points, or 0.65%, to 44,713.58, the S&P 500 lost 88.96 points, or 1.46%, to 6,012.28 and the Nasdaq Composite lost 612.47 points, or 3.07%, to 19,341.83. Spot gold is likely to slip towards $2720 level on strong dollar and rise in US treasury yields. Further, investors will remain cautious ahead of US Federal Reserve monetary policy where central bank is likely to keep its policy unchanged, while all eyes will be on comments to get clarity on future rate path. Additionally, market will try to decode how US President Donald Trump’s policies will impact Fed’s views on growth and inflation. Moreover, expectation of improved economic data from US will hurt prices HDFC Securities has a ‘reduce’ on Indian Oil Corporation with a target price of Rs 124, on margin pressure due to increasing petchem supplies/capacity, lower refining margins, and moderation in auto fuel marketing margins. The oil refiner’s Q3 earnings were affected by weak performance from petchem segment, lower refining margins, inventory loss and absorption of under-recovery on LPG. HDFC Sec said gross refining margin came in lower than estimates at $2.9/bbl, while gross debt rose 24% on year to Rs 1.3 lakh crore. DCB Bank over the last 4-5 quarters consistently grew its loan book and deposits at ~20% on a YoY basis. During the quarter, the Bank reported a strong loan book growth of 23%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis, with the mortgage/AIB segment contributing 45%/24% of the loan book, demonstrating a growth of 6%/3% on a QoQ and 21% each on a YoY basis. Co-lending has played a significant role in the current quarter, contributing to the surge in loan growth from 18-19% to 23% on a YoY basis. NII grew by 15%/7% on a YoY/QoQ basis. NIM was stable on a QoQ basis at ~3.3%. During the quarter, the Bank’s core fee income increased by 49%/2% on a YoY/QoQ basis and costto-income ratio witnessed an improvement of 191/156 bps on a YoY/QoQ basis which led to a PPOP growth of 28%/6% on a YoY/QoQ basis. The Bank is showcasing continuous decline of slippages while the stress on MFI portfolio remained challenging, resulting in higher provisions by 64%/47% on a YoY/QoQ basis. Going forward, management aims to improve NIM, reduce cost-to-income ratio, and achieve an ROA of >1% in FY26. Lower e-auction price as well as minimal volume growth dented revenue, while EBITDA fell 13% YoY to Rs 10400 crore and EBITDA per ton fell to Rs 535 down by Rs 89/ton. Nuvama said it was trimming the coal miner’s FY25 and FY26 EBITDA by 3% and 5% respectively to factor i the lower volume. The stock was more of a dividend play, it said, adding, “We do not see much downside, but prefer to wait for volume growth to re-enter the stock.” Bank Nifty witnessed some outperformance led by index pivotal compared to the broader markets sell off across sectors and stocks to decline by 0.6% for the day. The 100-week average would be at 47,100 levels which is at support while on the higher side resistance would be at 49,200 levels. RSI is trending below the average line, and other key technical indicators are oversold form current levels so a minor pullback cannot be ruled out from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 50,000 strikes while the downside the highest put OI has moved lower to 47,500 for the monthly expiry NIFTY-50 has closed at 7-month lows and now the support would move lower to the monthly pivot of 22,600 from current levels. We expect some sharp volatility in the second half on back of the monthly expiry in the Sensex and Bankex as well as roll over movement in individual sectors and stocks. RSI is oversold on hourly charts and expect some rebound from the lower range to test the average line from current levels. Highest call OI has moved lower to 23,200 strikes while the downside the highest put is at 22,500 for the monthly expiry. Coal India’s 3QFY25 witnessed a decent improvement following the drag seen in 2QFY25 (which was affected by extended monsoon). The e-auction volumes also remained elevated with some increase in e-auction premiums, which supported profitability. - For FY26/FY27, we maintain our estimates and expect volumes to improve, which would boost earnings performance. The e-auction premium is expected to remain stable ahead. - The company’s focus on increasing coal-washer capacity will improve its market share in domestic coking/non-coking coal. Further, management is focusing on coalmine expansions, which would be funded via internal accruals, or COAL might borrow to undertake certain strategic diversification projects, such as RE facilities and coal gasification, et al. - At CMP, the stock is trading at 3.3x FY27E EV/EBITDA. We reiterate our BUY rating with a TP of INR480 (premised on 4.5x on FY27 EV/EBITDA). - COAL remains our top pick in the metals and mining sector Wall Street tumbled on Monday on threat to US tech companies from DeepSeek, an AI competitor in China. Big Tech stocks took the heaviest losses, with Nvidia down 17%, dragging the Nasdaq composite down 3% ACC’s third quarter was characterised by strong volume growth but weak unitary EBITDA, said Nomura, pointing out the duty refund masked a disappointing quarter. Adjusting for this, the EBITDA of Rs 144/ton was down 4 per cent sequentially, making ACC the only major cement producer to report a quarterly decline. Cement volumes grew 20% YoY to 10.7 million ton, above estimates. “We expect higher share of MSA (master supply agreement) volumes. This could also include some portion of Penna (unlisted) or Sanghi volumes,” said the brokerage firm. It said it maintained its ‘reduce’ recommendation and target price of Rs 1920 based on 10x one-year forward EV/EBITDA The short-term outlook is bullish for the Bank of India. The stock began the week on a positive note, surging 6 per cent on Monday. A complex inverted head and shoulder pattern is visible on the daily chart. The neckline support of this pattern is at ₹101. Below this, the broad ₹100-₹97 region is the next strong support.

Title: What is China’s DeepSeek and why is it freaking out the AI world?

Time Published: 2025-01-27T23:48:20Z
Full Content:
Bengaluru - DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up that is just over a year old, has stirred awe and consternation in Silicon Valley after demonstrating breakthrough artificial intelligence (AI) models that offer comparable performance to the worldâs best chatbots at seemingly a fraction of the cost. DeepSeekâs emergence may offer a counterpoint to the belief that the future of AI will require ever-increasing amounts of power and energy to develop. Global technology stocks tumbled as hype around DeepSeekâs innovation snowballed and investors began to digest the implications for its US-based rivals and hardware suppliers. DeepSeek was founded in 2023 by Mr Liang Wenfeng, the chief of AI-driven quant hedge fund High-Flyer. The company develops AI models that are open source, meaning the developer community at large can inspect and improve the software. Its mobile app surged to the top of iPhone download charts in the US after its release in early January.Â The app distinguishes itself from other chatbots like OpenAIâs ChatGPT by articulating its reasoning before delivering a response to a prompt. The company claims its new AI model, R1, offers performance on a par with OpenAIâs latest and has granted licence for individuals interested in developing chatbots using the technology to build on it.Â Though not fully detailed by the company, the cost of training and developing DeepSeekâs models appears to be only a fraction of what is required for OpenAI or Meta Platformsâ best products. The modelâs much-better efficiency puts into question the need for vast expenditures of capital to acquire the latest and most powerful AI accelerators from the likes of Nvidia. That amplifies attention on US export curbs of such advanced semiconductors to China, which were intended to prevent a breakthrough of the sort that DeepSeek appears to represent. DeepSeek says R1 is near or better than rival models in several leading benchmarks such as AIME 2024 for mathematical tasks: MMLU for general knowledge and AlpacaEval 2.0 for question-and-answer performance. It ranks among the top performers on a UC Berkeley-affiliated leaderboard called Chatbot Arena. Washington has banned the export of high-end technologies like GPU semiconductors to China, in a bid to stall the countryâs advances in AI, the key frontier in the US-China contest for tech supremacy. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have worked their way around the restrictions, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. While it is unclear how much advanced AI-training hardware DeepSeek has had access to, the company has showed enough to suggest the trade restrictions have not been entirely effective in stymieing the countryâs progress. The AI developer has been closely watched since the release of its earliest model in 2023. It gave the world a glimpse of its DeepSeek R1 model, designed to mimic human thinking. That model underpins its mobile chatbot app, which together with the web interface in January became known as a much cheaper OpenAI alternative, with investor Marc Andreessen calling it âAIâs Sputnik momentâ. OpenAI chief executive officer Sam Altman said on X: âDeepSeekâs R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what theyâre able to deliver for the price.â The DeepSeek mobile app was downloaded 1.6 million times by Jan 25 and ranked No. 1 in iPhone app stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the US and Britain, according to market tracker App Figures. Born in Guangdong in 1985, Mr Liang received bachelorâs and mastersâ degrees in electronic and information engineering from Zhejiang University. He founded DeepSeek in 2023 with 10 million yuan (S$1.9 million) in registered capital, according to company database Tianyancha. The bottleneck for further advances is not more fund-raising, he told Chinese media outlet 36kr, but US restrictions on access to the best chips. Most of his top researchers were fresh graduates from top Chinese universities, he said, stressing the need for China to develop its own domestic ecosystem.Â âMore investment does not necessarily lead to more innovation. Otherwise, large companies would take over all innovation,â Mr Liang said. Chinaâs technology leaders, from Alibaba Group Holding and Baidu to Tencent Holdings, have poured significant money and resources into the race to acquire hardware and customers for their AI ventures. Alongside chief executive Kai-Fu Leeâs 01.AI start-up, DeepSeek stands out with its open-source approach â which is designed to recruit the largest number of users quickly before developing monetisation strategies. Because DeepSeekâs models are more affordable, it has played a role in helping to drive down costs for AI developers in China, where the bigger players have engaged in a price war that has seen successive waves of price cuts over the past 1Â½ years. DeepSeekâs success may push OpenAI and US providers to lower pricing to maintain their established lead. It calls into question the vast spending by companies like Meta and Microsoft â each of which has committed to capital expenditure of US$65 billion (S$87.7 billion) or more this year, largely on AI infrastructure â if more efficient models can also compete with a much smaller outlay.Â That roiled global stock markets as investors sold off companies like Nvidia and ASML Holding that have benefited from booming demand for AI services. Shares in Chinese names linked to DeepSeek, such as Iflytek, climbed. Developers around the world are already experimenting with DeepSeekâs software to build tools with it. That could quicken the adoption of advanced AI reasoning models â while potentially touching off additional concern about the need for guardrails around their use. DeepSeekâs advances may hasten regulation to control how AI is developed.Â Like all other Chinese AI models, DeepSeek self-censors on topics deemed sensitive in China. It deflects queries about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests or geopolitically fraught questions such as the possibility of China invading Taiwan. In tests, the DeepSeek bot is capable of giving detailed responses about political figures like Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, but declines to do so about Chinese President Xi Jinping. DeepSeekâs cloud infrastructure is likely to be tested by its sudden popularity. It also briefly experienced a major outage on Jan 27 and will have to manage even more traffic as new and returning users pour more queries into its chatbot.Â BLOOMBERG JoinÂ ST's Telegram channelÂ and get the latest breaking news delivered to you.

Title: Nvidia sheds $792 billion of market value in DeepSeek rout, biggest one-day loss in US history

NEW YORK - Nvidiaâs share plunge, fuelled by investor concern about Chinese artificial-intelligence (AI) start-up DeepSeek, erased a record amount of stock-market value from the worldâs largest company.Â Nvidiaâs shares tumbled 17 per cent on Jan 27, erasing US$589 billion (S$792 billion) from the companyâs market capitalisation. That eclipsed the previous record â a 9 per cent drop in September that wiped out about US$279 billion in value â and was the biggest in US stock-market history. The drop rippled through the rest of the market due to how much weight Nvidia has in major indexes. Including Jan 27âs slump, Nvidia sell-offs have caused eight of the top 10 biggest one-day drops in the S&P 500 Index, based on market value, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Jan 27 and the Nasdaq 100 tumbled nearly 3 per cent. The semiconductor maker led a broader sell-off in technology stocks after DeepSeekâs low-cost approach reignited concerns that big US companies have poured too much money into developing AI. The Chinese firm appears to provide a comparable performance at a fraction of the price.Â The latest AI model of DeepSeek, released last week, is widely seen as competitive with those of ChatGPTâs OpenAI and Facebookâs Meta Platforms. The open-sourced product was founded by quant-fund chief Liang Wenfeng and is now at the top of Appleâs App Store rankings. Â âConcerns have immediately emerged that it could be a disruptor to the current AI business model, which relies on high end chips and extensive computing power and hence energy,â Jefferies analysts said in a note to clients. Nvidia has been the biggest beneficiary of the influx in spending on AI because it designs semiconductors used in the technology. While that heavy spending looks poised to continue, investors may grow wary of rewarding companies that are not showing a sufficient return on the investment. Meta announced plans on Jan 24 to boost capital expenditures on AI projects this year by about half to as much as US$65 billion, sending its shares to a record high. That came on the heels of OpenAI, SoftBank Group and Oracle announcing a US$100 billion joint venture called Stargate to build out data centres and AI infrastructure projects around the United States. In a bid to stall Chinaâs progress in AI, the US has banned the export of advanced semiconductor technologies to the country and is limiting sales of advanced Nvidia AI chips to others. But DeepSeekâs progress suggests Chinese AI engineers have found a way to work around the export bans, focusing on greater efficiency with limited resources. Nvidia said in a statement on Jan 27 that DeepSeekâs model is an âexcellent AI advancementâ and indicated that the Chinese company did not violate US restrictions that limit access to advanced US chips in creating its technology. It also added that inference, or the work of running AI models, ârequires significant numbers of Nvidia GPUs and high-performance networkingâ.

Title: Deepseek Announcement Sinks The American Tech Market

Horizontal color image of a data center from a drone point of view. Amid a free-ranging route of U.S. tech stocks, investors are wondering how the new announcement from Chinese firm DeepSeek, of a new efficient reasoning model to be reckoned with, is going to affect the industry long-term. It’s not just investors, either – the big question for many people looking at the global race for AI is whether DeepSeek’s result really will deliver a great reasoning model for a lot lower cost than its American competitors. In the past few cycles, the world saw double-digit losses for Nvidia, and other negative action, like Palantir dipping 6%, that’s making the bulls nervous. We’ve even seen other kinds of U.S. stocks like nuclear stocks tanking on the premise that America might be spending less on dominating AI and data center markets in the future. "DeepSeek has taken the market by storm by doing more with less," said Giuseppe Sette, president at AI market research firm Reflexivity, as reported by Aimee Picchi at CBS News. "This shows that with AI the surprises will keep on coming in the next few years." But it’s worth thinking a little more long-term about this, since we’re likely to have a pretty big global market for AI in the years to come. People are referring to the DeepSeek announcement as America’s “Sputnik moment” for the AI age, when U.S. parties had a right to be spooked. However, others are asking whether the proof is in the pudding, and whether DeepSeek really does have an advanced edge over the American systems. A team of writers at Bloomberg reported: “(Some) investors, like Fares Hendi at French asset manager Prevoir AM, say they’re holding onto their Nvidia shares and waiting for more information about DeepSeek’s technological promise.” “If they really need less chips to make their model run, then yes the threat is real, it would weigh on growth and valuation,” Hendi said, as reported in Bloomberg. “But at the moment, we’re going to take the time to really look into it.” Then, too, some who were quoted suggested the news might be good for AI, in the long-term and from a big-picture perspective: “It would seem to me that if you still believe that AI is going to be big, this news out of China should only make you feel better… and perhaps present you with some buying opportunities,” said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean that there won’t be bumps or risks (as price seeking continues). But it should be clear that there are some stocks that will be down this morning for the wrong reasons.” Financial pros weighed in on the phenomenon, too. “It’s safe to say that anything US-AI related was very crowded and anything tech-related in China was very under owned,” explains Chris Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna International Group. “So you are going to see a bit of a unwind of those two different crowded sides. It’ll be interesting to see if the options market picks some winners and losers.” Over the past few years, we’ve seen OpenAI and Anthropic and others continue to develop advanced reasoning systems in a way that suggested America was going to be king of the AI world for the duration. But people close to the industry knew that China had its own research teams and systems that were likely to give other nations a run for their money. Time will tell how much fire power DeepSeek has and whether it will continue to depress the American technology sector in the stock market. Another argument emerges that China and the U.S. can both reign supreme in their own hemispheres, in terms of AI systems. Some of the above quotes hint at that, too. Of course, there’s always going to be one particular model that’s better than any others, but there’s also room for customization and specialization in these systems. It’s one thing to concede that stocks like Nvidia, which had wildly spiraled up based on U.S. dominance predictions, is going to keep its high valuation, but it’s another thing to wonder whether China will have an outside influence on American AI systems. Like anything related to the lightning-speed transformation of LLMs in business, the U.S./China divide is going to take some time to figure out. When the dust clears, what will we see? One Community.
