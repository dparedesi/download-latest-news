UPDATED 21:00 EST / NOVEMBER 20 2025 by Mike Wheatley Robotics software startup Physical Intelligence has reportedly closed on a fresh, $600 million round of funding that brings its valuation to a lofty $5.6 billion. The company has not officially disclosed the latest round, but reports by The Information and Bloomberg cited undisclosed sources who are familiar with the matter on the details. Those sources said CapitalG, an independent growth fund operated by Alphabet Inc., led the round, with existing investors Lux Capital, Thrive Capital and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos all returning to throw more capital at the startup. New investors Index Ventures and T. Rowe Price also participated in the round, the sources said. The startup was founded in 2024 by former Google DeepMind researchers and academics from Stanford University and the University of California at Berkeley. It’s developing artificial intelligence algorithms that can act as the “brains” of robots. The company, which is led by Chief Executive Karol Hausman, says it’s building a “general intelligence” system that will eventually be able to power any kind of robot for any kind of application. Robotics AI is a completely different kettle of fish from AI for chatbots such as ChatGPT. Because robots operate in the real world, they need to be able to learn not only from text, but also from other modalities, especially visual data, so they can perceive the physical environment they operate in and make decisions and take actions based on those inputs. Physical Intelligence has not yet announced any product or service, but Bloomberg said the company has been testing its AI software on robotic arms, performing tasks such as folding clothes, assembling boxes and making coffee. Earlier this week, the company released a new vision AI model based on reinforcement learning – a technique that enables models to improve over time as they learn from their experiences. The startup has shared a video of its robotic arms in action on X, saying that the reinforcement learning technique has helped it to double its overall throughput, or the number of tasks it can complete per hour. Our model can now learn from its own experience with RL! Our new π*0.6 model can more than double throughput over a base model trained without RL, and can perform real-world tasks: making espresso drinks, folding diverse laundry, and assembling boxes. More in the thread below. pic.twitter.com/XN1VFYQey1 — Physical Intelligence (@physical_int) November 18, 2025 In testing, Physical Intelligence said the machines were put to work for three hours, and were able to complete each task in an average of three minutes. To develop its models, the startup has spent a lot of money on gathering real-world data that’s used for training purposes. A year ago, when it raised $400 million in funding, the company said one of the biggest challenges it faces is getting enough large-scale multitask and multirobot data to train its models, and its experiments allow it to generate valuable data itself. The startup says existing robots tend to be inflexible, because they’re designed to perform only one particular task in a specific environment. They can work around small changes in their environments but can’t adapt easily to extremely messy or complex spaces such as homes or other real-world places. Physical Intelligence’s goal is to change that, using general intelligence to enable robots to learn and become acclimatized to any environment and task. The startup is not alone in thinking that AI can be used to create much more capable robots. Google LLC is also focused on robotic intelligence through its subsidiary Intrinsic, which just yesterday announced its partnering with Foxconn on a smart factory initiative. Meta Platforms Inc. is also developing AI for robots, and this week announced its latest Segment Anything computer vision models. Amazon has similar ambitions, and regularly introduces more sophisticated, AI-enabled robots in its logistics and warehouse facilities. Similarly, there are dozens of startups that compete with Physical Intelligence, with the likes of Gecko Robotics Inc., Genesis AI, Cobionix Corp. and FieldAI Inc. some of the latest to attract investment capital in recent months.

iRunFar reviews the best GPS watches for running from Garmin, Coros, Suunto, Amazfit, Apple, and Polar. A GPS watch can track various metrics before, during, and after your run and help you maximize your workouts. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi If you’re looking into options for the best GPS running watch and feeling overwhelmed by the options and their price tags, you’re not alone. As runners, many of us are deeply committed to the sport, and some of us have a thirst for our personal data rivaling the overlords at Meta. Then, others of us want a simple watch to keep track of time and maybe measure our heart rate. And then some runners choose to go with no technology at all. Regardless of where you fall on the spectrum, our testing of various GPS watches on the market will help you choose the best one for your needs and budget. When testing watches, our team looked at battery life, screen size, features, and durability. This guide builds on years of testing, comparing the latest watches to their predecessors and identifying what stands out. Our team of runners of all types analyzed which watches worked best for different situations, runner needs, and budgets. We continually update this guide as new models of watches hit the market. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is our favorite for its features, appearance, and price. If you’re looking for lower-priced options, we recommend the Suunto Run or the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro, as they provide a lot of features at a very reasonable price.. To learn more about the lingo associated with GPS watches, how we came up with our list of favorites, and things to consider when choosing yours, look at the how-to-choose section, frequently asked questions, and research and testing methodology below our picks. A GPS watch can let you track your data and splits throughout a run. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Pros: Cons: While Garmin has an array of watches ranging from those with every feature imaginable to reasonably basic, the Garmin Forerunner 570 is the most complete mid-premium device designed for runners that the brand has released. Five years ago, when I began testing GPS running watches in earnest, I was what you might call a “bigger is better” person — always reaching for the largest, most spec-heavy device available for trail running. I leaned heavily on Garmin’s fēnix and Enduro lines, including the Garmin fēnix 7 Solar Edition and the Garmin fēnix 8 AMOLED. I still respect how capable those adventure watches are, but over time, my priorities shifted. I’ve come to appreciate smaller, more running-focused designs with cleaner interfaces, less gimmickry — think solar-powered glass — and far more reasonable price tags. A thousand-dollar adventure watch just isn’t what most runners actually need. But one thing hasn’t changed, though: I still think Garmin makes the best all-around GPS running watch. Competing offerings from Coros, Suunto, and Amazfit are improving every year, but Garmin continues to dominate when it comes to accuracy, training depth, and ecosystem strength. The Forerunner 570 feels like the true sweet spot — bringing the precision and intelligence of Garmin’s fēnix and Epix lines to a lighter, more comfortable watch focused squarely on all runners. The 570 is lightweight and easy to wear all day, and it has an upgraded AMOLED display that’s bright without being overdone. It’s readable in intense sun, under dense tree cover, and at night without glare or blown-out contrast. Garmin’s classic five-button interface is still a huge advantage, especially while wearing gloves or trying to operate the watch while running on uneven surfaces. Weighing 50 grams, it’s a watch you forget you’re wearing. The 570 separates itself in GPS accuracy and trail performance. Garmin’s multi-band and multi-GNSS chipset now appears in this mid-tier model, offering the kind of precision you once had to buy a fēnix to get. Road pacing stays remarkably stable, even during surges or structured intervals. On the trail, the watch handles canyons, tree cover, switchbacks, and altitude shifts with impressive consistency. Satellite lock is near-instant, and track quality remains clean and believable even in environments that confuse cheaper sensors. Battery life continues the “just right” approach. You get 18 hours in all-systems GNSS and multi-band GPS mode, and about 11 days of use in smartwatch mode — enough for marathons, 50k races, and long training weeks without constant charging. Garmin’s training ecosystem remains unmatched, and the auto-climb feature stands out for trail runners, breaking climbs into segments so you can pace strategically. Navigation is another major strength, with offline maps, turn-by-turn routing, and seamless compatibility with Garmin Connect and Strava. The 570 isn’t flawless. Before a September race, I loaded my PacePro plan only for the watch to freeze at the starting line and becoming useless until it auto-restarted twenty minutes later, costing me several recorded miles. And offline Spotify integration, one of my must-have Garmin features, still suffers occasional playback interruptions. These frustrations stand out because the rest of the watch works so seamlessly. The Forerunner 570 balances elite accuracy, powerful training tools, excellent navigation, and comfort better than any other watch I’ve tested this year. It’s the most complete GPS running watch of 2025 — and the clear top pick. Pros: Cons: At its core, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 remains a productivity smartwatch designed for endurance athletes who want rugged hardware, deep health tracking, and outstanding GPS performance. The new Ultra 3 isn’t a radical departure from the Apple Watch Ultra 2, but a few key upgrades improve its functionality. Compared to the Ultra 2, this model offers longer battery life, a faster S10 processor, more storage, a larger and more efficient display, and, most excitedly for ultrarunners and backcountry athletes, emergency satellite connectivity. When off-grid, this watch can reach satellites to send messages, share your location, and communicate with emergency services — and it can do this all without your phone. While we haven’t had a chance to test this feature on this specific watch, we’ve been impressed with the reliability of the satellite communications of iPhones with similar technology. For trail runners, hikers, and anyone who ventures into remote terrain, this is a meaningful safety upgrade. The watch keeps the safety features of the previous version, like crash detection, fall detection, and an 86-decibel siren. Battery life is a tangible improvement this year. Apple claims up to 42 hours of regular use, 72 hours in low-power mode, and up to 14 hours of continuous GPS tracking with heart rate monitoring. If you need a longer tracking time, you can put the watch in low power mode where it makes fewer GPS and heart rate readings, and the battery will last up to 35 hours. The watch’s charging is faster now too, and runners can expect an 80% charge in about 45 minutes. For the display, a new OLED panel with a thinner bezel makes room for a slightly larger screen. The always-on mode now updates every second, which makes watch faces and data fields easier to read during a run. As before, brightness is excellent, and the touchscreen is quick and responsive — though still not ideal with wet hands or gloves. Some familiar drawbacks remain with the Apple Watch Ultra 3. You still need an Apple device to activate it, mapping and routing still lag behind dedicated sports watches, you can’t natively upload a route to follow during a workout, and the compass workaround requires manual juggling between apps. But as an all-in-one device, the Apple Watch Ultra 3 is outstanding. Running with only this watch and earbuds — with music, calls, messages, and safety features fully onboard — remains one of its biggest strengths. If you’re upgrading from a non-Ultra Apple Watch, the leap is a big one. For Ultra 2 owners, the decision to upgrade comes down to how much you value the better battery, larger display, and satellite safety features. Overall, this is the most capable Ultra watch yet — a rugged and connected device that can handle daily training and save your bacon in the backcountry without carrying an auxiliary device like a Garmin InReach. Pros: Cons: The Coros Apex 4 combines running-specific performance features with the ruggedness needed for mountain-sport athletes. In Coros’s athlete matrix, it’s not the Eliud Kipchoge or the Tommy Caldwell — it’s the Kilian Jornet: a blended runner, climber, and skier who goes long or short in a variety of environments. It showcases Coros’s most up-to-date technology — voice alerts, calls, voice pins, improved sensors, and more — wrapped in one distinctly low-tech choice by 2025 standards: a MIP display. In fact, it’s only one of two watches in this entire guide without an AMOLED display, and while that’s a matter of visual preference, the low-tech display’s impact on battery life is undeniably an advantage. The watch sits in the mid-tier price bracket and is competitive with its peers in some ways, and behind in others. That said, it’s also the strongest updates we’ve seen this year, bringing Coros’s newest features into a watch that’s far more usable for runners than the company’s newest outdoor flagship device, the Nomad. Having fully crossed over into the AMOLED era, I was legitimately shocked by the MIP display. Nearly every watch I’ve tested in the past two years has arrived with a bright, phone-like AMOLED panel. I was so surprised by the Apex 4’s dimness that I texted iRunFar founder and Gear Editor Bryon Powell to confirm whether it was just me. Bryon, not an AMOLED acolyte, finds the display perfectly suitable. It’s worth noting that the Apex 4 has no brightness adjustment, though runners can toggle a white background for slight improvement. The Apex 4 uses super-strong sapphire glass for exceptional durability and scratch-resistance, and is the same glass used on Coros’s highest-end mountain watches. Coros also adds the Action Button on the lower left side of the case that gives quick access to frequently used features — including your maps, saved pins, and any shortcuts you configure. For runners and mountain athletes who prefer tactile control over touchscreen swipes, the new button is a meaningful usability upgrade that makes mid-run navigation or note-taking dramatically more efficient. If maximizing battery is a priority, the Apex 4 is a better bet than Coros’s AMOLED models and offers 41 hours of GPS use. Satellite lock is near-instant, cornering is accurate, and elevation data is stable. In road, foothill, and track testing, it performed on par with the Coros Pace Pro and significantly better than older Apex models. It’s not quite to the level of Suunto Vertical 2 in extreme terrain, but everywhere else, it’s excellent. The Apex 4 debuts Coros’s most ambitious voice-tech package to date, and it’s genuinely useful. Voice alerts read out splits, laps, and heart rate zone changes clearly enough that you rarely need to look at the screen. You can answer calls via Bluetooth and dictate short voice pins mid-run, which sync to the app automatically. For trail runners who want to capture route notes, conditions, or nutrition reminders, voice pins are one of Coros’s best new features. The Apex 4 also brings Coros’s best mapping experience yet. Scrolling is fluid, labels are clearer than on any previous Apex, and map detail has been meaningfully upgraded. While AMOLED watches will always look sharper, the MIP maps remain surprisingly readable and deliver far superior battery endurance during navigation-heavy outings. The Apex 4 is Coros’s most complete iteration in this series. If you prioritize battery life, reliable GPS, excellent mapping, rugged durability, handy hardware controls, and surprisingly effective voice tech over a pretty screen, it’s one of the best performing watches of 2025. Pros: Cons: The Coros Vertix 2S is an upgrade on the previous watch in this category, the Coros Vertix 2. With improved GPS accuracy and the newest optical heart rate monitor, this watch’s updates are relatively minor. That said, we loved the last version, and this watch keeps everything we appreciated about its predecessor. We acknowledge that this probably isn’t a pure runner’s watch, but people who go on long adventures will use and appreciate the many features. The new upgrades actually decrease the battery life of this watch. Still, it has 118 hours of battery in standard GPS mode — nine hours less than the previous model. Much of the decrease comes from the new optical heart rate monitor sensor. The watch uses an algorithm to account for your running cadence to edit out the extraneous noise that often affects wrist heart rate measurements. We’ve always found this line of Coros watches to be the most accurate when navigating terrain without a clear view of the sky, like slot canyons in Utah. Compared to watches from other brands, its pings seemed to jump around far less. The body of this watch features sapphire glass and a titanium bezel, making it extremely rugged. It makes it less-than-ideal for casual wear for most people, but you can trust it to stand up to the rigors of the mountains. The 1.4-inch screen is larger than most others on the market and will dwarf smaller wrists, and some of our testers had a hard time fitting it through the wrist holes of shirts they were wearing. The large face does provide plenty of space to see up to eight data fields at once, and it makes navigation a little easier on the eyes. If you don’t like to charge your watch often or want one to accompany you on long adventure runs, fastpacks, or other multi-day expeditions, the battery life and features of the Coros Vertix 2S can’t be beaten. You can read more about the details of this watch in our in-depth Coros Vertix 2S review. Pros: Cons: One of the bigger surprises in the GPS watch market this year has been the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro. The watch offers the capabilities of a Garmin fēnix at a far more accessible price. With competitive battery life, one of the most stunning displays on any watch I’ve tested, and deep biometric analytics, the brand makes a compelling case as the best value in performance wearables right now. What immediately stands out is the 1.5-inch AMOLED display. It’s the brightest and most vivid screen we’ve tested, with contrast and sharpness that make traditional MIPS displays feel muted by comparison. If you’re coming from a Garmin fēnix, Coros Apex or Vertix, or any non-AMOLED device, one glance at the T-Rex 3 Pro is like a jolt of espresso — colors pop, maps are actually enjoyable to navigate, and data fields are legible at every angle. Amazfit has spent the past few years quietly reinventing itself from a budget-friendly alternative into a legitimate challenger to the legacy GPS brands. The design is bold and armored, albeit a tad chintzy — kind of like a generic PC next to a cutting-edge looking Apple — but it’s much more refined than previous generations. Amazfit uses sapphire glass on this rugged trail model, and durability appears excellent so far. I haven’t crash-tested it with a full trail wipeout, but after several scrapes against granite and sandstone, the lens remains completely scratch-free. Under open skies, accuracy is strong, pacing is stable, and satellite lock is quick. On dense, winding trails, the watch still performs well overall, though it doesn’t quite match Garmin’s top chipsets. Occasional micro-wobbles happen in tough conditions, but they’re rare. What stands out most is the responsiveness — pace changes register quickly without smoothing or lag, a feature that has historically held back value-tier watches. Battery life remains one of Amazfit’s defining advantages, with up to 38 hours of dual-band GPS use. With dual-band GPS and always-on display active, the T-Rex 3 Pro still lasts multiple training days before needing a charge. With settings optimized, stretching it beyond a week is easy. Amazfit’s health and training ecosystem — built on parent company Zepp’s operating system — continues to mature. Stress scores, sleep tracking, recovery metrics, and training load estimates are all here. Garmin still leads in coaching and long-term analytics, but the Zepp app presents data in a clean and intuitive manner, and the overall experience is smooth. Navigation features include turn-by-turn guidance, offline maps, and reliable syncing with popular route platforms. Smartwatch features like notifications, weather, music control, and a growing Zepp OS app library round out the package and make the watch feel far more premium than its price. The T-Rex 3 Pro represents the most polished version of Amazfit’s identity: bold, durable, extraordinarily bright, and packed with functionality. It doesn’t quite match Garmin’s ecosystem depth, but no other brand delivers this level of performance, ruggedness, and battery life for the price. Pros: Cons: Suunto has long been known for its rugged, mountain-ready — and sometimes comically bulky looking on normal or small wrists — multisport watches, and the Suunto Run takes a refreshing U-turn toward almost extreme minimalism. If you have used a Suunto in the past, taking the Run out of the box will have you double-checking your assumptions, and actually wearing the Run — with its super-comfortable, soft nylon strap — will reveal its key advantage. At only 36 grams with the textile ban, it is easily the lightest watch in this buyer’s guide, though the new Coros Pace 4 takes the lightest title this year at 32 grams. As for performance, it also ramps up processing power and has a decreased lag time while in an activity and scrolling through data pages. The AMOLED display is brilliantly bright and very easy to read, with large digits and uncluttered data fields that make quick glances simple. The interface is intuitive, and menus are structured logically enough to learn the watch in minutes. It truly prioritizes activity — not bells and whistles — so much so that you can navigate to start a run in just one click. Build quality is far better than expected at this price, with a sturdy polymer case, stainless steel bezel, Gorilla glass, and strong water and impact resistance. GPS accuracy is one of the watch’s strongest attributes. Suunto’s heritage in navigation shows even in this entry-level model. The watch has a dual-band multi-GNSS chipset — awesome for a watch at this price point — allowing it to lock onto the best available satellites for optimal accuracy. Post-run syncing and processing speed are historically two of Suunto’s biggest pain points. Both are improved but still the slowest among the watches in this guide. Compared to other watches in this guide, the Suunto Run’s battery life is just average. You can expect about 20 hours of GPS runtime in the highest-accuracy dual-band satellite mode with bio-monitoring and brightness features on high, and you’ll get upward of 40 hours with the power-saving GPS mode enabled. Training features focus on essentials rather than advanced analytics. A reliable optical heart-rate sensor, basic recovery indicators, structured interval support, and suggested workouts give new runners everything they need to build fitness safely. Pace, distance, cadence, and effort metrics sync seamlessly to platforms like the Suunto app, Strava, and TrainingPeaks. The Suunto Run nails exactly what beginners need: accuracy, durability, simplicity, and value. It feels intentionally designed to remove friction, reduce distractions, and give new runners a trustworthy, confidence-building tool. For anyone buying their first GPS device or returning to running with a desire for clarity and ease, this is the most compelling entry-level option. Pros: Cons: At around $600 (stainless steel) and $700 (titanium), the Suunto Vertical 2 brings the brand’s strongest hardware to date, with their latest chipsets, sensors, and processing power. GPS accuracy is exceptional, and the new heart-rate sensor finally produces readings that rival your old chest strap. There’s plenty of onboard storage for free worldwide maps — though downloading a state-sized region like Colorado still takes close to an hour over Wi-Fi. Battery life is outstanding, providing nearly 60 hours of continuous, full-accuracy GPS on a single charge, and over 200 hours in the deepest power-saving modes. Design is where the Vertical 2 truly separates itself. Suunto continues to favor clean geometry, symmetry, and subtle material transitions. Suunto has unveiled a raft of new watches over the last few years, expanding their options to meet runners and outdoor athletes with new price points and features that better match a wide variety of needs. With all its new watches, Suunto has retained its Scandinavian design aesthetic, which, to me, still presents the most premium, cleanest, and aesthetically pleasing GPS watches on the market. A major part of Suunto’s design aesthetic now centers around the AMOLED display. Suunto has rolled out the display across its entire running and outdoor line and has even said it likely won’t produce another MIP device again. That’s great news for fans of crystal-clear brightness and HD-quality mapping, though a concern if you prefer the softer, less power-hungry feel of MIP screens. Still, on a 1.5-inch display — the largest in this guide — AMOLED looks outstanding. And since the Vertical 2 no longer uses the solar energy-collecting glass found on the first Vertical, Suunto reclaimed even more space for visibility and mapping detail on the front panel. Despite its substantial size, the Vertical 2 sits flatter and more naturally on the wrist than earlier Suunto giants thanks to tapered walls and angles. The thick silicone strap remains one of the best in the industry: soft, slightly stretchy, and secure. It’s comfortable enough to be positioned on the wrist where the heart rate sensor sits best. The three widely spaced metal buttons maintain Suunto’s minimalist ethos and provide a firm, glove-friendly click. Suunto has added a feature that seems small but becomes indispensable once you use it: a very bright front-of-unit flashlight — as opposed to the backlight-based flashlight on the Suunto Race series. With multiple brightness settings, it’s remarkable for navigating camp or just making it to the bathroom in the middle of the night without your phone. As you might expect, this is a watch that harkens back to Suunto’s past: a huge display, a thick, ultra-comfortable strap, and a bomb-proof bezel. But it pairs that classic ruggedness with modern components, one of the best displays in the category, and a level of industrial design that remains unique to Suunto. Shop the Suunto Vertical 2 - stainless steelShop the Vertical 2 - titanium Pros: Cons: Coming from a brand that used to dominate fitness devices 15 years ago, the Polar Grit X2 is a return to the competitive end of the market for the company. Polar has existed as a fitness device brand for over 50 years, but seemed to lose its footing around the 2010s when you couldn’t line up to a running, cycling, or other endurance activity or race without seeing a Polar heart rate chest strap, cadence monitor, bike computer, or wrist watch attached to nearly every athlete in the field. Since then, Polar has been flat-out eclipsed by a core set of running watch brands that have been faster to react, market, and innovate for modern customers. Despite getting overtaken by Coros, Garmin, Suunto, and even Apple, Polar has quietly produced some excellent devices over the past couple of years with competitive features and a software ecosystem that could be described as quirky — in a good way! The Grit X2 took a long time to make it to the United States market after becoming available in Europe early in the year. The scuttlebutt suggests that some tenuous trade agreements could be behind the delay, as well as the cost. At $800 the Grit X2 is very expensive, though it is the “affordable” option behind its even more expensive sibling, the Grit X2 Pro, which comes in at $1,000. The X2 is a tad lighter, smaller, and slower compared to the Grit X2 Pro, but it has the same gorgeous AMOLED display and a highly adequate battery life of around 30 hours in its best performance mode. The Grit X2 — like the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Apex 4 — is a capable running watch that also plays well in other mountain sports settings. The watch’s Scandinavian design is similar in some ways to Suunto’s balance of rugged but not bulky. It has a 1.28-inch display protected by sapphire glass, and it has proven to be extremely easy to read in bright sunlight and has withstood a couple big diggers. Despite all this toughness, it remains wearable for everyday use, and the tactile buttons are optimized for gloved hands, making it truly a watch that can handle city streets, mountain summits, and everything in between. In short, the Polar Grit X2 is a well-rounded, highly capable watch that deserves more attention from outdoor athletes and runners alike. It proves that Polar can still compete with the biggest names in the industry. While it may not have dominated headlines like Garmin or Apple over the past decade, the Grit X2 quietly delivers on all fronts: accurate dual-band GPS chipset, advanced biosensing, robust navigation, and rugged durability. The Coros Vertix 2S offers a wide range of features and great battery life but is too big for casual wear for many.

Photo: iRunFar/Christin Randall Accuracy What we fundamentally want from the best GPS watch for running is to correctly measure a run’s distance, pace, and elevation change. Thanks to incredible innovation in satellite technology and specific algorithms designed for sports by watch manufacturers, we now have incredibly complex technology in a package small enough for your wrist. Even relatively inexpensive watches like the Suunto Run have exceptional GPS accuracy. When it comes to accuracy, we’re often perplexed when, after trail running with a friend, we compare distance and vertical gain and see different results. This is sometimes a function of different brands’ technology, but it is often a function of battery power-saving modes, the number of GPS readings per minute you’ve selected, or the default settings on your watch. Utilizing the maximum location measurement frequency will sap a watch battery, but while spacing out the readings is easier on the battery, it creates a less precise track. Obstructions in the sky, like trees or even clouds, can affect GPS accuracy, and the industry suggests GPS accuracy is within 1% to 3%. Manufacturers recommend importing your data to a run-specific app, like Garmin Connect or the Suunto App, to corroborate your data with more sophisticated elevation models. We found that the most accurate GPS watch we tested was the Coros Vertix 2S, especially in areas where we didn’t have a clear view of the sky. Battery Life Battery life is arguably the most prized feature for ultrarunners looking for the best GPS watch. Fortunately, we are in something of a battery life golden age. Every major GPS watch company seeks to one-up their competitor to own the title of longest-lasting battery. This competition benefits the customer, as we’re not only getting batteries that can last up to 118 hours of normal GPS use, as with the Coros Vertix 2S, but they also charge incredibly fast. When just a few years ago, companies would boast about 15 to 20 hours of battery life, and their watches might take three to five hours to charge from dead, we’re getting massive increases in battery life and equally as big drops in charging time. The Suunto Vertical 2 can go from dead to fully charged in under an hour and will then measure over 60 hours of activity. Companies’ claims about battery life represent use with standard GPS tracking alone, without the additional battery demands of using navigation, receiving notifications, or playing music. Rather than manually tuning your watch to the best or worst battery performance, many manufacturers have preset battery modes that allow you to select the performance level you require based on your activity or the remaining battery power on the watch. Suunto watches are known for their sleek, Scandinavian designs. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Comfort Years ago, GPS watches looked like tiny computers on your wrist, and some, like the Suunto Vertical 2, are continuing to lean into the rugged and large aesthetic. As time passes, GPS watch sizes are getting more compact, and breakthroughs in technical performance are shrinking the package while adding new features. Many brands offer different strap styles in addition to the normal silicone one, including nylon and other soft-style straps with elastic and hook-and-loop closures. These styles can add comfort and a more precise fit. The best example of this is the band included with the Suunto Run — it’s so light and comfortable you might forget you’re wearing it. All the watches in this guide are comfortable enough to wear all day, but the appropriateness of wearing a GPS watch to work or other life commitments varies depending on the user. Watches like the Suunto Run or the Polar Grit X2 are small and stylish enough to wear in everyday life, while many people would shy away from wearing the Suunto Vertical 2 or similar rugged-looking watches in casual settings. Ease of Use The incredible technology in the best GPS running watches means there can be a learning curve to taking advantage of their full functionality. Not a single watch here is simple enough to pull out of the box and use all of the features immediately. You might be able to record a run — but what next? Do you use the watch’s corresponding app to synchronize it? Do you make adjustments in the watch itself or with the app? Is it a combination of both? These are questions you’ll need to sort out as you begin accessing features on your watch and learning its capabilities. The Suunto Run is one of the simplest watches to learn to use. With so many options and the amount of data provided, it even takes time to remember which buttons control selections and navigate forward or back. Some watches have a bold start/stop button distinct from the others. The watches in this guide use buttons, scrolling dials, touchscreens, or a combination of all three to operate. Buttons are simple to use on the fly, but dials, like on the Coros Apex 4, can be tricky to use quickly. Buttons are generally big and responsive, with some performing much better than others. The watches in this guide with touchscreens generally work well even in wet or cold conditions. Extra Features and App Compatibility Each watch in this guide has a corresponding mobile app that can do everything from downloading your runs and sharing with a third-party app like Strava to designing and synchronizing routes. The apps can also control the colors and display of the watch face and synchronize firmware. Many watches have a coaching component that allows you to customize your workout or download workouts directly from professional athletes. The Polar Grit X2 has a suite of features, including hydration tracking and menstrual cycle tracking. Several watches in this guide can sync offline playlists from streaming services like Spotify, or have built-in storage for music playback. Some watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Garmin Forerunner 570, have Mobile Pay. iRunFar’s Meghan Hicks tests the Coros Vertix 2 in the slot canyons of Utah. We found it to provide more accurate GPS tracking than other watches in areas like slot canyons. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi We at iRunFar are GPS running watch aficionados with a long history of testing watches. Many of our team members love pouring over running data, and we use our watches to collect accurate metrics of our runs and health. For the initial version of this guide, we combined our more than 100 years of GPS running watch field testing with polls of the iRunFar community to see what everyone thought was the best GPS running watch on the market. We selected nearly a dozen highly vetted watches for rigorous summer, fall, winter, and spring testing. We tested these watches in climates from the densely forested northwestern United States to the cold, dry, and variable seasons of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. We took different GPS watches out in difficult terrain, like slot canyons in Utah and mountains in Bhutan, to see if there was a difference in accuracy in places where they didn’t get a clear view of the sky. We evaluated the watches based on their features, price, comfort, processing speed, accuracy, navigation capabilities, battery life, and compatibility with third-party apps. We continue to test new watches and update this guide when needed. What is a GPS watch, and why is it helpful in trail running and ultrarunning? Besides shorts and shoes, many runners consider a GPS watch a fundamental piece of running gear. It lets you easily and accurately record your runs and see important data. like pace and elevation gain, while you’re out there. The data synchronizes with popular apps, allowing you to compare or log your information securely. It’s a training log that doesn’t take up physical space. Moreover, the watches in this guide work for more than just running. They track tons of other sports, such as paddleboarding, yoga, and cycling, and collect the unique metrics associated with each activity. Every watch in this guide can significantly improve your understanding of your body and training. The Garmin Forerunner 570 combines a lot of useful features for a reasonably competitive price. This is not to suggest that trail or ultrarunning requires a GPS watch. For many, the invasion of more and more data in our lives is becoming burdensome and tiring. A pen-and-paper training journal combined with a simple stopwatch or using your smartphone with any number of free run-recording apps is much more inexpensive and simple. The Suunto Race has a variety of activity options besides running. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which running watch has the best GPS? Each watch tested in this guide does a fine job of tracking your run. Positioning in these watches is usually acquired through one or a combination of the five major satellite systems (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, QZSS, and Beidou). Different satellite systems have variable accuracy in different areas of the world. Incremental differences appear between all of the watches, even on the same activity, yet none of the watches tested here has an outlying poor output. The Coros Vertix 2S has a feature that seeks to combat satellite interference, whether it’s from a dense forest or a deep canyon, by utilizing all five satellite systems at once. Choosing the best GPS watch could almost be more a matter of what else it has beyond good GPS accuracy, since there isn’t a poor performer among the bunch in this guide. Apple watches can provide the same tracking and health metrics of top GPS watches. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi I want to race my first ultramarathon. Which GPS running watch should I use? Many people will simply use their phone and the app like Strava for their first ultra. This is a low-cost and simple way to use a piece of hardware you already own and are probably going to carry regardless. The drawback is that your phone has a battery that probably won’t last beyond 50k. If you’re new to ultrarunning and simply looking for the best GPS running watch for reliability and affordability, the Suunto Run and Garmin Forerunner 570 are excellent and affordable options. You won’t get all the fancy features of the highest-end watches, but you’ll get enough battery to last nearly any ultra. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro also packs in a lot of features at a reasonable price point. For ultrarunners who want to get the most technology, data, and performance out of their races and training, this guide has some truly exceptional options, namely the Suunto Vertical 2 and Coros Vertix 2S. What’s the difference between a fitness tracker and a running watch? This is a question mainly regarding features. Fitness trackers have come a long way and are more affordable than any watches tested in this guide. But their downside is that they rely heavily on pairing with a phone to draw out similar features that are built directly into GPS watches. The health and sleep monitoring features of the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro and the Polar Grit X2 can give you much of the information that dedicated fitness trackers provide. From intervals to health metrics, GPS watches can measure and track all of your data. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi Which is the most accurate GPS watch? When comparing all of the watches tested here on the same 25-kilometer run, not a single one had exact fidelity when comparing the GPX track to the trail marked on Mapbox, the commercial map provider for everything from Strava to the navigation system in your car. In some cases, the track showed a tester crossing an alpine lake, which they didn’t, or taking a very long detour around part of a forest. You might expect the same brand of watches to provide the same output, but that wasn’t the case. There were deviations between watches across the board. We found that the advanced GPS system of the Coros Vertix 2S outperformed other watches when it came to difficult conditions, such as in slot canyons or under heavy tree cover. Two of our testers who run together frequently find that a Coros watch consistently measures more distance when compared to a Garmin, but the Garmin reports more elevation gain. The consistency of the variability points toward differences in the algorithms used by the watches to calculate these numbers. The industry says that most GPS watches are accurate within 1% to 3%, which explains the deviation in watches, even when tested simultaneously. A few watches have special features to improve their accuracy. Suunto employs its “Snap to Route,” where you could take a GPX file, load it into the watch, and then navigate that course while you run. This is a clever way to ensure that your run is as faithful to the intended route as possible, and it minimizes error due to satellite reception and other variables, like clouds, buildings, or other obstructions. We asked the Garmin product manager to explain the differences between measurements of different watches on the same course. They said, “There are numerous challenges in forming an elevation profile over a long trail run or ultramarathon, like effects of weather over longer periods and how the watch is worn (for example, if the barometer port is up against clothing).” They continued, “Because of these sources of error, we expect differences in the total ascent between runners, and these can add up over long-distance runs. On the distance side, GPS accuracy is the biggest thing. User settings, type of device, which arm the user is wearing the watch, running form, and environment (tree cover can affect the line of sight to satellites) can all affect accuracy.” The Garmin Forerunner 165 Music is a great entry-level GPS watch that is simple to navigate and use. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi These watches are so expensive! What is the best budget running watch? You’ll have to spend some money to get a reasonable GPS watch, though there are major variations in the price points among the different options. Chiefly, the ever-mind-blowing strength of their batteries that dictate the cost, plus a suite of other features that help you understand your physiology, including heart rate and blood oxygen saturation. A GPS watch can replace your phone as a podcast or music device, and they are incredibly durable with their titanium, steel, and sapphire materials. The Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro offers many of the features of a high-end watch at a much lower price. What’s the best running watch for small wrists? Many GPS watches, like the Coros Vertix 2S, have big displays that look massive on even average-sized wrists. The large size makes it easier to see a lot of data and to navigate with offline maps. The Suunto Run, with a much sleeker design, won’t swallow smaller wrists. These two are at opposite ends of the price spectrum, separated by about $400. In the end, the best GPS running watch for you will be one that you’re comfortable wearing, so it’s worth considering fit when choosing one. Both road and trail runners can benefit from the data collected by a GPS watch. Photo: iRunFar/Eszter Horanyi What GPS running watch best integrates with smart technology so that I can stay connected while running? All the watches in this guide — including the least expensive Suunto Run — display notifications from incoming calls, text messages, and emails on their screens. You must connect the watch to your smartphone via Bluetooth for this to work. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is essentially a phone on your wrist. I am bad with technology. What running watch is the easiest to use? If ultrarunning is your primary sport, many of these GPS watches are overbuilt for what you actually need in terms of features. The Garmin Forerunner 570 is one of the more pared-down of these options, but it still has all of the features a runner needs. The Apple Watch Ultra 3 is also an excellent option for those who struggle with technology. Like most Apple products, it provides a great user experience, and the dedicated action button makes it easy to put it on your wrist and go. It will still interpret your daily data, including sleep, and can guide you in improving your fitness and health. Related articles: Craig Randall is a Gear Editor and Buyer’s Guide Writer at iRunFar.

Title: Bubble fears ease but investors still waiting for AI to live up to its promise
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/20/nvidia-ai-bellwether/

By MICHAEL LIEDTKE Fears about the artificial intelligence boom turning into an overblown bubble have diminished for now, thanks to a stellar earnings report from Nvidia that illustrated why its indispensable chips transformed it into the world’s most valuable company. But that doesn’t mean the specter of an AI bubble won’t return in the months and years ahead as Big Tech gears up to spend trillions of dollars more on a technology the industry’s leaders believe will determine the winners and losers during the next wave of innovation. For now, at least, Nvidia has eased worries that the AI craze propelling the stock market and much of the economy for the past year is on the verge of a massive collapse. If anything, Nvidia’s quarterly report indicated that AI spending is picking up even more momentum. The highlights, released late Wednesday, included quarterly revenue of $57 billion, a 62% increase from the same time last year. That sales growth was an acceleration from the 56% increase in year-over-year revenue from the May-July quarter. What’s more, Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the current quarter covering November-January, which would be a 65% year-over-year increase. Given Nvidia’s forecasts, “it is very hard to see how this stock does not keep moving higher from here,” according to analysts at UBS led by Timothy Arcuri. The UBS analyst also said the “AI infrastructure tide is still rising so fast that all boats will be lifted.” Nvidia’s numbers are viewed through a window that extends far beyond the Santa Clara, California, company’s headquarters because its products are needed by a wide range of companies — including Big Tech peers like Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta Platforms — to build data centers that are becoming known as AI factories. “AI spending isn’t just holding up, it’s accelerating. That’s exactly what the market needed to see,” said Jake Behan, head of capital markets for investment firm Direxion. The numbers initially lifted Nvidia’s stock price by as much as 5% in Thursday’s trading, while other tech stocks tied to the AI spending frenzy also got a boost. But Nvidia’s shares and other tech stocks reversed course later in the session as investors found other issues besides AI, such as the government’s latest jobs report and the future direction of interest rates. Even with a 3% drop in its stock price amid the broader market decline, Nvidia remains valued at $4.4 trillion, more than 10 times its valuation three years ago when OpenAI released its ChatGPT chatbot, triggering the biggest technological shift since Apple released the iPhone in 2007. Nvidia’s rapid rise has turned its CEO Jensen Huang into the chief evangelist for the AI revolution and he sought to use his bully pulpit during a late Wednesday conference call with industry analysts to make a case that the spending to make technology with humanlike intelligence is just beginning. “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different,” Huang insisted while celebrating “depth and breadth” of Nvidia’s growth. Huang is hardly a lone voice in the wilderness. A recent report from Gartner Inc. estimates that worldwide spending on AI will rise to more than $2 trillion next year, a 37% increase from the nearly $1.5 trillion that the research firm expects to be spent this year. But it remains to be seen if all that money pouring into AI will actually produce all the profits and productivity that proponents have been promising. That leaves the question unanswered if all the real spending that’s happening will be worth it. The most recent survey of global fund managers by Bank of America showed a record percentage of investors saying companies are “overinvesting.” Big Tech is already so profitable that many of the most successful finance their spending sprees with their ongoing stream of revenue and cash hoards in their bank accounts. But some companies, such as Meta Platforms and Oracle, are relying more heavily on debt to fund their AI ambitions — a strategy that has raised enough alarms among investors that their stock prices have plunged more dramatically than their peers in recent weeks. Both Meta and Oracle have suffered more than 20% declines in their stock prices since late October. But other Big Tech powerhouses leading the way in AI remain just behind Nvidia and iPhone maker Apple in the rankings of the most valuable companies. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon boast market values currently ranging from $2.3 trillion to $3.6 trillion. “It is true that valuations are high and that there is some froth in the market, however, the spending on AI is real,” said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for money manager Northlight Asset Management. “Whether or not the spending turns out to be overdone won’t be known for many years.” AP Business Writer Stan Choe in New York contributed to this story.

Title: Even Realities Even G2 Review: Anti-Meta Smart Glasses With Real Potential
URL: https://gizmodo.com/even-realities-even-g2-review-2000687632
Time Published: 2025-11-20T20:23:45Z

Reading time 11 minutes What exactly doÂ smart glasses need to be smart? If you’re Meta, the answer to that question revolves around two things: cameras and audio. Sure, the Meta Ray-Ban Display have a screen in them, but there are only a couple of major things that allÂ of Meta’s smart glasses have in common, and that’s the ability to take pictures/videos and play audio. Those features can be useful, but they also come with their own drawbacks. Not only are smart glasses with cameras and speakers less private by virtue of the fact that you’re walking around with a gadget that records discreetly from your face, but they also weigh a lot more and look less like regular glasses. Adding hardware adds heft. It’s simple math. Even Realities Even G2 The Even G2 smart glasses have a great display and nice hardware, but they're plagued by bugs. Pros Cons But just because that’s what Meta thinks a pair of smart glasses needs doesn’t mean that’s where everyone’s head is at. There are some smart glasses purveyors asking what happens when you subtract from that equation, and the results, as I’ve found with Even Realities Even G2, can be interesting, encouraging, and sometimes a little frustrating. Even Realities is perhaps the main company making what I call “anti-Meta smart glasses” right now, and it recently released the Even G2, its second pair of smart glasses without cameras or speakers. Like the Even G1 predecessor, these smart glasses center around a screen, which in this case is a dual-lens display that outputs only in monochrome green. Unlike the Even G1, the Even G2’s display gets an assist from new hardwareâthe Even R1, an optional smart ring sold separately for navigating the UI that also doubles as a health tracker. The combination of screen and smart glasses can be a promising one. While I was worried about inputs on the Even R1 feeling laggy, I actually found sliding my thumb around the ceramic smart ring to work most of the time. To activate the Even G2 displays, all you need to do is double-tap with your thumb. To scroll between menu options, you slide your thumb up or down. To select, you give the Even R1 a single tap. You can also hold your thumb down on the smart ring to bring up a quick dashboard to check notifications or activate features like the teleprompter or translate. While inputs work fairly well, they’re far from perfect. Sometimes I find myself having to double-tap multiple times to get the results I want, and other times I scroll past my intended destination in a menu. It’s not enough to make me want to toss the Even R1 out completely and give up like other smart rings I hesitate to even mention, but there’s some refinement to be done here if Even Realities wants the smart ring to be theÂ best way of navigating a pair of smart glasses. The Even R1 controls may not be as nuanced as the gestures in the Meta Ray-Ban Display, aÂ “Neural Band” wristband that reads the electrical signals in your arm, but it’s a heck of a lot less invasive, and it certainly doesn’t leave a giant red mark on your wrist afterwards. It’s also, unfortunately, $250 in addition to the $600 price tag of the Even G2 smart glasses, so there’s that. Thankfully, the smart ring is, again, optional and not required to use the Even G2. As an input system, it’s safe to call the Even R1 solid, but there’s room for future improvement. A smart ring is only part of the equation; it’s also about what you can actually doÂ with said ring that matters. In the Even G2’s case, there are quite a few features that can be nice to have when they actually work. While you obviously won’t be taking pictures or videos, listening to music, or taking calls, the Even G2 isÂ set up for things like notifications. The Even G2, through the companion app, can show you text messages from your phone, emails, messages from apps like Instagram, WhatsApp, Snapchat, and Telegram, and native calendar notifications. Most of these worked for me after enabling them in the app and then force-resetting the Even G2 (not exactly a smooth process), but I wasn’t able to get text messages to show up in iOS 26 on my iPhone 17. I should also mention that Instagram messages, which I got to work on the Even G2, decided to randomly stop working, and would only return after resetting the smart glasses completely. These are the types of quirks I found in lots of corners of the Even G2. That being said, if you do manage to get notifications working, depending on what your style is, you can choose to have the smart glasses show them automatically or have them delivered discreetly so you can go in manually and check the notifications section in the Even G2 UI. You cannot, however, respond to messages; these smart glasses are for notifications only, which is a major disadvantage compared to the Meta Ray-Ban Display that do let you reply with dictation. Another cool thing the Even G2 (when coupled with the Even R1) can do is give you information about your health. I wouldn’t call the metrics real-time by any means, though they are updated… intermittently. Maybe a little too intermittently for my taste, especially if you’re trying to do something important like tracking your heart rate or your calories burned while running. The lack of up-to-date or even real-time health stats makes this feature a little less useful or interesting than it could be. It’s hard to say what the cadence of updating is, or what triggers an update to the health app in the Even G2, but it could take a while. Sometimes the health metrics also like to disappear from the health widget entirely, which is not great. When that happens, I have to unpair and repair the glasses to get them back. Sometimes I have to reset the smart glasses entirely. Sometimes none of those things work, and I’m just screwed, and I have to wait around for things to start working again. Needless to say, none of that is ideal. Like the Oura ring, the Even R1 tracks steps, calories burned, sleep, skin temperature, heart rate, heart beat intervals, and blood oxygen. While I probably won’t find most of that useful (that’s just me, maybe you will), I did like the sleep tracking, which logs time awake, REM, core sleep, and deep sleep as separate categories. It also provides a sleep score, which one night, for me, was a 77 out of 100. The score, according to Even Realities, is calculated based on things like duration, efficiency, and the balance of the sleep stages throughout the night. Needless to say, it wasn’t the greatest night’s sleep I’ve had. If you’re just looking for a health wearable, you shouldn’t buy the Even R1 (Oura or a Samsung Galaxy Ring still does more, especially with scores and guidance), but it’s nice to have those features (when they work) on top of having a controller for your smart glasses. Other features include navigation, which can be used by selecting the “navigate” option in the Even G2’s UI or by using the onboard voice assistant. I tried navigating to the Brooklyn Museum from my apartment, and it seemed to work just fine. By saying, “Hey Even, navigate to the Brooklyn Museum,” a small map surfaces in the bottom right with turn-by-turn navigation in the bottom left. At the top-right, you’ll get the distance and the time it takes to get to your destination. If you want a larger view, you can tap once on the Even R1 or on either of the two touchpads located on each of the temple tips, and then tap to go back. I like the Even G2’s navigation both because it could be useful for biking or if you just don’t feel like pulling your phone out, but also because it looks like a lo-fi analog map from The Matrix or from the movie Alien.Â I know this probably wasn’t the intention here, but I appreciate the aesthetic either way. Like many other smart glasses, there’s also a translation feature, which has both upsides and downsides. I had my partner speak Spanish to me, which was translated into English, and I liked that the translated text seemed to do a better job of conveying the Spanish phrases in a way an English speaker would understand than other smart glasses I’ve used. It also translated fairly quickly, which is important if you’re using this feature in the real world. One thing I didn’t like, however, is that they struggled to pick certain phrases up. I can’t tell if the microphones are maybe not as powerful as on other smart glasses or if the software is just a little slow, but the Even G2 are a little harder of hearing than on Meta’s Ray-Ban Display in my experience. There’s also a feature called “Conversate,” which listens in on conversations and transcribes them in front of your eyes. Unlike other smart glasses transcription features, the Even G2 attempts to add context. When taking a work meeting, I had the Even G2’s Conversate feature activated, and the results were a little silly at times. While it did an okay job of hearing mostÂ of what was said, it also misheard things and added irrelevant context. For instance, it misheard my name and called me James Pierre, and also misunderstood when someone said the name of a website, instead providing a definition for the literal word, instead of background on the site itself. It was nice, however, to be able to go back into the Even app to review what we spoke about; here you’ll get an AI summary andÂ a transcript. In an ideal world where AI is a lot smarter than it is right now, Conversate could potentially be useful, but as it stands, features like Conversate are hit-or-miss, no matter how well-intentioned they are. Lastly, there are separate widgets in the Even G2 for news and for stocks, if that’s your jam. Scrolling through them isn’t ideal from a UI perspective since you have to actually tap through one article to get to the next, but it is sharp enough to be legible. To scroll, you can use the Even R1 or the glasses’ touch controls on the tips of the Even G2. Stocks seemed to work okay, though I don’t have any money, so I don’t think that’ll be a feature that I use much. If you doÂ have money, you can add your preferred stocks via the Even app, and they’ll show up in a separate widget inside the Even G2 UI. Altogether, the features inside the Even G2 are actually thoughtful, though due to some bugginess with the app and the hardware, they’re not quite as useful as they could be at this point. I want to hope that they can get better with time, but for now, this is the level of polish I’m able to comment on. And speaking of polish, I should also note here that I had quite a few issues trying to get the Even G2 set up, where neither it nor the R1 would stay connected to my iPhone via Bluetooth. As I understand from some digging on Reddit, finicky Bluetooth connections are a common complaint among owners of the Even G1, and there’s a chance that those issues may have carried over into the second generation. While I was eventually able to get the smart glasses stable enough for testing by resetting them and updating the firmware in both devices, you should be aware of those pitfalls before you buy, and brace yourself for them not improving over time. One thing I really like about the Even G2 and the Even R1 is the hardware. Even Realities’ whole shtick is that its smart glasses are glasses first, and on that front, the Even G2 succeed. Because of the lack of cameras and speakers, they’re lightweight at just 36.5g as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which are 69g. The use of titanium for the frames also helps keep the Even G2 light. They feel great on my face, and they fit my head well, too, which is a major plus. I wore the Even G2 and the Even R1 for almost the entirety of a workday, which in my case is like 10 hours, and I wasn’t ready to rip them off my face, nor did they leave huge marks on my head and nose. If I were to wear one pair of smart glasses all the time, this might be it. The look might not be for everyone, but I like the slightly rounded frames and the metal arms. On the tips of each arm, there are also touch controls for navigating the smart glasses and waking them up. One tap is select, two taps wake them up or goes back in the UI, and swiping to the front or to the back wheels the Even G2’s menus up or down, respectively. I also appreciate the screen, which Even Realities is calling the 3D floating display, a dual-lens system that uses micro LED. Even Realities says that the Even G2 is 50% sharper than the first generation of glasses, thanks to its redesigned optical system, and I believe that figure. Overall, I find the Even G2 to have a much sharper display than the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which makes reading notifications or even full-on articles easy on the eyes. The display isn’t the brightest in the worldâit’s 1,200 nits as opposed to the Meta Ray-Ban Display, which can go up to 5,000 nitsâbut it’s not slouching either. It’s also adjustable in the Even app so you can choose whether you want the display to appear mid, near, or far, and even position where the screen shows up in a vertical alignment (top or bottom). Having used AR glasses that don’t have adjustable screens in the past, this could be the difference between being able to see the display or not for some people. Sure, you’re not getting any color through the Even G2 waveguides, but for what the smart glasses are going for, I think the display is done well. While the screen is generally non-invasive, it’ll depend on what exactly you’re doing with the Even G2. For instance, things like notifications will appear in smaller boxes that disappear in 10 seconds by default, while the main menu can take up about 25% of the lenses depending on what your settings are in the display section of the app (again, there are settings for near, mid, and far as well as height options). To get a sense, when a new article is fully open, you’ll get a headline, a subhead, and most or all of the first paragraph. All of the menus inside the Even G2 are quite simple, usually consisting of text inside a box (the news widget, for example) or maybe graphs and numbers (the stock widget and health widget). They’re meant for at-a-glance information and nothing more. As long as you’re okay with glanceable chunks of data, like the time, temperature, date, orÂ number-based health metrics and email subjects/snippets, the Even G2 will most likely satisfy you with its display legibility and simplified UI. Battery life on the Even G2 glasses and the Even R1 ring is fairly solid. Even Realities advertises about two days of use, and after using the glasses and ring intermittently throughout the day for a period of about 10 hours, both were around 80%. To charge the Even G2, there’s an included charging case, while the Even R1 ring uses an included magnetic charger, which is a small pedestal connected to a USB-C cable. You can check the Even G2 and Even R1 battery life in the app to see if you need more juice. If you wear prescription lenses, you’re in luck here; the Even G2 supports people who need to actually wear glasses. The display is easily my favorite part of the Even G2, and while it doesn’t support full color, I can’t say I’m super bummed about that, given what the glasses are designed to do at this juncture in time. For notifications and navigation, all you need is a sharp, bright, Matrix-esque screen. Despite how frustrating the Even G2 and the Even R1 were to set up and how annoying they are when they stop working correctly, I weirdly see the potential of a pair of smart glasses that could be something functional. Could be, that is. Right now, the Even G2 and the Even R1 feel like a work in progress, like a lot of other smart glasses, and while the ideas are interesting, they’re just not as practical as they ought to be for the price they’re being sold. Maybe Even Realities can get the Even G2 and the Even R1 up to snuff with software updates and fixes to the Bluetooth bugs I experienced, but who knows what the future holds. Some Even G1 users were legitimately upset about the launch of the Even G2 since theyÂ had faith that Even Realities would refine its first-gen smart glasses before plowing ahead to a new pair. Obviously, that didn’t happen, and because of that, there’s no reason to think Even Realities won’t do the same thing with the Even G2. With that context and my firsthand experience, it’s hard to consider the Even G2 and the Even R1 as anything more than fairly nice hardware with some potential. If you’re willing to spend (checks notes) $600 on the smart glasses or $850 to also get the smart ring, then who am I to stop you? But if that potential doesn’t ultimately amount to much, you can’t say you haven’t been warned.

Title: Stocks stay on rollercoaster despite strong Nvidia earnings

By Lewis Krauskopf and Dhara Ranasinghe NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) -Nvidia Corp's strong earnings report offered only a brief reprieve from worries that have plagued stocks about the return on relentless artificial intelligence investment and lofty valuations on Wall Street. AI darling Nvidia on Wednesday surprised Wall Street with accelerating growth after several quarters of slowing sales and a fourth-quarter forecast that exceeded expectations. Initial relief across world stocks, however, turned sour on Thursday as investors refocused on the negatives that pulled the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite off record highs hit late last month. Investors also grappled with the delayed release of September payrolls data that solidified the belief that the Federal Reserve would not lower interest rates for a third straight meeting in December. "This is a coordinated risk off trade — tech stocks, crypto, etc on worries about valuations and leverage," said Nationwide Chief Market Strategist Mark Hackett. "The fact that it is an intraday decline rather than a drop at the open suggests exhaustion." Nvidia's upbeat results did not dispel concern around a fall back to earth for highly-valued tech stocks, amid lingering concerns about whether AI spending will pay off. Nvidia's results "are encouraging and support the AI story," said Angelo Kourkafas, senior global investment strategist at Edward Jones. "But ... I think there's broad skepticism over the next one-to-three years whether AI is going to be able to deliver on the return side." Global stocks have now dropped over 3% this month in part driven by concerns that a rally in tech shares has gone too far, too fast. "The concerns around tech will persist and each quarter we are likely to come across the same concerns as markets question the concentration," said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Global Investors in London. "That story won’t go away." Shah said that while she was overweight U.S. stocks, she was also wary of concentration risks and this was one reason why she was looking at European shares. AI COMPANY RESULTS AS IMPORTANT AS DATA PRINTS Investors and analysts say that as AI emerges as a so-called mega-trend, market sentiment hangs on earnings results from chipmaker Nvidia, a bellwether for the AI build-out, and other technology companies. They are as key to shaping views on the economic outlook as monthly economic releases. Nvidia's shares were down over 2% after rallying sharply in early trade. The S&P 500 was off 1.2% and the Nasdaq was down 1.7% after both had climbed sharply earlier. MSCI's index of global shares was off 0.7%. Morgan Stanley on Thursday said it scrapped its forecast that the Fed would cut interest rates by a quarter-point at its December meeting after the Labor Department released data showing a greater-than-expected 119,000 non-farm payrolls increase in September. The report was more than a month late due to the government shutdown. "It's a sense that the Fed is still driving in the fog and we're not going to get any support from monetary policy in the short term," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth. "I think that's been a larger influence (in the market today) than the questioning about AI valuations." "The positive here is the most speculative fringes of the market are getting a much-needed sell-off." Fed Governor Lisa Cook didn't help sentiment, saying that historically elevated prices in equities, corporate bonds, housing and leveraged-loan markets may portend a large pullback in valuations. AI, TECH STOCK CONCERNS REMAIN Thursday's action showed that investors need to brace for a bumpy ride. "Investors do need to worry about bubble risks," Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told reporters on a call about the 2026 outlook on Thursday. The so-called "Magnificent Seven" - including Nvidia and Meta - have seen their share prices soar over the past several years, fuelling fears about the scale of market exposure to just a few names. Technology firms are among the stock market's big fallers in recent days, although they are still well up on the year. The S&P 500 tech sector's forward price/earnings ratio - a measure of how much a company is worth compared to future earnings - was recently about 30 times, well above its 10-year average of 22.2. The AI stocks frenzy has drawn comparisons with the 1990s dotcom boom and bust, while concerns were rising about debt taken on by tech firms. Nvidia produced $60 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, David Trainer, CEO of investment research firm New Constructs, said in a note. To justify its current stock price, it would need to produce $2.1 trillion in annual cash flows within 10 years, he said. On Wednesday, speaking before the Nvidia results, Amundi, Europe's biggest asset manager, said it was underweight megacap stocks. While it had not sold down the stocks in most portfolios, it has been hedging with derivatives that give it the option to sell them instead, Amundi's CIO, Vincent Mortier, said.

Title: European stocks handed boost as amid Nvidia reporting

A wave of relief swept through European markets after Nvidia’s upbeat forecast eased concerns that artificial intelligence (AI) reliant stocks may have over elevated valuations amid analysts’ concerns. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.25 per cent to 12,024.30, lagging behind its European counterparts. Deutsche Bank upgraded insulation specialists Kingspan stock to ‘buy’ and it gained 1.98 per cent to reach €66.95. In a mixed day for the banks, Bank of Ireland gained 0.57 per cent to reach €15.055, AIB fell 0.36 per cent to hit €8.24, and PTSB was flat. Ryanair fell 1.02 per cent, a major component, it weighed down the index alongside fellow heavy-hitter, Kerry Group which shed 0.71 per cent. London The blue-chip FTSE 100 climbed 0.16, halting a five-day decline. The domestically focused FTSE 250 fell slightly to elongate its losing run. The aerospace and defence sector rebounded after a setback in the previous session. Industry heavyweights Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems both gained. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca advanced about 0.40 per cent after its drug to control growth of non-cancerous tumours was approved in the United States. Miniature war-games maker Games Workshop soared 13.49 per cent and hit a record high on strong half-year forecast. Johnson Matthey shares fell 3.35 per cent after the chemicals company said finance chief Richard Pike would take on a new role as chief operating officer. Sportswear retailer JD Sports fell 3.88 per cent after forecasting annual profit at the lower end of market expectations. Additionally, Friday’s UK retail sales figures will also be on investors’ radar to gauge the nation’s economic health, after this week’s data showed inflation easing for the first time in five months. Europe The pan-European Stoxx 600 index gained 0.49 per cent on Thursday with investors buoyed by positive Nvidia results. In company news, Novartis AG boosted its sales targets for two key cancer drugs, underscoring confidence in its oncology pipeline, but its stocks still fell 1.76 per cent. BNP Paribas SA announced a new buyback and plans to reach a target for capital strength early as chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe seeks to reverse a recent slide in the stock price. The bank’s stocks gained 4.40 per cent. A series of European defence companies gained ground in trading. German defence giant Rheinmetall AG added 2.57 per cent while BAE Systems gained 1.77 per cent. Siemens Energy announced its biggest share buyback since the turbine maker went public five years ago amid optimism around surging data-centre investments, and added 1.14 per cent. Stellantis traded more blows with BYD saying its Chinese partner Leapmotor is selling more electric vehicles in Europe’s biggest EV market. It fell 3.04 per cent. New York Wall Street’s main indexes advanced on Thursday, with technology stocks getting a boost after Nvidia’s stellar results quelled some concerns around an AI bubble, while a firm September jobs report showed signs of a resilient economy. Nvidia gained after the world’s most valuable company forecast sales above analysts’ estimates for the final three months of the year and surpassed expectations for third-quarter revenue. Chief executive Jensen Huang shrugged off concerns about AI on a call with analysts, saying: “We see something very different.” A year-long rally in high-flying technology stocks had begun to lose some steam as investors became increasingly cautious of a potential AI bubble. Concerns about monetisation prospects over the technology, circular spending within the sector and debt issuance have weighed on markets with the Nasdaq sharply off its October high and Nvidia down sharply from its peak. Most megacap and growth stocks advanced, with Alphabet up and Meta gaining. The S&P 500 tech index was among the gainers, with Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom and other chip-related stocks jumping. Walmart jumped after the retailer raised its annual forecast for the second time this year and also set a December date to change its stock listing to the Nasdaq from the NYSE. – Additional reporting: Reuters, PA Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: The lonely AI bear: Why one analyst just took the brave step of downgrading Amazon and Microsoft

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. One analyst has taken a dimmer view of two AI kingmakers this week. Alex Haissl, an analyst at Rothschild & Co Redburn, is a lonely dissenting voice among research analysts when it comes to shares of Amazon and Microsoft. In a note to clients this week, Haissl downgraded the firm's rating on the tech giants despite the ongoing hype for generative AI and the billions both firms have pledged to spend on the new tech in the coming years. Investors look like they're valuing Amazon and Microsoft's capex plans as "as if cloud-1.0 economics still applied," Haissl wrote, referring to the low-cost structure of cloud-based services that allowed Big Tech firms to boom in the 2010s. But there are a few problems that suggest the AI boom likely won't play out in the same way, and it is is probably far more costly than investors realize, he said. "We downgrade Amazon and Microsoft with a heavy heart," Haissl wrote, noting that the firm had held a bullish view on the two stocks for the last several years. "But after turning over every stone, we no longer see a credible path back to cloud 1.0 economics. The market, however, still prices in that outcome, implying returns we believe are no longer achievable," he added. There are key differences between the business model for "cloud 1.0" and generative AI, Haissl said. For one, AI is far more costly. According to Rothchild's analysis, a GPU costs firms around $40 billion in capex per gigawatt of power. It's also believed to generate less revenue. Each GPU generates around $10 billion of revenue per gigawatt, per the firm's calculations. Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Apple are on track to spend around $349 billion in capex this year, much of which is directed toward AI infrastructure, according to company statements. "We are not concerned about operating margins; those can be managed. The real constraint is the capex required relative to the growth delivered," Haissl said, later adding that he believed the market was overestimating the returns related to AI investment. Second, AI chips are also known to have a short lifespan, another factor that can make projects costly. If a GPU were to be replaced every three years, projects would turn "value destructive," according to Rothchild's estimates, implying losses for the owners of the chips. Third, hyperscalers have limited pricing power, Haissl said, pointing to the expenses associated with AI hardware, which is largely provided by tech startups. "Passing higher costs on to startups would simply deepen their losses unless those costs could be pushed through to end users; if not, hyperscaler economics deteriorate further," he said. Amazon and Microsoft already look like they're "re-rated meaningfully" in price, Haissl said, pointing to the recent declines in both stocks. Amazon shares are down around 13% from their peak in early November, while Microsoft shares are down 10% from their peak in late October. "While there may still be some upside to growth, we believe it is limited relative to buy-side expectations and, more importantly, less relevant given the low value of that growth," Haissl said. That's not to say the firm is turning completely negative on Amazon and Microsoft. It's hard to hash out a bear case for the near-term for these stocks, Haissl wrote, adding that the firm believed both would continue to post strong growth figures over the next year. "In our view, it is not a bear case — but it is no longer a bull case either," he said, adding that the firm would need to see high growth and a "meaningful reduction in capex" in order to turn more optimistic. It's a fragile time for the AI trade, with tech stocks sinking in recent weeks as investors take stock of high valuations and begin to doubt the billions being sown into AI-related investments. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 is down 6% from its high in late October. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF, which tracks the seven tech titans at the heart of the AI trade, is down 7% from its peak last month. Jump to

Title: Nvidia stock price today: Nvidia expected more, Nvidia delivered even more — Is AI bubble narrative fading?

Nvidia stock rose after the company delivered another huge earnings beat, with Q3 revenue topping $57 billion against expectations of about $55 billion. Data-center sales hit $51 billion, showing demand for AI chips is still accelerating. Adjusted earnings came in at $1.30 per share, above forecasts. The company said several Blackwell GPUs are sold out and guided Q4 revenue to nearly $65 billion, calming AI-bubble worries. Nvidia also modeled zero China revenue due to export rules but still signaled strong global demand, keeping investor momentum intact.

Written by: Kyle Prevost Back in the spring I wrote about AI investing in Canada, and why I was pretty cautious about advising anyone to invest in the AI bubble. Well, so far, youâd have been right to completely disregard that advice and go 100% in on AI stocks like Nvidia! That said, Iâve been doing quite a bit of AI Bubble related reading in the past couple of weeks, and Iâm more sure than ever that folks should be looking to at least partially diversify away from the tech craze and into low risk investments. Once again, itâs worth pointing out right upfront that while I believe the AI bubble is real and verifiable, I have no idea whether it will âpopâ tomorrow, in 6 months, or a year from now. As I write this, tech stocks have had several down days in a row, so itâs even possible that the AI bubble is deflating in real time! As someone who uses a large language model AI (LLM) every day, Iâm also quite familiar with the real productivity gains that AI offers. Investors need to understand that artificial intelligence can be both a game-changing technology AND that many companies who are involved in the AI space are completely overvalued based on their current earnings and profit potential. Every few years, markets decide that one idea will change everything. In 1999 it was the internet. In 2006 it was housing (and the ability to re-sell mortgage contracts). In 2017 it was crypto (for the first time). In 2021 it was SPACs and meme stocks. Heck, in 1636 it was Dutch tulips. In 2025 it is AI. Some of those stories were truly world changing. Some were just world entertaining. The investment results depended on what you paid for shares of specific companies, how patient you were, and how concentrated your investment portfolio became. Answering the question of if AI is the next stock market bubble first becomes a matter of properly defining what a bubble is. While there are many different definitions out there, Iâll go with: A stock market bubble is when share prices disconnect from realistic future cash flows for an extended period. Usually it is the result of a great story, speculation over âeasy moneyâ to be made, and fear of missing out. One of my favourite Canadian commentators over at The Plain Bagel likes to frame it as: narrative running ahead of numbers. Most investment bubbles are not like the Dutch tulip crisis. Railroads did transform commerce. But itâs also true that speculation on railroad stocks also caused several massive stock market bubbles to form. Electricity did completely change day-to-day life. The internet did reshape business. Early investors who recognized those truths were not wrong. They were just often early, over-concentrated, or paying too high a price for shares of a specific company – even though there could be substantial future growth. Hereâs a brief look at the reasons I think the AI hype bubble is real – and why there are likely to be some very disappointed investors who are currently getting into the market. As always, check with your Canadian financial advisor before taking anyoneâs free thoughts on investing! 1) AI company valuations are very high. As I write this article, the cyber defence company named Planatir has a price-to-earnings ratio of over 400x. To put it mildlyâ¦ thatâs insane. By comparison, our best Canadian dividend stocks generally come in at 15-20x these days (and even that is somewhat high historically). Canadaâs biggest company – Shopify – isnât a pure AI stock, but itâs certainly tied to that world. It has a P/E ratio of about 100x. In order to live up to these crazy high future profit expectations, the companies will have to grow their revenue to insanely-high levels – and do that while keeping expenses low. The probability of being able to achieve that lofty outcome has to be less than 10% historically speaking. Aswath Damodaran and Scott Galloway are two prominent commentators that have repeatedly asserted that the AI hype story being told about these companies doesnât match the actual profit numbers being generated. I agree with the assertion that medium- and long-term profit potential just doesnât justify these wild valuations. 2) Concentration risk. A handful of mega caps explain an outsized share of market returns. We saw this in the Nifty Fifty era and the Dot Com run up. When breadth narrows and indices rely on a tiny cohort, you are fine until you are not. Right now, the five largest US stocks make up about 37% of the S&P 500 (meaning they are like 25% of the entire worldâs market cap). If you were to buy $100-worth of a Canadian all-in-one ETF (see our XEQT Review for more details) about $9.40 would be going to just three companies (Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft). You toss in a few more tech companies like Amazon, Shopify, Broadcom, Meta (Facebook), and Tesla – and now weâre talking more like $16.00.Â 3) Capex arms race is unsustainable. The tech ecosystem is currently spending staggering sums on GPUs, data centers, and power. That is great for the picks and shovels layer (Nvidia being the 800-pound gorilla in the proverbial room) while the virtual gold rush lasts. It becomes an issue when supply catches up and returns on incremental investment start to compress. Eventually, investors are going to get sick of burning money with no end in sight. Another capex issue is that those GPUs arenât like railway tracks – they will need to be replaced every 3-5 years. This will present a significant obstacle to ever realizing profits! 4) Copy & paste AI everywhere. With powerhouses like China putting out free open source AI applications such as Deep Seek, itâs doubtful that there will be many companies able to maintain large profit margins over the long term. Without those thick profit margins, the case for the high valuations goes south in a hurry. China is producing energy much much cheaper than we are in the West. Thatâs going to be a major AI input and choke point – so tell me again why Western AI companies are going to be so massively profitable? 5) FOMO marketing. From themed ETFs to viral threads, the sampling error of social media is large. Only the home runs get shared. Survivorship bias takes over. Kyla Scanlon is one of my favourite economic commentators (sheâs probably most famous for coining the term âvibe-sessionâ) has been clear about how emotions (aka: vibes) drive capital flows in the short term. There are very few emotional pulls out there stronger than the fear of missing out (FOMO). 6) Historical rhyme. The pattern looks familiar. Real tech, real adoption, valuations that start reasonable and drift into narratives that do not allow for normal business cycles. We have seen this movie (literally in the case of The Big Short). This Bloomberg graphic of the current AI supply chain and the money loops that keep it spinning really caught my eye recently. Note: The circle size roughly tracks market value. The colours show relationship types: who sells hardware or software, who provides cloud services, who is investing cash or venture capital. In the middle you see the four big hubs that everything flows through right now: OpenAI, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Oracle. Around them are chip makers and up-and-comers like AMD, Intel, CoreWeave, xAI, Mistral, Figure, and a handful of AI application startups. The picture says two things at once: the AI boom is highly interconnected, and a small number of firms sit at the choke points. The biggest arrows in the chart call out a few headline deals. Reports say OpenAI and Oracle struck a gigantic multiyear cloud agreement tied to Project Stargate, described as roughly 4.5 gigawatts of new data-center capacity and summarized by some outlets as about 300 billion dollars over five years, while the Financial Times framed it as about 30 billion dollars per year to lease capacity for 4.5 GW. Another set of arrows shows OpenAIâs pact with AMD: OpenAI plans to deploy up to 6 GW worth of AMD Instinct GPUs and received warrants or an option to buy up to 10 percent of AMD stock (about 160 million shares) as milestones are met. Nvidia shows up as both a supplier and an investor, with coverage describing a plan to invest up to 100 billion dollars in OpenAI, while Oracle, CoreWeave, and others are shown spending tens of billions on Nvidia chips to build out AI cloud capacity. Iâd argue the graphic makes the industry look like a circular money machine: vendors invest in customers who then commit to buy the vendorsâ products, sometimes with âup toâ figures, milestone triggers, or non-binding frameworks that will only convert if financing, power, and permitting line up. This diagram is either the blueprint to which companies will massively benefit from AI – or itâs a snapshot of a house of cards where power is concentrated in very few hands, and outside ecosystem revenue is counted on many different balance sheets. The prudent approach is to watch what shows up in financial filings over the next few quarters. Iâm looking at these questions specifically: 1) How much of Oracleâs cloud backlog converts to recognized revenue from OpenAI? 2) How AMD discloses any warrant exercises or dilution tied to OpenAI milestones? 3) Does Nvidiaâs alleged OpenAI investment actually close or is more of a âframework of a planâ? Now, to be fair, there are absolutely some good arguments that artificial intelligence is the real deal, and that it deserves all the hype and invested money. To be clear, I donât find this side of the debate as compelling, but itâs not like there isnât some solid rationale here. 1) Revenue is following the hype in some places. LLMs like ChatGPT are showing quickly increasing revenues. Some companies might have near-monopoly-style advantages for a while because of scale, talent, and ecosystem power. Google and Facebook have made headlines for paying AI engineers professional baseball-level salaries as trillions of dollars in infrastructure spending justify paying nearly any amount for top talent. 2) Unit economics are improving. Token costs, inference optimization, and model efficiency keep getting better. The more people use AI, the better it should get. (Itâs worth pointing out that Chinaâs token costs are substantially lower than the American AI giantsâ cost right now.) 3) Companies are using AI. Many CIOs are rolling AI into concrete workflows where ROI is measurable. AI isnât just for kids cheating on homework. Paying fewer employees means increased profits. 4) Policy tailwinds. It could certainly be argued that while many governments around the world are pro-AI, the Trump government in particular seems willing to give the big tech CEOs more or less whatever they want at this point. They also want semiconductor supply onshore, resilient electricity grids, and data security. Scanlon has written extensively about how the AI-powered stock market is absolutely essential to confidence in the government. This has created a mutually-reinforcing cycle for the industry. 5) Not all investment multiples are crazy. There are profitable, cash rich companies tied to AI trading at premiums, sure, but not face melting ones relative to their recent growth. That is different from 1999. The dot-com companies had very little profits and borrowed a ton of money. Google, Microsoft, Meta, et. al are cash-rich companies that can soak up a lot of losses due to their gobbling of the entire advertising world over the last couple of decades. New technologies tend to follow S curves as they diffuse into the real world. Slow early adoption. A sharp middle spike once the tech is proven. Then a long flattening as the efficiencies are gradually found implemented. Investors tend to project the steep middle forever. That is where bubbles live. Scanlonâs read is that we are in the middle of that S curve emotionally, while physically we are still building the plumbing. Power, compute, and data center capacity have to catch up to the hype. I honestly am not sure that they ever will! There are increasing stories about big chip data centres sitting dark because utilities canât book up the electrical grid to them. With electricity prices going through the roof in some areas, there will be considerable political pressure to address the issue. When you consider the Chinese competitive advantage here, the situation gets even more muddled. That is consistent with Damodaranâs reminder that growth, margins, and reinvestment are linked. If you want to grow faster, you have to feed the beast. That usually dents margins until scale efficiency shows up. No matter what else one believes about the AI bubble, one staggering truth is that there has never been a company like Nvidia. The combination of incredibly-quick risking revenues combined with a massive profit margin (although slowly shrinking as others catch up) makes this company an absolute juggernaut. However – at some point, the price becomes too high – even for a juggernaut. Nvidia is different from the companies like Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic, in that they donât have to invent uses for AI or make AI better in order to make money. They are the proverbial picks and shovels sellers to the AI gold rush. Obviously the more gold that is âfound in them there hillsâ the more picks and shovels will be needed. But for now, as long as the biggest companies in the world (American tech companies) continue to buy Nvidia chips as fast as they can make them, the company can basically print money. And theyâre printing A LOT of money! Nvidia just released results from another monster quarter. (Unlike OpenAI Nvidia is a publicly-traded company, so they have to release their financials every 3 months.) Revenue came in at about $57.0B vs $54.9B expected, with EPS beating predictions as well. Management said cloud GPUs are effectively sold out. So, how can a company that is making like $30 billion in annual profits (and quickly growing) be in a bubble?! This isnât exactly Pets.com weâre talking about here! Letâs quickly look at two realities to determine if the Nvidia AI bubble story has legs: Multiples: Nvidiaâs trailing P/E sits around 53 today. That headline number is going to swing a lot this year because both the numerator (price) and the denominator (earnings) are moving fast. Even if you prefer forward P/E (around 28x), the key is not the exact digit. Itâs the path of earnings that has to keep compounding at an extraordinary clip for this valuation to make sense. That is possible when you are the toll road for a once-in-a-generation buildout. It is also how bubbles form when expectations outrun physics or budgets. Scale: Nvidiaâs market cap has been hovering in the multi-trillion range in late 2025, briefly topping $5 trillion. Thatâs an impossibly-large number to wrap your heads around. For context, the entire Canadian stock market is worth about $3.6 trillion. That includes all of the Canadian Dividend Kings (think about all the pipelines, all the railways tracks, all the banks, etc)! Nvidiaâs market cap is bigger than Germany and Australiaâs combined! Thatâs just wild to think about. Thatâs a huge price to pay – even for a company that is printing money! Back to the fundamentals. A few details from the latest update matter for valuation: So is Nvidia ultimately in a bubble? Nvidiaâs earnings justify a premium so long as AI capex keeps compounding and Nvidia is able to maintain their massive cutting edge advantage. The moment the buildout slows or other companies begin to eat away at Nvidiaâs market share, the multiple will compress first and the narrative will follow. That is how every hot-growth cycle cools off. I definitely like the short- and medium-term math behind Nvidia more than I do the newer AI companies. The huge companies in the US such as Meta and Google have committed to buying massive amounts of chips in the next few years. I donât see any reason why that wonât happen. Beyond that thoughâ¦ the stock is currently priced for the incredible growth story to continue for many years. Thatâs a super-tall order. Letâs say Nvidia maybe isnât a bubble compared to some of the other froth out thereâ¦ but itâs definitely not underpriced! For many many companies, weâd use publicly-available information to determine if they were in a bubble. But without sales and profit numbers, itâs impossible to âsee under the hoodâ and know what anyone is paying for equity in a company – let alone if thatâs a good deal. OpenAI isnât a publicly traded company, so they donât have to release their latest numbers anywhere. Just to clarify, that means if you login into your online brokerage account, you wonât be able to find an OpenAI ticker anywhere. Thereâs also no real-time way to determine the value of a company like there is when you have a handy stock ticker moving up and down. That said, there are a few clues we can use to give us some big picture answers. Private-market marks have moved wildly in 2025. Reuters reported in July that OpenAI was exploring a primary raise at roughly a $300 billion valuation, off the back of enterprise growth and rising ChatGPT revenue. A few months later, Bloomberg and the Financial Times both wrote that a secondary sale cleared at an even higher ~$500 billion headline valuation, which tells you how frothy late-stage demand has been this year. Treat these as guideposts, not gospel. Different deal structures, preferences, and timing can put two very different price tags on the same company. Many market watchers believe that if OpenAI went public today, it would have a valuation of close to $1 trillion (all numbers USD). As the hilarious show Silicon Valley taught us years ago in this NSFW clip, tech companies donât want to show a profit. If they show a profit, then guys like me put a P/E ratio on it (like I did with Palantir at the start of this article) and say itâs in a bubble. But as long as you never make money, then you can cash in on the dream of endless potential! It will likely be a very very long time before OpenAI makes a profit – and yet somehow itâs worth between $500 billion and a trillion dollars?! Reuters reported that OpenAI had revenues of âmore than $10 billionâ in mid-2025 and said management was targeting roughly $12.7 billion for full-year 2025. Thatâs a massive jump from late-2024 snapshots. Recently the company has claimed that it is running ahead of those numbers. That said, when asked directly about revenues and massive losses for the next few years, CEO Sam Altman walked off of Brad Gerstnerâs âEnoughâ podcast. Not a great look. The Wall Street Journal has been blunt about the math: even with revenue compounding, capital spending and compute costs are dramatically outpacing sales. Training and buying new GPU models is a furnace that eats cash and electricity (and will in perpetuity from what we can see). That makes sustainable gross margins and capacity planning the whole ball game.The Financial Times added another cold-water stat this fall â profitability for OpenAI isnât expected until around 2029. So is OpenAI in a bubble? The honest answer is that you canât buy it directly so itâs impossible to know for sure. Instead weâre stuck looking in Microsoftâs quarterly reports for clues (as they own a large chunk of OpenAI). What we can say is that OpenAI isnât making any money this year. Or next year. Or maybe for the next 10 years. But for that potential to make a lot of money one day in the future, private investors are willing to pay $500 billion today. Sounds like a probable-bubble to me, but what do I know? Scanlon has pointed out that OpenAI can be world-changing and over-valued at the same time. The credible path out of âbubbleâ territory is kind of a boring grey area. It would go something along the lines of more enterprise sales, a more clear gap between ChatGPT and other LLMs, model cadence that doesnât blow up serving costs, and a clear plan to control electricity and chip costs. âThis time is differentâ – famous last words when discussing the stock market. AI is a general purpose technology. It will help many companies increase their profits. That means that it is a valuable new invention – but it doesnât guarantee that specific companies will generate profits from it. Airplanes were an incredible invention that greatly improved productivity around the world. Yet very few airlines have ever managed sustainable profits. Itâs worth noting here that Nvidia is worth about 4.5x what the entire aviation industry is worth (if we assume that the IATAâs estimate is correct – with Delta airlines being the biggest in the world at about $40 billion, compared to Nvidiaâs $4 trillion+ valuation). Electricity, railways, telecommunications, the internet – all major game changers that allowed companies to make more money. All of them generated investment bubbles. These are practical signals, not trading calls. 1) Watch OpenAI closely. Any sign of shakiness there is going to be somewhat hidden – but when uncovered, itâs going to rapidly affect that entire circular diagram we mentioned earlier. 2) If China proves to be better at AI – or even just competitive in certain areas of AI – then these American companies arenât worth nearly what theyâre priced at. If China competes at something, prices go down. Period.3) Do we have enough electricity for these data centres? Letâs see how politicians respond. 4) Watch the boring regular companies. If Coke or Barrick or Enbridge start to scale back on AI spending because theyâve already squeezed all the juice they can out of it – then those falling sales numbers will quickly filter up the AI food chain. Look, if I knew how big the AI bubble was (and could somehow quantify exactly the appropriate price for these companies) AND when the bubble would pop – then we could all be multi-millionaires together. We could buy options and make a sequel to The Big Short. (I think Channing Tatum would be the obvious choice to play yours truly.) The truth is that we donât really yet know what this technology will eventually look like – let alone which companies will get the thickest profit margins from it. What we do know is that the current prices of the stocks indicate people believe an absolute best case scenario is about to occur. I think itâs fair to say rebalancing your portfolio, or deciding to take some risk off the table is likely a good move at the moment. Low risk investments such as high interest savings accounts or GICs can appropriately balance risk alongside appropriate levels of risk taking in the stock market. You can check out our EQ Bank review for more details on where I am currently getting the best interest rates. That said – is it possible that the Nasdaq could go up another 20% before it sees a correction? Sure. Iâd say itâs more likely weâll see it 30% off the highs than up 20% from the highs, but one has to be aware that in the short-term, the stock market is more âanimal spiritsâ driven than it is a sober price marking machine. Long-term, I have more confidence that all possible information will get priced in, and valuations will likely come back down to Earth. No. Take a look at our list of the Best ETFs in Canada. Forget niche themed ETFs. If you have to ask, it is probably too much. My rule of thumb is that a single stock should not be the reason your retirement plan fails. Size accordingly. If youâre an index investor, Nvidia and other AI stocks are likely already a massive part of your portfolio. If you are optimizing, US listed ETFs in the RRSP avoid US withholding tax on dividends. Most of these companies donât pay a lot of dividends anyway, so itâs not a huge deal. Not directly. If you own broad US indexes, you already have some exposure via Microsoft. I wish I had a better answer, but the undeniable truth is that timing is hard. As far as I can tell, we are almost certainly in a mild to moderate AI stock bubble – and itâs occurring alongside a very real productivity wave. Both predictions/observations can be true. Letâs anchor this statement to two old-school yardsticks. First, the Shiller CAPE. As of early fall 2025, several trackers put the U.S. CAPE north of 40, which is rarified air and well above the long-run average (which is high teens). Weâre not at the dot-comâs peak of ~44, but we’re in the same neighbourhood. That tells you prices already assume weâre going to see mega profits (and sooner rather later). Second, the Buffett Indicator (defined by the total market cap of the companies in the USA divided by GDP). The idea is that the total worth of all the companies should be somewhat tied to the size and growth of the broader economy. Makes sense to me! The long-term average for the Buffett Indicator is 80-100%. Right now the market is priced at 220%. Itâs probably no coincidence that Buffettâs current investment portfolio includes a massive lump of cash. Obviously thereâs more room to go down than up judging by these metrics. Now to the question Scott Galloway keeps raising: What happens to the whole market if everyone gets fired? The short version is that cost cuts can boost margins for a while, but you cannot fire your way to durable growth. For valuations to make sense, you need both margin gains and real revenue growth. Company-level layoffs also ricochet through the economy by lowering aggregate demand, which in turn pressures the same revenue lines investors are modeling up and to the right. Gallowayâs broader point on AI exuberance is that narratives are running ahead of unit economics, and that the last leg of a mania often leans on imagined efficiencies that cannot scale across every firm at once. Could the AI bubble inflate further? Absolutely. As Keynes used to say, âThe market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.â That fundamental truth makes it very difficult to predict how big the bubble can get and deciding when it will pop. While guys like Michael Burry are out there making short bets against stocks, I donât recommend anyone try it at home. Could the entire AI industry also slowly deflate into a long, sideways grind while earnings catch up over the next two decades? That boring outcome happens more often than headlines would have you believe (just ask Cisco). If you came here for a bold call, I apologize. I am not ready to put my flag in the ground on the exact month an AI bubble will peak. What I can say with conviction is that great technologies and bubbly valuations often travel together. The technology can win while many excited investors lose. The way to avoid being on the wrong side of that sentence is to own enough of the winners through low cost index investing, limit your concentrated bets, and keep adding money even when the headlines are dramatic. As The Plain Bagel likes to remind us, markets eventually weigh cash flows, not adjectives. As Damodaran would insist, you still have to tie the story to profit numbers at some point. If AI does half of what its boosters promise, productivity will rise, costs will fall, and your diversified portfolio will benefit. But if it ONLY does half of what it promises, then the AI bubble is going to mean tech stock prices come down (whether itâs slowly or all at once). At the moment the best AI in the world canât draw a clockâ¦ so Iâm keeping my expectations in check. Sign up below to get a copy of our free eBook: Can I Retire Yet? Thanks for subscribing!

Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest bought over $39 million in Bullish, Circle and BitMine shares as crypto stocks dipped, signaling conviction amid market weakness. Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest increased its exposure to crypto-related stocks on Wednesday, purchasing Bullish, Circle Internet Group and BitMine Immersion Technologies across multiple exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as crypto stocks slid deeper into the red. According to ARK’s daily trade disclosure, the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (ARKF) bought 48,011 shares of Bullish, while the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW) added 92,670 shares. The ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) made the largest move of the group, purchasing 322,917 shares of Bullish, bringing the total to $16.8 million. ARK followed this with sizeable buys of Circle, the company behind the USDC (USDC) stablecoin. ARKF picked up 22,327 shares and ARKW snapped up 43,174, while ARKK added 150,518 shares, acquiring around $15 million worth of shares in the stablecoin issuer. ARK also added BitMine shares. ARKF purchased 26,923 shares, and ARKW added 51,954. ARKK accumulated the single largest amount at 181,774 shares, bringing the total amount to $7.6 million. Related: ARK Invest resumes crypto buying spree, adds BitMine and Bullish shares The buying came as crypto-exposed stocks broadly weakened as the crypto market continues to retreat from October highs. Bullish fell 3.63% on the day to $36.39, continuing its recent slide before recovering slightly in after-hours trading. Circle closed the session down nearly 9% at $69.72. BitMine finished the day down 9.5% at $29.18, though it recovered more than 6% after hours. Michael Saylor-led Bitcoin treasury firm Strategy was hit even harder, dropping 9.82% on the day before recovering some losses in the after-hours. Notably, ARK has been on a crypto buying spree over the past week amid tumbing crypto prices. On Monday, the firm purchased $10.2 million worth of BitMine shares as its stock price slid to a new record low. Related: Cathie Wood’s ARK Invest adds BitMine shares as it offloads $30M in Tesla stock As Cointelegraph reported, Nvidia delivered another blockbuster quarter on Wednesday, posting $57 billion in revenue and $31.9 billion in profit, both well above Wall Street expectations. The chip maker also issued a strong fourth-quarter revenue forecast of $65 billion, easing weeks of market anxiety over whether AI demand was starting to cool.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.

Title: Meta Never Bought Monopoly Power, It Simply Discovered The Future

ByJohn Tamny, Contributor. “This is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard – and you’ll never be heard from again.” That’s what Michael Ovitz, long known as the most powerful man in Hollywood, told Barry Diller when the former head of both Paramount and Fox informed Ovitz of his next act in business. It was the early 1990s, and Diller sensed the future was in screens “interacting with customers.” Diller sought and achieved control over the Home Shopping Network. Media types were aghast! Diller’s time in the proverbial wilderness rates thought as you read this, and you contemplate the meaning of the dismissal of the FTC’s case against Meta. The FTC filed suit against Meta on December 8, 2020 based on Meta’s prior purchases of Instagram ($1 billion) and WhatsApp ($19 billion) in 2012 and 2014 respectively. But if there had been strong evidence in 2012 and 2014 that Meta was buying monopoly power, then the latter would have revealed itself through exponentially higher price tags for both Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s really that simple. That they both could be purchased for a fraction of their present worth is all the evidence we need that as opposed to buying monopoly control of the social media sector, Meta (Facebook at the time) was taking on substantial, possibly existential risk with its purchases. Leaps into the future are expensive, and shareholders not infrequently revolt if they’re wrong. Which brings us to Meta’s share price 15 and 13 years ago. It was higher in November of 2012 (it closed the month at $28) than it was after the purchase of Instagram ($26.81) in December of 2012. As for WhatsApp, Meta shares were down $1 a month after the purchase, and $10 by the following month. Markets are a look ahead, but as evidenced by the share-price movement of Meta after it added Instagram and WhatsApp to its suite of free offerings for users, neither impressed investors. It’s a reminder that it took the information-pregnant marketplace a long time to reward Facebook’s vision. Which is telling. The crucial truth revealed through Meta’s stock price is that Facebook couldn’t have known it was purchasing monopoly power, let alone businesses that would subsequently exceed their purchase price worth, simply because no one knew. In business, tomorrow is another century. Which similarly requires thought as this opinion piece inches toward its conclusion. It was on November 30, 2022 that a little known (at least to the public) non-profit organization called OpenAI released ChatGPT, and in doing so, profoundly changed the present and future of Silicon Valley. Since then, Meta, once thought to be a “monopoly,” has invested hundreds of billions in a frenzied attempt to yet again discover a future that changes all the time based on developments in the present. It’s yet another reminder that in Silicon Valley, there are no monopoly purchases as is. There’s just investment in an ever-changing future that’s impossible to accurately foresee. This truth seems to have informed the court proceedings in the FTC’s dismissed lawsuit against Meta. Back to Ovitz and Diller, somewhere they’re nodding their heads in agreement. Foolish as Diller’s acquisition of HSN looked at the time, it proved a vehicle for him to become a billionaire internet entrepreneur though 155 different transactions over the years whereby much disdained HSN became the much revered IAC, or InterActiveCorp. Once briefly ridiculed, Diller is now lionized. In our dynamic economy there’s no buying dominance or “monopoly,” there’s just intrepid leaps into the future. That’s what Meta successfully did in risky fashion, thus the wise dismissal of the FTC’s lawsuit.

Title: Michael Burry drops new AI bubble warning, and this time it comes with a Lord of the Rings meme

Michael Burry is warning of an AI bubble, pointing to a chart showing U.S. capex-to-GDP ratios hitting levels last seen before the dot-com and housing crashes. He says tech capex is rising at double-digit rates while AI stocks sit near record highs, a pattern where markets peak before spending does. His Lord of the Rings meme mocks investor complacency. Burry has reportedly taken large put positions against Nvidia and Palantir and even deregistered Scion, signaling he expects inflated AI valuations, excess capacity, and margin risks to trigger a correction.

Title: European shares stabilise as investors await Nvidia report

Global shares stabilised somewhat on Wednesday as investors awaited Nvidia’s earnings report after the markets closed in the US, an update that analysts say could set the tone for the rest of 2025. Dublin Recovering some of Tuesday’s 2.3 per cent slide, the Iseq index closed up 1.5 per cent, outperforming other European indices. Bank stocks rallied and regained some momentum. AIB advanced by 1.7 per cent to close at €8.27 per share. Bank of Ireland finished the session at €14.97 per share, some 0.5 per cent higher, while PTSB added 0.3 per cent to close at €3.20. Home builders Cairn Homes and Glenveagh added 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per cent to finish off at €1.92 and €1.82 respectively as the latest property price index showed Irish house price inflation continuing to hover around the 8 per cent mark in September. Europe European shares were largely unchanged after hovering near a more than one-month low for a time on Wednesday. Both the blue-chip Stoxx 50 index and the pan-European Stoxx 600 advanced by just 0.1 per cent, with the latter coming off its single biggest daily drop in more than three months on Tuesday. European tech stocks declined and then rebounded somewhat in advance of Nvidia’s all-important earnings report that could stoke or soothe investor worries about sky-high tech valuations. AI hardware maker Schneider Electric finished 0.3 per cent higher, while Siemens added 0.2 per cent and chipmaker ASML surged 2.4 per cent in choppy trading. Meanwhile, Kering lost 3.2 per cent after the luxury company’s boss Luca de Meo said a return to growth will require reducing its reliance on struggling flagship Gucci, according to a memo seen by Reuters. London The UK’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index slid for a fifth consecutive session, losing 0.4 per cent, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 was little changed at closing bell. UK inflation slowed down for the first time since May in October, offering relief to the Labour Party government before next week’s annual budget and boosting the chance of a rate cut by the Bank of England. Consumer-focused stocks like Unilever, up 0.4 per cent, put a floor under the declines. British American Tobacco, meanwhile, jumped by more than 1 per cent while JD Sports added 4.4 per cent and Primark owner Associated British Foods moved 0.8 per cent higher. Bank stocks dragged on the index, however, with Barclays, NatWest and Lloyds logging losses of between 0.1 per cent and 1.6 per cent. New York Wall Street stabilised on Wednesday in advance of the Nvidia report, clawing back some ground lost during the earlier sell-off this week as investors repositioned their AI and tech bets. The Nasdaq Composite moved 0.6 per cent higher, the S&P 500 advanced by 0.3 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Chipmaker Nvidia climbed 2 per cent, leaving shares of the most important stock on Wall Street down almost 9 per cent this month. The AI darling has come to represent the nascent artificial intelligence technology that has powered much of the stock market’s rally in recent months. Its quarterly results and forward guidance will be scrutinised to determine how much life remains in the AI boom and whether worries over inflated valuations and a potential AI bubble are warranted. A basket tracking the Magnificent Seven stocks, including Apple and Meta, advanced 0.9 per cent. Alphabet surged as much as 7 per cent, its biggest gain since September, amid a wave of glowing reviews of the new version of its Gemini AI model. Target slipped 0.1 per cent after the retail giant trimmed its profit forecast for the year. Home improvement company Lowe’s jumped nearly 5 per cent after reporting profit that topped expectations on a pickup in online sales and growth in demand from professional contractors. – Additional reporting: Reuters, Bloomberg Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Nvidia shares set for $300bn swing around high-stakes earnings

Nvidia investors are bracing for a roughly $300 billion (€260 billion) swing in market value following quarterly results on Wednesday, amid rising unease over Silicon Valley’s vast spending on artificial intelligence. Options markets imply traders are expecting the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker’s share price to move by an average of 6.4 per cent in either direction when markets open on Thursday, equivalent to a gain or loss of about $280 billion in value. Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company at the end of October but since then has been caught up in a sharp stock market sell-off led by big AI players that has dragged the chipmaker’s shares down 11 per cent. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist, said: “The angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable.” The California-based company’s critical role in the AI boom means its results have in recent years heavily influenced the direction and mood of the broader tech-dominated US stock market. Wednesday’s results arrive as investors’ enthusiasm for the AI boom appears to be on the wane, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down more than 4 per cent over the past five sessions. [ Concerns mounting that we are well into market-bubble territoryOpens in new window ] Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have been among those hardest hit by the recent bout of selling, with Meta down 19 per cent and Oracle down 20 per cent over the past month. Mike Zigmont, co-head of trading at Visdom Investment Group, said: “In the run-up to Nvidia’s earnings announcement, we’re experiencing cold feet and worry that prices went too high to justify.” “If Nvidia delivers disappointing guidance Wednesday, the [market] is going to sink significantly,” he added. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue of about $55.5 billion on Wednesday, according to Visible Alpha data, above the company’s prior guidance in August of roughly $54 billion. The company is also expected to forecast its revenue for the current quarter, which analysts estimate will be about $62 billion, up roughly 58 per cent year-on-year. Nvidia has consistently beaten predictions over recent quarters, ratcheting up expectations that it will outperform again. Chief executive Jensen Huang in October announced the company had secured $500 billion in revenue for the next five quarters, at the high end of Wall Street estimates, helping the company temporarily surpass a record $5 trillion market valuation. Nvidia has been buffeted by volatile trade relations between China and the US this year. A rally in its shares last month was boosted by hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough. But the future of its AI chip sales in China remains uncertain, caught between US export controls and a push from Beijing to build more chips at home. Nvidia has in recent months signed multibillion-dollar deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, outside investors and rival tech groups to build data centres that use its chips to run AI models. Analysts have drawn attention to the circularity of some of these agreements, which often involve suppliers, investors and customers of the same handful of companies. Big Tech groups have also recently made greater use of public and private debt markets to fund their spending on AI infrastructure, which they had previously largely paid for with cash. Nvidia and Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic, whose chatbot Claude is a major competitor to OpenAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Inside the California 'AI factory' that showcases the contradiction at the heart of the tech race
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgvynlxqdyo
Time Published: 2025-11-19T13:52:41Z
Full Content:
Google's ultra-private CEO Sundar Pichai is showing me around Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun. But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. "AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on," he insists. "It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions." But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a "sudden correction" in global financial markets, saying "market valuations appear stretched" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that "there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now". Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: "I think no company is going to be immune, including us." So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these "inflection points": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. "Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence." But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is "palpably exciting" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: "It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… "So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this." Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: "restricted". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term "AI factories" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: "I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: "If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough." He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. "I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies," he said. But he also said: "What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure." Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. "I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true," he told me. "Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it." But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: "truth matters". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? "I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. "You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy," he adds. "I think that will have consequences." Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.

Title: AI Slop Has Turned Social Media Into an Antisocial Wasteland

Commentary: Platforms that once helped us stay in touch have become fractured and impersonal -- and AI slop and deepfakes are making it so much worse. Social media is becoming more unbearable, thanks to AI. Social media has never been lauded for realism, but online deceit is reaching a fever pitch. Since the inception of platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, aspirational content has flooded our feeds with too-perfect bodies, homes and lifestyles. Despite the supposed aim of social media to keep us connected, going online increasingly feels isolating and detached from reality. AI slop and deepfakes are making it infinitely worse. The emergence of generative AI tools like OpenAI's Sora, Google's Veo and Midjourney has facilitated the creation of videos that are all at once extraordinary, imaginative and deceptive. Suddenly, a simple text prompt can conjure anything you think up. It's a technological marvel, and, oftentimes, an ethical nightmare. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. AI slop refers to the endless barrage of low-quality digital content created with artificial intelligence. You've likely seen examples of this on your social media feeds, from videos of animals exhibiting oddly human characteristics to pranks and gags that seem to defy the laws of physics. In addition, deepfakes of public figures, both alive and dead, saying and doing things that never actually happened have become a hot -- and contentious -- commodity. It's not just shoddy AI that's diminishing the online experience. Filtering through more convincing fabrications of people, places and events demands more vigilance than ever, and it's utterly exhausting. Ever since the rollout of OpenAI's Sora app in September, I've wondered why anyone would want to scroll through a feed made up solely of artificial moments. Even more "traditional" social platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become inundated with AI content that seemingly serves no real purpose, beyond demonstrating the astonishingly lifelike imagery that AI tools can now conjure in an instant. Isn't the point of social media to stay in touch with people you know and to follow public figures that interest you? Is that foundational objective officially dead? "The cynical answer is that social media is now aimed at keeping you connected to the tool, rather than to each other," said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of Cornell Tech's Security, Trust and Safety Initiative. Tech giants are "making their stock price go up" by showing off their AI capabilities, he said, but "it's coming at the expense of the experience on these platforms." Indeed, that heightened artificiality clashes with the authenticity many of us seek and increasingly struggle to find online. One of the reasons I fell in love with TikTok years ago is that it's easier to find more genuine, unfiltered content -- a welcome relief from the overly polished influencer posts flooding my Instagram feed, although I increasingly see my fair share of that on TikTok, too. Even before the rise of generative AI, Instagram updates from friends and family have largely been supplanted by content from high-profile creators I don't follow. That's not always a bad thing, as it often exposes me to topics I want to see more of. That focus on user interests is what makes TikTok's algorithm in particular so powerful (and addictive). But it makes me feel even more disconnected from the people I actually do know -- especially since everyday folks are seemingly posting less nowadays. Factor AI into that equation, and any semblance of authenticity fades away. Now, along with battling feelings of insecurity from seeing touched-up images of real people, you may also stumble upon vacation photos that are entirely AI-generated, or come across an AI influencer that amplifies unattainable beauty standards. "Before, we had the problem of unrealistic body expectations," Mantzarlis said. "And now we're facing the world of unreal body expectations." It's becoming harder for people to separate fact from fiction, but the dissemination of slop and deepfakes isn't slowing down. The clock is ticking for platforms to regulate this new wave of content before it drowns out our sense of reality. Social media companies like Meta and TikTok have pledged to label AI-generated content and ban harmful posts such as fake crisis events or the use of private individuals' likenesses without their permission. On Wednesday, TikTok said it'll start testing a new control for people to choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their feeds. Pinterest rolled out a similar feature last month. But in the absence of government regulation -- which is lagging due to factors like political gridlock over how to regulate AI, lobbying from tech firms (Meta recently launched a super PAC to push back on AI laws) and the rapid rate at which the technology is evolving -- it's up to companies to uphold their own policies. It can admittedly be tricky for sites to flag everything given the sheer volume of content, but so far, their perfunctory efforts don't seem very promising. That lack of regulation can magnify distrust and discord online. An August study by Raptive, a media company that works with digital creators, found that when people merely suspected content was AI-generated, they instinctively distanced themselves from it. Specifically, 48% of respondents found the content to be less trustworthy, while 60% said they felt a lower emotional connection to it. But with influencer-created content dominating most social platforms these days, AI can be marketed as a way to simplify a traditionally time-consuming process. "AI tools make it easier for more people to be creators," said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at Raptive. "It increases the footprint of who can be a creator much faster." Chatting with Bannister helped to offset a bit of my skepticism; he reminded me that "like any new technology, there are always good and bad uses." Along with AI slop, he noted, there's still human creativity behind the (oftentimes ridiculous) AI content we see online. "There will be lots of junk and bumps in the road and problems, but maybe this can create amazing new forms of information-sharing and entertainment," Bannister said. "There's still so much junk flowing through the system that we don't know what that outcome is going to be." There's another side to what AI is capable of: "It's going to be used for further exacerbating tensions, for confirming people's pre-existing biases," Mantzarlis said. Social media is already an echo chamber for reaffirming people's harmful, close-minded viewpoints and rapidly spreading misinformation. I'm not sure we're prepared for just how much worse that can get when everyone has the power to easily manufacture their own reality and share it with the world. The fracturing of society is only going to show wider cracks. If anything, I'd appreciate it if more platforms gave us the option to dial down how much AI we see on our feeds. Though given the choice, I'd dial it all the way down to zero.

Title: Nvidia’s earnings could answer the AI bubble question and upend global markets in moment of truth for Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/19/nvidia-earnings-artificial-intelligence-magnificent-seven-apple-stocks-investors-guide/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

India’s most used business software isn’t chosen - it’s tolerated. Over the past 18 months, I poured lakhs of rupees and time into building automation tools on top of WhatsApp - and failed. That failure opened up something bigger: a look into the tangled web that holds up India’s messaging infrastructure. This is everything good, bad, and quietly dangerous about WhatsApp - and our growing dependence on it. It’s quite a long read. In 2023, I met a cosmetic store owner in Nagpur who had accidentally invented demand forecasting. He sells beauty products - Korean serums, Indian sunscreens, foreign moisturizers. His challenge wasn’t competition or pricing. It was more existential: his shelf space could hold maybe 200 SKUs, but his customers now wanted access to 2,000. Ten years ago, this wasn’t a problem. A woman would walk into his store, and he’d guide her. “Try this Lakmé sunscreen. Let me show you how to apply it.” He hired young women specifically for this - people who could explain products, who could teach. But Instagram changed the game. Women no longer came to his store to discover products. They came with screenshots, asking for specific Korean brands they’d seen on reels. If he didn’t have it, they left. And he couldn’t stock everything. So he invented a system. He joined a vendor WhatsApp group - wholesalers who posted about new products arriving in the market. When something looked promising, he’d post the image to his WhatsApp status. Or he’d share it in a customer group he’d built over years. Then he’d wait. If even two or three people asked for the price, he knew there was demand. He’d place an order before the product even touched his shelf. He wasn’t using WhatsApp for communication and marketing alone but turned it into a just-in-time inventory system. This was India’s answer to the Shopify + Stripe stack. Discovery happened on Instagram. Demand validation happened on WhatsApp Status. Payment happened on UPI. Small businesses had discovered that consumer apps could be hacked into business tools. In this WhatsApp owns India’s communications layer. And unlike every other tech platform, there’s no competitor even close. Instagram competes with Twitter and YouTube. WhatsApp has... nothing. This creates both opportunity and danger. WhatsApp isn’t a product Indians use. It’s infrastructure Indians depend on. Infrastructure is different from products. Products are things you choose. Infrastructure is what you assume exists. You don’t think about electricity until the power goes out. You don’t think about roads until they’re blocked. India stopped thinking about WhatsApp years ago. It’s just... there. Assumed. Essential. This matters because of a simple truth: when something becomes infrastructure, its problems stop being individual frustrations and start being citizen problems. A business owner spending two hours a day manually managing WhatsApp groups isn’t just inefficient - it’s a productivity tax on the entire economy. WhatsApp work messages and personal messages in groups - it’s a design failure that affects work-life balance for millions. The question isn’t whether India needs better WhatsApp tools. The question is whether WhatsApp, as designed by Meta for Meta’s goals, can ever serve as the infrastructure India needs. To answer that, we need to understand what WhatsApp actually is - and what it isn’t. Most people think WhatsApp is a single app. It isn’t. Meta offers three distinct products with different users: WhatsApp: The everyday consumer app WhatsApp Business: A mobile app for small businesses, with profiles, catalogs, chat labels, and auto-replies to manage customer chats. WhatsApp Business API: Not an app but infrastructure - an API (via Meta Cloud or Business Solution Partners [1]) that connects WhatsApp to CRMs or back-end systems for large-scale messaging. Bottom line: one phone number can be linked to only one WhatsApp product at a time. If it’s registered on the WhatsApp Business API, it can’t also be used on the standard app - and vice versa. Though WhatsApp has rolled out a recent workaround. Here’s the critical part: these three “WhatsApps” behave very differently The consumer app and the WhatsApp Business mobile app expose full phone UIs (groups, stories, calls, broadcast lists, catalogs) that people and small shops use directly on an app. But the WhatsApp Business API historically only supported a subset of the app features and couldn’t do many of the interactive, UI-driven fetures that make WhatsApp feel like WhatsApp. For example, you cannot create or manage groups, post WhatsApp Status, or manage channels via APIs yet. Update: Meta has added Groups endpoints and a Calling API to the WhatsApp Business Platform. You can now automate some group actions and initiate voice calls via the API - within tight limits and platform rules. As of Oct 28, 2025 there’s still no official API to post Status Updates like the mobile app. In short: when small businesses say “we run everything on WhatsApp,” they usually mean the consumer or Business mobile apps - with manual groups, broadcasts, and catalogs. True automation and scale require the Business Platform/API, which is powerful but not really designed for typical SME needs. WhatsApp’s business model is simple. Meta charges per message on the WhatsApp Business API, with rates varying by country and message type (Marketing, Utility, Authentication, Service). Businesses can reply free of charge within 24 hours of a user’s message; after that, only approved templates can be sent - and those cost money. In India, rates are about ₹0.78 for marketing and ₹0.11 for utility/authentication messages. Example: 10,000 marketing messages = ₹7,800; 1,000,000 = ₹7.8 lakh monthly. Businesses can use the platform directly via Meta’s Cloud API or through Business Solutions Providers like Gupshup, WATI, Interakt, or Twilio. BSPs add their own fees on top of Meta’s, so prices include markups and platform charges. Most WhatsApp SaaS vendors sell both software and message credits - earning largely from those markups. When Meta changes rates, profits shrink or costs rise for customers, creating instability. The pricing volatility makes WhatsApp a shaky base for predictable business models. Here’s a paradox: The businesses that most need WhatsApp automation are the ones least able to use it. For instance, one of the most common patterns we’ve seen is business owners consistently updating their WhatsApp status each morning with details about the day’s fresh vegetables, sharing posts about new stock in their groups, and responding to customer inquiries within minutes. These actions have become almost daily rituals for entrepreneurs running their businesses on WhatsApp. Such simple automations today are not possible on the main WhatsApp mobile apps but only possible in their API version. Most small businesses in India use one phone number for everything - personal and work. But the WhatsApp Business API needs a separate, dedicated number that can’t run on the regular or Business app. Porting the existing number would mean losing existing chats and giving up the mobile app and certain crucial features like groups management and WhatsApp status posting. Without the WhatsApp Business API even simple automations stay out of reach for SMEs Even with an additional number, setup is a pain. You need to link it to Meta Business Manager, create and submit message templates - all buried in Meta’s dashboards. Many small businesses turn to unofficial modified versions (mods) of WhatsApp or to access automation and additional features. GBWhatsApp is the most famous unofficial app that can help you run two accounts, auto-reply, tag chats, and send follow-ups, see deleted messages - without using the official API. These tools work but violate WhatsApp’s rules, risk malware or data leaks, and can lead to account bans. Here are some top features of the WhatsApp ‘mods’ that are helpful for SMEs Auto Reply: Configure automatic replies per message or contact. Message Scheduler: Schedule messages to send at set times. Broadcast to Multiple Groups: Send one message across several groups at once. Multi Account Support: Use two or more WhatsApp accounts on one device. Bypass Forward Limit: Forward messages to unlimited chats. Always Online Mode: Keep your status showing online continuously. It’s a messy market trading serious security and compliance risks for convenience. The irony is almost poetic: WhatsApp became essential infrastructure because it was simple and open to everyone. Yet, the moment businesses try to do anything advanced with it, it turns into a maze. And there’s another catch: most WhatsApp automation tools live on the web, not as mobile apps. Why? Because if you try to launch a mobile app called “WhatsApp for Business” or “WhatsApp Automation,” Meta will hit you with a trademark notice, and Google Play will take it down. So every SaaS company ends up building a web dashboard instead. But the small business owners live on their mobile devices. If the problem were just technical limits, businesses could adapt- learn the rules, find workarounds, move on. But the real instability comes from something deeper: WhatsApp optimizes for Meta’s goals, not yours - and those goals change without warning. That creates systemic unpredictability that businesses quietly pay for. Delivery drops: In 2022–23, marketing messages reached 90–95% of users. By mid-2025, that fell below 75%. Meta added hidden user-level caps to fight spam - no announcement, no numbers. Businesses only found out after delivery cratered. [2] Sudden suspensions: Accounts get blocked - sometimes permanently - for vague policy violations. The appeal process is slow, and while it runs, operations stop cold. [3] Shifting rules: In Oct 2025, WhatsApp quietly banned all “general-purpose AI chatbots.” The term isn’t defined, leaving even compliant tools exposed. [4] Even if you master the tech, pricing, and compliance, you’re still building on shifting ground - where Meta’s priorities decide your uptime. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: these aren’t problems Meta is trying to solve. They’re features of the system working as intended. Meta is an advertising company; ads pay the bills. Every product in their portfolio - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, even Oculus - exists to collect data and sell ads. WhatsApp is the outlier. It’s a messaging tool that, in a different world, might have evolved like Telegram, Slack or Microsoft Teams: an open platform where developers build productivity tools, businesses customize workflows, and ecosystems flourish. But that’s not Meta’s DNA. If WhatsApp opened up like Slack, businesses would build their own solutions. They’d customize the experience. They’d create value that Meta couldn’t capture. From Meta’s perspective, that’s money left on the table. So instead, WhatsApp is being slowly transformed into an ads platform. You’re starting to see it: Ads in WhatsApp Status (already rolling out) Paid WhatsApp channels (in beta) Business messaging in groups Click to WhatsApp ads From a pure business perspective, this makes sense. Why would Meta invest engineering resources to solve a hundred-million-dollar problem (Indian MSME productivity) when they could deploy those same resources toward a billion-dollar opportunity (WhatsApp ads)? To put it bluntly: Meta doesn’t care about your kirana store’s inventory management problem. Not because they’re evil, but because they’re a trillion-dollar company optimizing for trillion-dollar opportunities. WhatsApp will never be the open platform India needs, because Meta’s business model requires it to stay closed. Which raises an obvious question: If WhatsApp can’t serve as the infrastructure India needs, what can? India’s WhatsApp problem isn’t unique. China faced something similar a decade ago - and solved it deliberately. WeChat handles everything WhatsApp does, plus native payments, mini-apps, ride-hailing, food delivery, and government services. The architectural choices Tencent made are precisely what WhatsApp lacks. In WeChat, businesses can send users only 4 marketing messages directly per month through service account. Beyond that, marketing messages get quarantined into a separate subscription feed/folder - visible but segregated from personal conversations. This forces discipline. Every message must justify its existence. The result: businesses target better, users feel less harassed, and the platform maintains trust. WhatsApp has no such limits. Businesses face tiered messaging caps (starting at 1,000 recipients daily for new accounts) but these scale automatically based on quality scores. The only real constraint is cost - and when marketing messages work, companies pay willingly. The incentive structure rewards volume, not restraint. When an employee leaves a Chinese company, their WeChat relationships vanish with them- customer conversations, sales context, years of institutional knowledge, gone. Tencent solved this with WeCom (WeChat Work), a parallel app for professional communication. In WeCom, workplace conversations belong to the company, not the employee. When someone leaves, their account transfers. Customer relationships survive. Search for a person on WeChat in China, you see two options: their personal WeChat, professional WeCom. Same ecosystem, separate contexts. You message friends on WeChat, coordinate work on WeCom. Both feel familiar, both interoperate, neither bleeds into the other. In 2022, WeCom has about 180 Million active users and are used by over 10 million businesses in China. [5] The boutique store owner shouldn’t manage customer orders where his daughter sends memes. The sales team shouldn’t lose client relationships when someone quits. The contractor shouldn’t coordinate labor in the same group planning his wife’s birthday. The solution exists. WeCom proves separating contexts without fragmenting networks is possible. But WhatsApp won’t implement it - not because of encryption, but because of infrastructure. WhatsApp’s value to Meta isn’t in reading your messages - they’re encrypted. It’s in the metadata around them: who you talk to, when, from where, and which businesses you engage with. Meta has added ads to WhatsApp’s Status tab, but the real value lies in metadata and business messaging, not large-scale ad placements. Linking WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram through Accounts Center lets Meta build a unified behavioral profile - without touching message content. [6] Splitting personal and professional WhatsApp use would shatter that identity layer. Meta wouldn’t lose access to messages - it never had them - but it would lose the metadata correlation powering cross-platform personalization. Keeping all communication in one place creates richer data, tighter business tracking, and a more valuable ecosystem. Which leaves the real question: if Meta won’t separate it, who will? WhatsApp isn’t going anywhere.Half a billion Indians won’t switch apps. Businesses won’t rebuild customer relationships. The network effects are too strong, the switching costs too high. Our goal should be to build optionality in the form of building ONDC-like infra for messaging. A protocol could make the platform used irrelevant. Instead of building one mega-app to rule all of e-commerce, ONDC built the rails underneath. A seller listing on one ONDC app can be discovered by buyers on completely different apps. Orders, payments, fulfillment - all work across platforms. No gatekeepers. Just open infrastructure. The same architecture can break WhatsApp’s monopoly. A messaging protocol doesn’t need 500 million users on day one. It needs 500,000 users who will pay because the protocol solves a problem WhatsApp won’t. For example we could start with construction contractors. They need labor coordination, site photos, payment tracking, and material orders - all over messaging. WhatsApp works, but barely. A purpose-built tool would save them hours daily. That’s the wedge. Once one vertical proves interoperability works, others follow - logistics, healthcare, education, government services. The network grows without forcing anyone to switch. The protocol layer should provide the essential stuff: End-to-end encryption standards Message delivery guarantees Identity verification Cross-app routing APIs Different apps build specialized experiences on top: One for Gen Z, one for the elderly, one for MSMEs and they should all be able to talk to each other. Same network. Different interfaces. Just like you can email someone on Gmail from Outlook. The protocol doesn’t care. It just routes messages. Email, the web, and Bluetooth already work on open protocols. WhatsApp solved India’s communication problem. Now India needs to solve WhatsApp’s incentive problem. That doesn’t mean banning WhatsApp or building a clone. It means creating optionality - a messaging layer where WhatsApp is one choice among many, not the only one that works. This isn’t about nationalism or rejecting foreign technology. It’s about infrastructure resilience. No nation should have its business communication layer entirely controlled by a single foreign corporation with different incentives. The question isn’t whether to replace WhatsApp. The question is: What does India need to build so that WhatsApp’s limitations stop being India’s limitations? That’s the conversation worth having.

You can download the People’s Voice report on AI opportunities for Indian SMEs, created by People+AI in collaboration with 1990 Research Labs, below. Download Report This is hands-down one of the best infrastructure analysis pieces I've read on Indian tech. The cosmetic store owner's WhatsApp-as-inventory-system story perfectly captures how consumer apps get hacked into business tools when proper B2B infrastructure doesn't exist. What really stands out is your framing of the incentive mismatch: Meta optimizes for trillion-dollar ad opportunities while Indian MSMEs need hundred-million-dollar productivity solutions. That gap explains everything - the API restrictions, the pricing volatility, the feature stagnation. The WeChat/WeCom comparison is especially powerful because it shows the solution exists and works at scale. The separation of personal and professional contexts isn't a technical challenge, it's a business model choice. Meta won't build it because unified identity metadata across contexts is more valuable than serving SME needs. Your ONDC-for-messaging proposal is the right architectural direction. Interoperability solves the 'network effects as moat' problem without requiring mass migration. Start with one vertical (construction contractors is a great wedge), prove the protocol works, let ecosystem diversity emerge. One addition I'd suggest: the protocol layer should include reputation/trust primitives from day one. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is great for privacy but terrible for platform-level spam control. A federated messaging protocol needs portable reputation that follows business identities across apps - otherwise every new entrant rebuilds spam filters from scratch and user experience suffers. The question isn't whether this gets built, but who builds it and whether it stays open. Government-backed infrastructure has different risks than VC-backed platforms. Both can succumb to capture. The governance model matters as much as the tehcnical architecture. Would love to see a follow-up on that. Recently we started building some small solutions on Whatsapp through BSP. Also use it as a primary comm channel. It’s abundantly clear the limitations of WhatsApp while even building simple stuff. And the cost of messaging has increased to 0.80 in India. With delivery rates reducing businesses will need to look for another solution like RCS. This almost mimics the path brand Facebook pages took. Organic reach used to be 100% and now it’s barely there No posts Ready for more?
