US tech titans are spending huge sums to win the AI race — and the ones that lose could see their stock prices take a hit, "Bond King" Bill Gross has warned. The billionaire investor gave his thoughts to Business Insider after Oracle's market value surged by as much as 43%, or nearly $300 billion, on Wednesday, thanks to an AI-driven revenue projection. "My biggest concern is what economists refer to as 'malinvestment,' Gross said in an email. Gross — who cofounded the fixed-income titan PIMCO and grew its flagship Total Return Fund to $270 billion over nearly three decades — said the tech giants are racing to dominate various AI sectors and "seem willing to risk over-investment in hopes of future monopolies." "Some will fail and current trends — and stock prices based on them — may experience significantly reduced growth," Gross said. He singled out AI data centers and the "hundreds of billions" being spent on them by companies like Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Electricity providers are also "gearing up to supply them," he added. AI companies are investing vast sums in microchips, servers, and other infrastructure they need to build and train increasingly advanced models and harness AI in other ways. Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet are poised to invest more than $300 billion into AI this year. The immense buzz around AI has lit a fire under tech stocks. Shares of the nine most valuable tech companies — Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Broadcom, Tesla, and Oracle — have all more than doubled since the start of 2023, with Nvidia surging about 12-fold and Meta leaping around six-fold. The group's combined market value now exceeds $22 trillion. Jump to

Business FILE PHOTO: Larry Ellison reacts, at the White House, in Washington, U.S. February 3, 2025. REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz/File photo SAN FRANCISCO :Fortune magazine wondered on its cover whether Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison might become the world's richest person, while BusinessWeek declared Ellison is "cool again," noting that "Silicon Valley's bad boy is having his revenge." Both were published 25 years ago, but they could've run this week. The octogenarian Ellison is back in headlines after Oracle announced a clutch of cloud computing deals that rocked the tech world and sent its stock up 35.9 per cent, putting Ellison's fortune close to $400 billion, second globally only to Elon Musk. Then on Thursday, news broke that Paramount, the media conglomerate Ellison's family now controls, is preparing a bid to buy out the storied Warner Bros Discovery, threatening overnight to dominate Hollywood and culture. The swashbuckling billionaire may have been known more for his yacht collection, his ownership of a Hawaiian island or his longstanding support of Donald Trump.

Title: AI hype has just shaken up the world’s rich list. What if the boom is really a bubble?

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.wdun44ema Share article Print article Just for a moment this week, Larry Ellison, co-founder of US cloud computing company Oracle, became the world’s richest person. The octogenarian tech titan briefly overtook Elon Musk after Oracle’s share price rocketed 43% in a day, adding about US$100 billion (A$150 billion) to his wealth. The reason? Oracle inked a deal to provide artificial intelligence (AI) giant OpenAI with US$300 billion (A$450 billion) in computing power over five years. While Ellison’s moment in the spotlight was fleeting, it also illuminated something far more significant: AI has created extraordinary levels of concentration in global financial markets. This raises an uncomfortable question not only for seasoned investors – but also for everyday Australians who hold shares in AI companies via their superannuation. Just how exposed are even our supposedly “safe”, “diversified” investments to the AI boom? As billionaires go, Ellison isn’t as much of a household name as Tesla and SpaceX’s Musk or Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. But he’s been building wealth from enterprise technology for nearly five decades. Ellison co-founded Oracle in 1977, transforming it into one of the world’s largest database software companies. For decades, Oracle provided the unglamorous but essential plumbing that kept many corporate systems running. The AI revolution changed everything. Oracle’s cloud computing infrastructure, which helps companies store and process vast amounts of data, became critical infrastructure for the AI boom. Every time a company wants to train large language models or run machine learning algorithms, they need huge amounts of computing power and data storage. That’s precisely where Oracle excels. When Oracle reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings this week, driven largely by soaring AI demand, its share price spiked. That response wasn’t just about Oracle’s business fundamentals. It was about the entire AI ecosystem that has been reshaping global markets since ChatGPT’s public debut in late 2022. Oracle’s story is part of a much larger phenomenon reshaping global markets. The so-called “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – now control an unprecedented share of major stock indices. Year-to-date in 2025, these seven companies have come to represent approximately 39% of the US S&P500’s total value. For the tech-heavy NASDAQ100, the figure is a whopping 74%. This means if you invest in an exchange-traded fund that tracks the S&P500 index, often considered the gold standard of diversified investing, you’re making an increasingly concentrated bet on AI, whether you realise it or not. This level of concentration has not been seen since the late 1990s. Back then, investors were swept up in “dot-com mania”, driving technology stock prices to unsustainable levels. When reality finally hit in March 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq crashed 77% over two years, wiping out trillions in wealth. Today’s AI concentration raises some similar red flags. Nvidia, which controls an estimated 90% of the AI chip market, currently trades at more than 30 times expected earnings. This is expensive for any stock, let alone one carrying the hopes of an entire technological revolution. Yet, unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are profitable companies with real revenue streams. Microsoft, Apple and Google aren’t cash-burning startups. They are established giants, using AI to enhance existing businesses while generating substantial profits. This makes the current situation more complicated than a simple “bubble” comparison. The academic literature on market bubbles suggests genuine technological innovation often coincides with speculative excess. The question isn’t whether AI is transformative; it clearly is. Rather, the question is whether current valuations reflect realistic expectations about future profitability. For Australians, the AI concentration problem hits remarkably close to home through our superannuation system. Many balanced super fund options include substantial allocations to international shares, typically 20–30% of their portfolios. When your super fund buys international shares, it’s often getting heavy exposure to those same AI giants dominating US markets. The concentration risk extends beyond direct investments in tech companies. Australian mining companies, such as BHP and Fortescue, have become indirect AI players because their copper, lithium and rare earth minerals are essential for AI infrastructure. Even diversifying away from technology doesn’t fully escape AI-related risks. Research on portfolio concentration shows when major indices become dominated by a few large stocks, the benefits of diversification diminish significantly. If AI stocks experience a significant correction or crash, it could disproportionately impact Australians’ retirement nest eggs. This situation represents what’s called “systemic concentration risk”. This is a specific form of systemic risk where supposedly diversified investments become correlated through common underlying factors or exposures. It’s reminiscent of the 2008 financial crisis, when seemingly separate housing markets across different regions all collapsed simultaneously. That was because they were all exposed to subprime mortgages with high risk of default. This does not mean anyone should panic. But regulators, super fund trustees and individual investors should all be aware of these risks. Diversification only works if returns come from a broad range of companies and industries.

Shares in the New York-based firm are expected to begin trading Friday, concluding the IPO process that first began when it filed its intentions with the SEC in June. Here’s everything you need to know about the Gemini IPO. More than 16 million shares of GEMI will be offered by the exchange in the price range of $24-26, potentially netting the firm around $433 million in IPO proceeds based on its recent upsized filing. Even at that number, which increased from a previously expected share price range of $17-19, Reuters reported that the firm’s offering was oversubscribed by as much as 20 times. Based on the upper range of the expected share price, Gemini could surpass an initial valuation of $3 billion. Though the firm is offering up 16.67 million shares, it requested that underwriters reserve 10% of the supply—or around 1.67 million shares—for sale through a “directed share program,” which will offer them exclusively to select parties. Gemini is perhaps best known for its co-founders Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, early Bitcoin and cryptocurrency believers that vocally and financially supported President Donald Trump in his bid to reclaim the presidency in 2024. They also played a key role in the creation of Facebook, as chronicled in the film “The Social Network.” The firm primarily generates its revenue from trading fees earned via the use of its centralized exchange. According to its IPO filing, nearly 70% of the firm’s revenue was earned in this manner during 2024. Last year, the firm generated $142.2 million in revenue, yet sustained a net income loss of $158.5 million. Through the first six months of this year, the firm’s percentage of trading fee revenue dipped to 65.5%, pulling in total revenue of $68.6 million. That puts it on track to finish just below last year’s revenue number. In the same timeframe, the firm generated a net income loss of $282.5 million. Despite the sagging income numbers, the firm remains optimistic about its future. Gemini wrote in its filing that based on its “focus on innovation and a long history of firsts in the crypto industry, we believe our products and services can fulfill the needs of our ever-expanding user base, including as traditional financial market participants enter the space.” Gemini’s intentions to go public came shortly after the massively successful IPO of stablecoin issuer, Circle. Like Gemini, Circle upsized its IPO and still more than tripled the offering price on the first day of trading, outperforming public launches from tech giants like Meta and Airbnb in the process. Since Circle’s IPO, crypto exchanges like Kraken and Gemini filed their intentions to go public. Crypto exchange Bullish also recently completed its IPO, similarly screaming out of the gate and tripling after hitting the market. American Bitcoin, the BTC mining firm co-founded by Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, also surged after its recent launch. On Thursday, crypto lender Figure raised more than $787 million in its IPO, ultimately notching a valuation of $5.29 billion. Shares jumped more than 24% from the IPO price once they hit the market for trading. As barriers to entry for buying and selling cryptocurrency have decreased, centralized exchanges like Gemini and rivals Coinbase and Binance have become increasingly competitive in trying to acquire and maintain users. Based on its filing, Gemini is hoping to increase both its monthly transacting users and the average daily trading volume of those users. It aims to do so via expanding its product suite, expanding internationally, and growing its derivative offerings—and a big chunk of IPO cash could help it accomplish those goals.

Meta Ray-Bans have often been very difficult to find in stock at both retailers and online stores for the past two years -- and they rarely go on sale. But one of the best ways to not only get a 20% discount but also find some of the styles that have been discontinued or are rarely ever in stock is to use the little-known Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store. I recently ordered a pair of Meta Ray-Bans in the Skylar style with the Shiny Caramel finish with Polar Brown lenses. If you've followed Meta Ray-Bans, then you've probably seen these before because they are in a lot of the Meta promotional materials. The frames themselves are semi-transparent, so you can see a lot of the technology inside. And the lenses have that amber tint that's popular in lots of sunglasses because it gives the world a bit of warm orange glow. I was able to buy these for $263, even though they normally retail for $329. Other configurations, like the black with blue transition lenses, were as much as $76 off. As of the writing of this article, Meta's refurbished store was selling the Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles. The Wayfarer is the most common style, while the Headliner and Skyler can be more difficult to find. Also: 5 Meta Ray-Ban upgrades I want to see on September 17 When my transparent brown Meta Ray-Bans arrived, they were in the original box and it was unopened, with the perforated pull tag still in perfect condition -- no different than the box of the original pair of black Meta Ray-Bans I bought when the product first launched two years ago. When I opened the box, everything was in perfect order, just like a new pair. All the accessories, booklets, polishing cloth, and even the paper protectors over the arms of the glasses were just as they are in the packaging of a brand-new pair of Meta Ray-Bans that you'd buy at retail or online. Also: I tried Meta's new Oakley smart glasses in my production studio - my verdict as a content creator I pulled the little protective tab inside the case to activate charging and plugged the case into a USB. After about 30 minutes, I opened the Meta AI app, tapped the glasses button on the far right, hit the plus sign in the upper right corner, and tapped on the Ray-Ban | Meta button. The software immediately recognized that a pair of glasses was in a case nearby. I accepted the prompt and tapped through the menus. I pulled the glasses out of the case and examined them, and they were in perfect condition. I put them on and immediately started using them like the other pairs of Meta Ray-Bans I've been testing and using for the past couple of years. So if these are just like new and sold at a discount, then what does it mean when you buy a refurbished tech product? These are typically products that have been lightly used and a customer returned or traded in for another product, or that originally had small defects. They go back to the manufacturer for inspection, cleaning, repair (if needed), and another round of quality assurance. Also: I tried smart glasses with a built-in display, and they beat my Meta Ray-Bans in key ways They are then repacked, often in the same original packaging as new products. However, both the US and the European Union have regulations that require refurbished products to be marked and sold as refurbished, and can't be passed off as new products. That's why they are typically discounted, even though in many cases they are as good as new. In the case of refurbished Meta Ray-Bans, when you buy through the Meta Refurbished AI Glasses online store, then Meta offers a 30-day return policy and a 1-year warranty. Based on my experience, I have no problem recommending that you buy a refurbished pair of these smart glasses, if one of the styles you like is available. Keep in mind that Meta is likely to unveil its next-generation Meta Ray-Bans Smart Glasses on September 17 at its Meta Connect event. These could have new features like longer battery life and better cameras -- two of the items on my wish list. It's unclear if they will be more expensive, but it appears possible if they are integrating better technology, and there's also the uncertain US tariff situation that could impact the cost of parts. The recently released Oakley Meta Smart Glasses have some nice tech upgrades and retail for $400-$500. That could be an indication of where the prices of the new Meta Ray-Bans are going to land. If that's the case, the deal on these refurbished Meta Ray-Bans could look even better.

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. 2025 might just be the year of Oracle. The 48-year-old tech company’s stock value has doubled year-to-date, and just in the last week, soared by over 30% off the heels of a bullish earnings report. Oracle’s market cap is now valued over $920 billion—higher than that of Walmart and JPMorgan Chase. This substantial stock performance has boosted the wealth of Oracle’s investors, namely Larry Ellison. As the company’s founder, chairman, and chief technology officer, his wealth has grown to over $350 billion, putting him neck-and-neck with Elon Musk as the world’s richest person. But it’s not just Ellison who’s been owed all the credit—or the award. Oracle’s CEO Safra Catz has been at the helm of the company for over a decade, and her wealth jumped by over $400 million in just six hours on Wednesday to $3.4 billion, according to Forbes. “Clearly, we had an amazing start to the year because Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said during Tuesday’s earnings call. “We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia, AMD and many others.” Catz’s leadership successes at Oracle have cemented her as one of the richest self-made women in the world, having climbed the ladder first on Wall Street as an investment banker before heading to Silicon Valley to join Oracle (the tech firm later moved to Austin in 2020). And part of what has helped drive the tech company to succeed is her mantra to always be the best. “We don’t want to follow others. We always try to do something differently,” she told CNBC earlier this year. “Being No. 1 is very, very important. It also means you’re the best and solving customers’ needs. On the surface level, Oracle’s recent stock success is somewhat head-scratching. The company has been around for over four decades, and other big-name tech companies, such as IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, have made the cloud services market more crowded than ever. Moreover, during Tuesday’s earnings report, Oracle announced it actually had slightly missed earnings and revenue projections. However, investors have been more impressed with what Oracle has coming down the pipeline, namely its plan to 14x its cloud infrastructure revenue. By fiscal year 2030, its cloud infrastructure revenue will be $144 billion—up from fiscal year 2025’s $10.3 billion. Just this week, OpenAI signed a $300 billion cloud contract with Oracle for the construction of data centers over the next five years, according to The New York Times. As the roughly 41% stakeholder in Oracle, Ellison has reaped the greatest benefits from his tech company’s 450% share price growth over the last five years. The 81-year-old also has gained substantial wealth from previous involvement in Tesla, as well as now owning close to 50% in Paramount Skydance. Catz too owes her billionaire status to Oracle. Although her base salary is $950,000, the majority of her wealth is connected to the market. She maintains about 1.1 million in shares but regularly receives and exercises stock options; earlier this year, she sold stock options worth some $1.8 billion, according to Bloomberg. Fortune reached out to Oracle for comment. Catz is a double graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, having gone to law school shortly after graduating with a business-focused bachelor’s degree. And even though she ultimately decided to forgo a career in law, she has no regrets. “My best decision was to choose to go to Wall Street over law. I learned a lot and focused on the expanding software industry at a time when the independent software industry was just beginning,” she told Time in 2010. “That ultimately brought me to Oracle.” And as a leader, one of her core principles is always keeping an open mind. “Listen, think and don’t be afraid to change your position based on new facts,” she told Fortune in 2015 after being asked the biggest leadership lesson she’d learned over the past year. The then-newly minted co-CEO of Oracle added that employees deserve to be heard out in every meeting. “If something doesn’t make sense, give them the respect of asking tough questions,” she said. “Think about what you’ve been told because if it doesn’t make sense to you, then it may not make sense at all. But, then again, they just might be right.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Oracle CEO Larry Ellison’s ability to secure Nvidia GPUs has made it the cloud contender it never was and allowed Ellison to briefly surpass Elon Musk as the world’s richest man

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. It’s Jeremy here, filling in for Andrew, who is now on paternity leave for a bit. So you’ll see a rotating cast of Fortune tech journalists writing this newsletter for a few weeks. Fortune Brainstorm Tech wrapped yesterday. Here were a few highlights from the final day of the conference: Meanwhile, the tech world is talking about Oracle’s massive market gains, which have boosted Oracle founder, chairman, and chief technology officer Larry Ellison’s net worth, allowing him to surpass Elon Musk to claim the title of world’s richest man. Helping to drive Oracle’s stock was the announcement of a massive $300 billion deal with OpenAI to supply the AI company with data center capacity. (Now we know why OpenAI is telling investors it’s going to burn through $115 billion in cash by 2029.) Of course, the only reason Oracle is in this position is down to Ellison’s courting of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, which has allowed his company, previously a distinct back-of-the-pack cloud company, to secure a massive stockpile of top-of-the-line Nvidia GPUs. More on Ellison’s soaring fortunes below. Buy-now, pay-later fintech Klarna’s IPO went off, with the company’s shares gaining 15% on opening day. (Whether that “opening day pop” is a good thing is a debate for another day. It seems like the finance profs have mostly lost the argument, with bankers convincing companies that the money lost from underpricing the shares is worth its weight in marketing and investor buzz from the opening day jump.) Beatrice Nolan has more too on Sam Altman’s sit down with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson. While Altman said a number of interesting things—most of which he has said before—the real news was the fact that Atlman felt the need to do Carlson’s podcast in the first place. Clearly OpenAI has seen reports that the MAGA crowd is unhappy with President Donald Trump’s cozy relationship with Silicon Valley’s biggest players and is hoping to win them over. The MAGA wing of the Republican Party views AI companies with at best skepticism and at worst, downright disdain, seeing them as woke bastions of left wing coastal elitism, exemplars of Silicon Valley’s inordinate, insidious, and arbitrary power, and, in their quest to build AGI and “superintelligence,” guilty of a kind of idolatry (essentially trying to build God in a machine). You can watch Carlson press Altman on these points throughout the podcast, while Altman tries, often awkwardly, to parry the premise of Carlson’s questions, or assure Carlson that there’s really not as much ideological distance between them as Carlson seems to assume. It’s all slightly cringey (especially Carlson’s over-the-top facial expressions). But, despite the cringe factor, it is probably worth watching, if only to get a deeper sense of the reasons MAGA distrusts Silicon Valley in general and AI in particular. Ok, now here’s more tech news. —Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Oracle’s revenue projections sent the stock, and Ellison’s net worth, soaring on Wednesday. It was bad news for old friend Elon Musk, though, whose nearly year-long reign as the world’s richest man came to a brief end. (Oracle stock pulled back a bit before the close, allowing Musk to regain the title.) Oracle’s strong quarterly results added a whopping $101 billion to Ellison’s wealth at one point, boosting his fortune to $393 billion and leapfrogging above Musk’s $385 billion, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index. The staggering increase was the largest one-day increase ever recorded by the index. Oracle stock surged 36% on Wednesday—the company’s biggest one-day increase ever—after executives reported blowout bookings and gave a bullish cloud outlook. The rally adds to the 45% gain the company already notched up this year. The Wall Street Journal reported that the majority of the new revenue will come from OpenAI, which signed a staggering $300B cloud agreement with Oracle. The AI firm will tap Oracle’s computing infrastructure under the billion dollar deal, which is one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed. The commitment far exceeds OpenAI’s current revenue. Oracle’s revenue projections shocked analysts, who told CNBC they were “blown away” and “all kind of in shock.” Some, however, are urging caution, warning the unprecedented success has made the stock overvalued. —Beatrice Nolan The pair also discussed OpenAI cofounder Elon Musk, with Altman saying he now “feels differently” about the man he once saw as an “incredible hero.” Perhaps it's because of the lawsuits, or the X spats. In one tense moment, when the pair discussed OpenAI whistleblower Suchir Balaji’s death, Altman asked if Carlson was accusing him of murder after the podcast host declared the death, which authorities have ruled as a suicide, “definitely murder.” "I haven't done too many interviews where I have been accused of murder,” Altman said. —Beatrice Nolan Microsoft is cracking down on its hybrid work policy. The tech giant is mandating a minimum of three in-office days a week for employees beginning February 2026, according to a Business Insider report. The policy will first apply to Seattle-area staff, later expanding nationwide and globally. Workers have until Sept. 19 to request exceptions. Microsoft rolled out a flexible work policy after offices reopened from pandemic closures where employees were permitted to work from home up to half the time without official approval. This move follows similar steps from Big Tech rivals including Meta and Google, which already enforce similar RTO rules. The stricter approach comes as the company increases pressure on employees, reshaping performance expectations in an effort to prepare for the next phase of AI-driven growth. Staff in Microsoft’s AI division, led by DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman, will face an even stricter requirement: four days a week on site starting January 2026, with exceptions only granted at the highest levels. —Beatrice Nolan Klarna climbed 15% in its Wednesday trading debut. The Swedish-born fintech shares closed at $45.82, 15% above the $40 offer price. CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski framed the listing as proof Klarna is moving beyond buy-now, pay-later into broader banking products, even if the company’s value has dropped well below its 2021 peak. The closing price values the company at over $17 billion based on its outstanding shares, with stock options and warrants adding slightly to that figure. The company’s debut also made dozens of staffers millionaires, and its cofounders billionaires. The listing arrives amid a resurgence in the IPO market, which has been under pressure, with companies including Figma debuting with strong performances. Klarna’s debut didn’t quite make the same splash as Figma’s in July, which saw the stock more than triple from its offer price. —Beatrice Nolan —Meta and TikTok score a win against EU tech fees. But won’t receive any money back while officials reformulate the levy. —Apple’s new AI guidelines are Trump-friendly. The company marked DEI as a “controversial” topic. —Reddit removes subscriber counts from subreddits. The platform will switch to displaying weekly active visitors. —Amazon-owned Zoox launches public service in Las Vegas. It’s limited to pick-ups and drop-offs at a select number of pre-approved locations. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: How The 10 Richest American Hedge Fund Managers Got $20 Billion Richer In A Year

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Most hedge funds have lagged behind the AI-fueled stock market surge of the past three years, opting for lower-risk investments. But that hasn’t stopped investor money from clamoring to get access to the top firms—or investment gains and carried interest from adding billions to their billionaire owners’ pockets. The 10 richest hedge fund managers on this year’s Forbes 400 ranking of the country’s richest people are worth a combined $174 billion, up $20 billion from a year ago. Citadel’s Ken Griffin was the biggest gainer by far, with his fortune swelling by more than $7 billion to an estimated $50.4 billion, widening Griffin’s lead over the rest of the pack. The next three richest hedge fund managers in the U.S.—David Tepper of Appaloosa Management, Steve Cohen of Point72 and Israel Englander of Millennium Management—only added about $3 billion to their fortunes on average over the same span. Each of these four investors generated double-digit net returns in 2024, outperforming the 6.2% return of the HFRI 500 Fund Weighted Composite Index, which tracks the largest hedge funds that are open to new investments. That hedge fund index’s three-year average annual return through the first half of 2025 is a meager 4.6%, trounced by the S&P 500’s annualized return of 16% over that same period. Against that lackluster competition, the best of the best can charge higher fees without driving their investors away. Citadel, Millennium, Point72 and others all have implemented or expanded so-called passthrough fee arrangements in recent years that have shifted more operating costs to investors, beyond the standard 2% management fee that has long been a hedge fund staple. The top firms have staffs of several thousand employees who are expensive but have proven worthwhile. The annualized return for Citadel’s flagship Wellington fund from 1990 through 2024 is 19.5%, after fees. Millennium’s net annualized return since inception in 1989, meanwhile, is 14%, with only one down year, in 2008. Most of these top firms are largely closed to new investors, and habitually return profits to existing limited partners, in order to stay lean enough to sustain their performance. But they’ve spawned plenty of imitators, with Hedge Fund Research reporting that net inflows into hedge funds in the second quarter this year amounted to $25 billion, representing the highest quarterly net asset inflow in 11 years. Still, the gap between the upstarts and the most technologically advanced multistrategy firms is widening. Citadel, D.E. Shaw and Millennium generated $29.5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, amounting to more than 10% of the net $289 billion in gains all hedge fund managers produced. The founders of these firms have long been mainstays on The Forbes 400. Citadel has become the envy of the hedge fund world, managing $68 billion in assets, but an even larger piece of Griffin’s net worth comes from his majority ownership stake in Citadel Securities, a separate market-making firm that booked $9.7 billion in net trading revenue last year. He used some of the profits to add to his collection of homes and toys, spending $45 million on fellow Forbes 400 member Julia Koch’s Park Avenue co-op this February and $18 million on rare copies of the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th Amendment signed by Abraham Lincoln. He intends to loan those documents for public display ahead of the United States’ 250th birthday festivities next year. Tepper’s personal capital makes up the majority of Appaloosa’s $17 billion in assets under management. The largest position in the fund’s stock portfolio as of the end of June was an $800 million stake in Chinese tech giant Alibaba, and Tepper made a significant investment in the second quarter into UnitedHealth Group, taking advantage of a steep decline in the company’s stock price. His portfolio also includes “Magnificent Seven” stocks Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Microsoft and Alphabet. Point72 has rapidly grown in size since it opened to outside capital in 2018 and now manages $40 billion in its multi-strategy funds. The firm generated $5 billion in net gains in 2024, according to LCH Investments, with its main fund returning a reported 19%. Cohen has used some of his earnings to try to make his beloved New York Mets a World Series contender, buying the MLB team for $2.4 billion in 2020 and committing a 15-year, $765 million contract to poach superstar slugger Juan Soto from the crosstown Yankees last winter. Millennium manages $78 billion and is reportedly looking to sell a minority stake in its business at a valuation of $14 billion. Selling general partnership stakes to firms like Blue Owl or Petershill Partners has become common for elite private equity firms over the past decade, and several private equity giants are also publicly traded. Investors have generally shied away from owning pieces of hedge funds on the other hand, due to the more volatile nature of the business, but with some funds producing steady returns and locking up assets for longer periods of time, Millennium could be starting a trend. Dalio sold off his ownership stake in Bridgewater and resigned from its board this year, half a century after he founded the firm in 1975, though he reportedly remains invested in its funds. Bridgewater’s assets under management have declined to $92 billion, from a high of $168 billion in 2019, during a period marked by middling performance and a prolonged leadership transition. Its flagship Pure Alpha fund rebounded with an 11.3% gain in 2024, its best year since 2018, and gained another 17% in the first half of this year. Ackman’s ambitious plans to launch a closed-end fund for U.S. investors with as much as $25 billion in new assets ended in failure when he scrapped its IPO in July 2024, but his existing $20 billion portfolio has continued to perform well. Its net return was 10.2% in 2024, fueled by stocks like Alphabet, Chipotle and Brookfield. Ackman started buying Uber stock earlier this year; the company’s shares were his largest position as of the end of June, worth $2.8 billion. He is also hoping to transform real estate developer Howard Hughes Holdings into a diversified holding company emulating Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Kovner left Caxton in 2011, handing the reins to his successor Andrew Law, after founding and running the firm for 28 years. Kovner now manages his portfolio through his family office CAM Capital and has invested in several life sciences and biotech startups in recent years, including Kriya Therapeutics, which develops gene therapies to treat chronic diseases, and Palvella Therapeutics, which is focused on treating genetic skin diseases. Shaw stepped back from day-to-day management of D.E. Shaw in 2001, leaving it in the hands of a seven-person executive committee that today manages $70 billion. But Shaw remains the firm’s principal owner, according to its SEC filings. D.E. Shaw’s flagship Composite and Oculus funds gained 18% and 36% in 2024, respectively, helping the firm produce $11.1 billion in gains, more than any other hedge fund according to LCH Investments. Tudor Investment Corp., which manages $17 billion in assets, gained a modest 6.5% last year, and its macro-focused founder is cautioning investors about what he views as an overheated stock market and the underlying dangers of artificial intelligence. In an op-ed he wrote for Time in June, Jones cited the rising unemployment rate for recent college graduates and said, “As someone who has spent nearly half a century as a professional risk manager, every alarm bell in my being is ringing.” Two Sigma’s two founders have a strained relationship that boiled into the open when a 2023 SEC filing disclosed that they were “unable to reach agreement on a number of topics.” But the quant hedge fund is still a powerhouse with $60 billion in assets under management. Overdeck and Siegel stepped back from their co-CEO roles last year to become co-chairmen of the firm, but Overdeck returned to its management committee earlier this year.

Title: Google TPUs Vs Nvidia GPUs

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google has begun placing its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in data centres run by smaller cloud providers that have long relied on Nvidia's GPUs. This is more than a product rollout—it's a calculated move in the AI infrastructure chess game. The effects extend across the AI ecosystem, creating both opportunity and uncertainty for investors. While individual AI names like Google and Nvidia could see heightened volatility as the landscape shifts, those seeking exposure with less single-stock risk might prefer diversified approaches. The High Quality Portfolio, for example, has comfortably outperformed its blended benchmark—a mix of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has delivered returns exceeding 91% since inception, letting investors participate in these structural shifts across multiple quality companies instead of betting on a single winner. Separately, see – How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? TPUs are Google's purpose-built AI chips designed specifically for machine-learning tasks. While Nvidia's GPUs are versatile general-purpose processors, TPUs act like specialized scalpels optimized for AI workloads. The latest Ironwood chip delivers 42.5 exaflops of compute per pod with more than 9,200 chips per unit—“more than 10x improvement” over Google's previous generation. Also, take a look at – How Does Google Stock Rise 2x? This puts Nvidia in an uncomfortable spot: Still, Nvidia enjoys a massive ecosystem and deep relationships. The key question: Can Google win meaningful share before Nvidia responds? This is not just about chips—it’s about control of the AI infrastructure stack. Google is effectively telling the market, “You don’t need Nvidia’s ecosystem anymore.” Yet in reducing dependence on Nvidia, customers may increase dependence on Google’s technology. For buyers, the trade-off is clear: would you rather be locked into Nvidia or Google? Separately, look at – Are Nvidia Investors Ignoring This Big Risk? Google’s custom TPU push is a bid to challenge Nvidia’s dominance. But this isn’t a simple one-on-one duel. With companies like Broadcom, AMD, and Marvell advancing their own chips, AI hardware is now a multi-player race. That’s good for the industry—more competition, more choice, and potentially lower costs. For investors, it signals a heating AI infrastructure market with no guaranteed single winner. Nvidia isn’t finished, but the competition is tougher than ever. While the AI arms race intensifies, you could explore the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000) to deliver strong returns. Why? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to benefit from upbeat markets while limiting losses when conditions turned, as shown in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Most marketers think we’ll rely on AI to produce most creative content by 2030

Advertisement September 11, 2025 | 9 min read Listen to article 4 min It’s just one finding from a new WPP report on senior marketers’ visions for advertising’s near future. We sit down with the author. What will advertising, media and our consumer lives look like in 2030? A new report asks experts. / Drmakete Lab Via Unsplash Decide for yourself how alarmed you are by a future where most ‘creative content’ (including art, music, TV shows and movies) is created by AI. But according to the 2025 edition of WPP Media’s Advertising in 2030 report, most marketers think that reality will already be with us in five years’ time. A follow-up to similar reports in 2020 and 2021, the research digs into the credence that top marketers and analysts give to certain possible near-future scenarios. The portion of respondents predicting this AI-dominated media future (now at 71%) was the greatest ‘positive’ shift in sentiment since the last edition of the report, reflecting the dizzying pace of AI-related change marketers are seeing right now. One expert interviewed for the research, attention primo Karen Nelson Field, said: “The rate of transformation in only two years since AI became accessible is astounding. Nothing will be the same across the entire advertising ecosystem in 2030.” Plenty of the study’s respondents argue that 2030 is too soon a date to predict such a major shift, or that AI is more likely to dominate advertising content than narrative entertainment, or that AI will play only a partial role. But the portion treating the scenario seriously is striking. Other formerly science-fictional scenarios viewed as likely by the study’s cohort include a 2030 where most interactions between brands and consumers are ‘bot-to-bot,’ with individuals’ personal assistants liaising directly with customer service bots. Citing efficiency, convenience and the rapidly developing sophistication of ‘agentic AI,’ 66% of respondents viewed the scenario as likely – although most (61%) don’t think we’ll yet have passed the tipping point at which most social media ‘users’ are fictitious personae. Nor do they say, on balance, that they’re expecting the efficiencies associated with automation will result in reduced working hours or wages, with 66% rejecting that scenario – despite conceding “downward pressure on wages in some sectors.” But how likely is it, really, that an industry so totally overhauled by scaled AI’s promises of efficiencies and cost-savings won’t see those efficiencies reflected in billable hours and headcounts? The report’s lead author, WPP Media’s global president of business intelligence Kate Scott-Dawkins, tells The Drum that there’s evidence in that sentiment of “a desire to be optimistic about these things in the face of so much change,” but that there may also be some reason for that optimism. “Our industry is already one of the most integrated with AI and, if you look at job numbers now in the ad industry versus 10 years ago when we first started seeing Google and Meta applying machine learning and natural language processing and all these optimization programs, we’re not dramatically worse off… So there’s some rationale for people thinking it’ll just look different. We won’t be doing the same things, but our industry has continued to grow and we’ll just be doing new things with the help of AI. We may lose some jobs and types of jobs, but I can understand why they are optimistic about the industry as a whole.” (That optimism should perhaps be tempered with the trajectory of employment figures across the industry since the AI revolution began in earnest: in toto, adland’s big five holding companies reduced their workforce by over 2% last year; WPP itself has suffered a 5% drop in headcount over the last year.) Advertisement Hovering above the AI of it all, Scott-Dawkins says there’s greater reason to be cheerful to be gleaned from the difference between this year’s report and its Covid-era predecessors. The original report set out to answer, first, a provocative question: will advertising even continue to exist in 10 years’ time? Those Covid years, she says, were a time of soul-searching and a time where the growing adoption of adblockers, all-subs-no-ads media channels like Netflix, behove the industry to ask itself existential questions. Taking stock of where the industry as a whole finds itself in 2025 shows that question has almost entirely receded from view: Netflix is now, per a headline in these pages, ‘All-in on ads’; in 2024, the global ad business saw revenues of over $1tn for the first time in history. If anything, Scott-Dawkins says, in 2025 we see an industry hungrier than ever to expand its coverage. “I’ve seen a noticeable shift in the number and types of companies that are selling advertising now, with this realization that it can be a useful revenue stream, especially in low-margin businesses like retail. And now we’re getting into all the different places where you can have screens and consumer interaction” – with growth expected not just in retail media, but transit, transport, wearables… “You can picture this world where we’re able to turn any sort of surface and glass into content. That’s an interesting counterpoint to where we were five years ago.” Other stark shifts from where we were five years ago: the metaverse, cause celebre of the industry until the AI hype cycle engulfed all the space around it, has fallen away almost entirely, taking with it predictions about growth in uses of virtual and augmented reality tech (though, Scott-Dawkins says, the experts weren’t that convinced back in 2020 either – “they’re as pessimistic now as they were then”). Scott-Dawkins goes on: “What they got wrong was the sustainability piece.” In what the report calls a “striking reversal,” predictions that the environmental impact of goods and services would be more important to us than price by 2030 swung radically. In 2020, 70% thought that was likely. Now, 74% say it’s unlikely. Acknowledging a “cultural realignment” and “greenwashing fears” on the corporate side, the report declares that “consumers and marketers both seem to be moving on.” Advertisement In the data and privacy worlds, the report finds a balance of experts predicting by 2030 the widespread use of biometric data to access and personalize services; the widespread personalization of goods and services; and the widespread accessibility of personal data by corporations and governments. But they reject as unlikely the development of single, global approaches. In tech and media, most experts rejected as unlikely a scenario where 3D printing would replace mass production. They also rejected a scenario in which “seamless micropayments” replace subscription and ad models for online publishers, and one in which most products and services would be bought as part of a subscription. They mostly agreed that the same internet service providers, platforms and social media companies would remain intact until 2030, despite ongoing antitrust actions. For publishers, they predict more change, with 63% seeing it as likely that most news consumption would come from individual creators, ‘citizen journalists’ and bots. As the next decade approaches, what’s most striking, says Scott-Dawkins, is that “people got more pessimistic across the board” – less likely, that is, to predict changes to the status quo. Will the study run again before 2030? Maybe – but maybe the AI question will by then have become even more all-pervasive. “Maybe, I don’t know, we’ll be asking AI about itself.” Catch up on the most important stories of the day, curated by our editorial team.

Title: Oracle CEO Safra Catz's net worth rises $412 million in a day as stock hits record highs

Time Published: 2025-09-11T03:40:09Z

Oracle Corp.’s stock rally this week has not only lifted the software giant’s market value but also added significantly to the personal wealth of its chief executive officer, Safra Catz. According to CNBC, Catz’s net worth surged by about $412 million during the first six hours of trading on Wednesday after the company’s strong earnings report sent its shares up nearly 40%. Forbes estimates her net worth at $3.4 billion as of Wednesday afternoon, compared with $3 billion earlier in the day. The jump followed Oracle’s disclosure of $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, contracted revenue that has yet to be recognised. The figures underline the company’s accelerating growth in cloud services and its expanding role in powering artificial intelligence workloads. Larry Ellison, Oracle’s co-founder, benefited even more from the rally. His net worth soared to an estimated $386.3 billion, making him the world’s second-richest person, up from $293 billion at the start of the trading day. “Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads,” Catz said on the company’s earnings call, citing new cloud contracts with firms such as OpenAI, xAI, Meta, Nvidia and AMD. Catz, who has been Oracle’s sole CEO since 2019, has overseen a more than 800% rise in the company’s stock price during her tenure. She previously led Oracle’s M&A strategy, completing high-profile acquisitions including PeopleSoft and Sun Microsystems. Analysts across Wall Street were surprised by the scale of Oracle’s performance. Deutsche Bank’s Brad Zelnick said he was “in shock, in a very good way,” while John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities said he was “blown away.” Bank of America analysts have forecast further upside in the stock on the back of Oracle’s strong revenue pipeline and AI-driven demand. Oracle's shares were already on the rise before the latest financial results. They increased by 45% this year through Tuesday’s close, four times the gain seen in the S&P 500. Its surge on Wednesday also boosted other AI stocks, including Nvidia, which rose 3.8%. In Asia, Nvidia suppliers rallied in Japan and South Korea, with Advantest Corp. up over 3% and SK Hynix Inc. increasing by 5.6%. The company's forecast underscores the need for global AI developers to step up their investments. OpenAI, an Oracle customer, predicts it will need trillions of dollars over time to invest in the infrastructure needed to develop and run its services. Major US companies have recently given investors grounds for optimism about the pace and sustainability of AI investment. Last week, Broadcom Inc. announced it had secured a major new customer in this sector. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Remaining CAPEX Obligation
URL: https://platformonomics.com/2025/09/remaining-capex-obligation/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T23:48:10Z
Full Content:
Read By Rather than further update the last post, we’ll start anew. In our preparation for this week’s Oracle earnings, we wrote: Absolute bestest most glorious company ever in entire universe of all time prepare awesome-sauce victory lap. With tomorrow’s earnings announcement the database vampire will permit us to bask in their greatness and invite us to contemplate why other companies even exist. Things are always so fabulous that the Oxford English Dictionary is considering replacing the word “superlative” with “Oracle”. Despite a mediocre quarter, Oracle stock price took that awesome-sauce victory lap (and then some). Oracle missed revenue and earnings expectations, reported slower growth than each of the much larger Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft, free cash flow went further negative, and CAPEX shrank to $8.5 billion from the previous quarter’s $9.2 billion. But it was a “bombastically scripted earnings call” for the ages. Oracle stock was up 36% today, maybe an all-time one day increase in valuation record. Kudos to Oracle for giving the market what it wanted to hear and to Larry for becoming the world’s richest man (doubtlessly a long coveted title). The stock rocketed based on Oracle announcing a $317 billion increase in their Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO), which is a non-GAAP metric of booked but not yet delivered revenue (SEC reported Deferred Revenue, which is the stricter portion of RPO, was $12.1 billion, up 29% from the previous quarter). My argument remains that Oracle is hyping future cloud revenue (that may or may not materialize), but neglecting the costs required to deliver and book that revenue. The iron law of cloud computing is no infrastructure, no revenue. And Oracle is a relative financial pipsqueak whose capital allocation abilities are already stressed. This post offers guidance for people furiously updating their Excel models that detail every parameter of Oracle’s next half-decade. A day after the earnings call focused on that $317 billion increase in RPO, we learned Open AI was responsible for $300 billion of that increase (how much that actually translates into SEC reported Deferred Revenue is a question for next quarter). Oracle stock is now a one-way bet on whether Open AI can raise hundreds of billions in new capital. Stargate “has struggled to get out of the gate” and Open AI is passing the hat for single digit billions instead of the desired trillions. Open AI’s projected losses are growing. Oracle tried to paint the RPO explosion as broad based, citing xAI, Meta, NVIDIA and AMD as new customers. xAi has no revenue, is itself struggling to raise money, and not many customers are going to be dumb enough to take a business dependency on Elon for AI. Meta is in the midst of a $600 billion AI mulligan (maybe – neither Zuck nor the CFO are sure actually how much they plan to spend). But Meta likely promised every well-compensated recent hire their own GPU clusters, and Oracle is a source. NVIDIA and AMD are merely recycling revenue from Oracle (but the SEC, like Congress, is on recess). And why don’t they talk about their biggest current customer? (ByteDance). If you are adding the new RPO numbers to your Oracle models, you also have to add the infrastructure costs, aka the Remaining CAPEX Obligation. Again, no infrastructure, no revenue. Let’s return to the AWS history, as it is a great proxy, but step through it in more detail than the last post. We have ten years of data that lets us directly compare annual CAPEX to revenue. We see AWS-specific CAPEX as a percentage of annual AWS revenue dropping from 60%, bottoming at 27% in 2023, and ramping back above 50% as the AI frenzy hits (they’re above 70% for the first half of 2025). Now lets look at same numbers for Oracle: You quickly notice Oracle is far less efficient than AWS, with CAPEX/revenue ratios in the triple digits ranging between 100% and 208% (the FY26 numbers are Oracle’s revenue and CAPEX guidance for the current fiscal year). This is consistent with Oracle being a noob when it comes to large scale data centers, as we have chronicled. But it also shows the absurdity of Oracle’s claims to be “asset pretty light” – they are vastly less efficient than AWS despite bragging about not owning data centers (“I know some of our competitors like to own buildings”). Despite giving up margin, Oracle is not even remotely seeing any advantage from not owning data centers (I guess it could always be worse). Type your email… Subscribe Now, as you update your five-year model for Oracle, you have to decide what CAPEX numbers go with that nearly geometric sequence of revenue increases. Some things to keep in mind as you pick parameters: So let’s throw out some numbers for the required CAPEX spend as a percentage of revenue (Oracle’s average over the last three years is 170%, which would be a level of CAPEX that exceeds all the new-found RPO). Pick your preferred numbers and enter them into your model: The last step for your updated model is to figure out where the money to pay for RCO is coming from. We detailed Oracle’s financial constraints in the previous post. Free cash flow is already negative. Oracle carries a fair amount of debt (though that debt/equity ratio looks better today!). And they allocate a lot of capital to Larry through both dividends and buybacks. What does Oracle’s capital allocation look like for the next five years that is consistent with your model?

September 10, 2025 19:06 ET | Source: TradeInvestNow.com TradeInvestNow.com New York, NY, Sept. 10, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The team at Tradeinvestnow.com invites you to join Professor Joel Litman and Whitney Tilson at the "Breakout 2025" livestream event on Wednesday, September 17 at 8 p.m. ET, where these two financial experts will collaborate to discuss a stock market anomaly they've identified and demonstrate the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool designed to help investors analyze stocks for potential growth opportunities. Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 event - Get all the details here Joel Litman's Breakout 2025 Event Overview The Breakout 2025 event will focus on a stock market anomaly identified by Joel Litman through a comprehensive study of over 3,000 stocks since 1994. This anomaly has appeared in companies across various sectors, including technology, retail, and energy, and is linked to significant price movements observed in recent market trends. The livestream will provide detailed information on how this anomaly functions and its relevance to the upcoming earnings season, which may influence stock price dynamics. Attendees will gain free access to the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, a tool developed by Litman to analyze over 5,000 stock tickers and assess their market potential based on his proprietary methodology. The event will also include a special report, Two Stocks to Plug into the Doubles Scanner Right Now, which examines two widely held stocks and their market outlooks. A guest speaker, a 50-year Wall Street veteran who has worked with figures like George Soros and Steve Cohen, will share additional insights on navigating current market conditions. The event aims to provide retail investors with analytical tools and perspectives typically reserved for institutional clients, fostering informed decision-making in a complex market environment. Breakout Profits: The Research Behind the Anomaly Joel Litman’s anomaly is based on a historical study analyzing stocks across multiple decades and industries. The research identified a recurring pattern in companies such as Nvidia, Lululemon, Southern Copper, Celsius, Hub Group, and Domino’s Pizza, as well as all seven of the “Magnificent Seven” stocks—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—prior to significant price movements. The study suggests that this anomaly is relevant to current market conditions, particularly as the earnings season approaches. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner utilizes this research to enable users to input stock tickers and receive immediate feedback on their market potential. The tool is designed to be accessible to investors of all experience levels, simplifying complex financial analysis and providing data-driven insights. Meet the Experts Joel Litman: Forensic Accounting Specialist Professor Joel Litman has nearly three decades of experience in financial analysis, having worked with firms such as Deloitte, Credit Suisse, and PricewaterhouseCoopers. Concerned by discrepancies in corporate financial reporting, he developed a proprietary valuation system to assess the true financial health of companies. His work includes predicting the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID market crash, as well as identifying companies at risk of significant declines. Litman provides research to over half of the world’s 300 largest money managers. He has lectured at Harvard, MIT, Wharton, and the Pentagon, and advised the FBI and U.S. Marine Corps War College. His focus is on transparency in financial reporting to equip investors with accurate data for decision-making. Whitney Tilson: Experienced Investor Whitney Tilson, known as “The Prophet” by CNBC, managed a hedge fund that grew from $1 million to over $200 million in assets over two decades. He has predicted the dot-com crash, the 2008 housing crisis, and the 2020 COVID market rebound, with appearances on 60 Minutes, CNBC, and Bloomberg. His 2015 60 Minutes investigation into Lumber Liquidators highlighted issues in corporate practices and impacted its market performance. A long-time follower of Warren Buffett, Tilson has attended 26 consecutive Berkshire Hathaway shareholder meetings and co-authored a book on Charlie Munger. His approach emphasizes identifying market opportunities and understanding broader economic trends. Breakout 2025 Event Details and Participation The Breakout 2025 event will be held on September 17, 2025, at 8 p.m. Eastern Time via livestream. To participate, individuals can reserve their spot by submitting their email address, which provides access to event updates, the Altimetry Doubles Scanner, and the special report. Attendees are encouraged to: The event is free to attend! Significance of the Breakout 2025 Event The Breakout 2025 event offers retail investors access to advanced financial analysis typically available only to institutional clients. By combining Litman’s forensic accounting expertise with Tilson’s market experience, the event provides a comprehensive framework for understanding stock market dynamics. The Altimetry Doubles Scanner empowers investors to analyze stocks independently, while the guest speaker’s insights add depth to the discussion. With the earnings season approaching, the event is timed to help investors prepare for potential market shifts. About Altimetry Research Altimetry Research is a boutique financial research and publishing firm providing individual investors with unique, unbiased investment recommendations and analytics. Primarily, they are guided by the knowledge that U.S. accounting guidelines – which American public companies are forced to follow – obscure the true results of a company's profitability, misleading investors. Instead of using traditional Wall Street analyses, they deconstruct them and reassemble them using their own Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS) – or Uniform Accounting, for short. This process shows them the true picture of a company's potential. Then they combine Uniform Accounting with additional, deep forensic analysis to consistently find mispriced companies poised for massive growth, which they detail for their subscribers.

Title: Restore Trust In Congress Act—Missteps And Mistakes
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewleahey/2025/09/10/restore-trust-in-congress-act-missteps-and-mistakes/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:46:24Z

ByAndrew Leahey, Contributor. Every few years, Congress remembers that it probably shouldn’t be allowed to play the stock market like a fantasy football league with insider information on plays. And, every time, opponents recoil in horror—not at the ethics violation, but at the idea that members may have to pay taxes if they are forced to sell their holdings. Now comes a bipartisan bill that, at least on paper, seeks to resolve this dilemma by banning individual stock ownership for members of Congress. At the same time, by way of a sweetener, lawmakers propose giving members a tax deferralon any gains from those sales. It is pitched as a compromise, but in reality, it’s a policy Frankenstein: half ethics reform, half boutique tax shelter, all bad for good government. The Restore Trust in Congress Act does what it says on the label. It prohibits members of Congress, their spouses, and their dependent children from owning or trading individual stocks, commodities, futures, or even derivative assets and options. In short, if it was passed as proposed, it would mean no more betting on Tesla or buying call options on defense contractors while simultaneously hammering out the next Pentagon budget. The bill requires current lawmakers to divest within 180 days, and gives new members 90 days from their swearing-in. It carves out the usual safe harbors—more abstract holdings like mutual funds, Treasury bonds, and index funds. Municipal bonds are still fair game, as well. The bill classifies itself as a federal conflict-of-interest statute, which would make divesting members eligible for preferred tax treatment under Section 1043 of the Internal Revenue Code. The provision is designed to allow government officials to defer capital gain taxes when they sell assets in compliance with ethics rules—provided they reinvest the proceeds in diversified investments like mutual funds. So instead of a clean ethics rule, we get an ethics rule plus a sweetheart deferral. Congress isn’t just instructing its members to clean up their portfolios before they swear-in—it’s offering them a spoonful of tax break to help the ethical medicine go down. The logic is simple on its face: if you want members of Congress to divest from conflicted asset holdings, you have to make it painless—if not enjoyable. In tax terms, apparently, there is nothing more painful than realizing the capital gains on long-held stock. The bill tries to remove that obstacle by offering a tax deferral through a certificate of divestiture, which is already available to certain executive branch officials. Supporters argue that this just levels the playing field—a curious defense. If the problem is public officials profiting from decisions they make in office, then the solution shouldn’t be contingent on making that transition tax-neutral. The financial inconvenience of paying capital gains taxes owed on investments isn’t some kind of constitutional crisis created by demanding a more ethical legislature, it’s a feature of a tax code that applies to everyone else. And since when do we need to incentivize ethics? Lawmakers are public servants, not reluctant volunteers conscripted into duty. If avoiding conflicts of interest is so burdensome, perhaps we’ve misunderstood what it means to serve in public office. If not, why haven’t we extended the same logic to judges or prosecutors? “Your Honor, we would very much like you to recuse yourself in this case—but please allow us to sweeten the deal for you.” This isn’t about fairness, it’s just about comfort. When we start redesigning ethics laws around comfort of the regulated class, we have lost the plot. And that’s when things start to get messy. For instance, it is worth noting that by extending tax deferral through the divestiture certificate process, we have created a perverse incentive where one might run for office just to claim the benefit. Section 1043 of the tax code was designed for executive branch officials entering roles where holding certain assets could create conflicts. Think, for instance, a cabinet member offloading ExxonMobil stock prior to taking over regulating oil markets. The trigger, however, is specific: the divestiture must be mandatory, and ethics related. This bill goes out of its way to unlock the tax break generally for members. This converts pursuit of public office into a viable tax strategy. Imagine a wealthy private equity partner with a $10 million unrealized gain in Meta. What’s cheaper, paying the IRS now or launching a well-funded congressional campaign in a friendly district? Suddenly, the Restore Trust in Congress Act looks more like the Monetize Your Portfolio via Congress Act. We already have enough folks running for office to boost their brand, sell a book, or land a television deal—do we really want to add “defer my capital gains” to the list of socially acceptable motives? Even if no one actually runs for Congress just for a tax break—and let’s be real, someone will—the existence of that incentive speaks volumes. The bill conflates ethics with tax relief and reinforces the idea that lawmakers need a sweet treat to behave ethically. It reduces public trust to a line item on a balance sheet that can be offset by a credit elsewhere. The fundamental question is whether we should be negotiating with members of Congress about the price of not using their office to line their own pockets. Do we really believe stock trading is inherently a conflict of interest? If so, ban it. If not, then stop pretending ethics reform is the goal and just admit this is eyewash. Public services isn’t supposed to be risk-free or profit-maximizing. It is supposed to be a privilege that comes with equal parts restraint. That isn’t punitive; it’s the whole point.

Title: Larry Ellison's Rise: How He Snagged the Title of World's Richest Person From Elon Musk
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/larry-ellisons-rise-how-he-snagged-the-title-of-worlds-richest-from-elon-musk-11807095

Oracle's transformation into an AI infrastructure powerhouse has catapulted Larry Ellison ahead of Musk to take the title of the world's richest person. The 81-year-old database pioneer's net worth surged by more than $100 billion following the company's earnings report Tuesday, according to calculations published Wednesday by Bloomberg, which called the move "the biggest one-day increase ever recorded" by its Billionaire's Index. Ellison owns about 1.16 billion shares, or about 41% of the company. As of Tuesday's close, those shares were worth around $280 billion. If Oracle's stock price holds near current levels, Ellison's stake in Oracle would propel his net worth to $393 billion, surpassing Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, whose net worth is $385 billion. The staggering wealth increase came after Oracle announced what CEO Safra Catz called an "excellent" quarter, signing four multi-billion-dollar contracts and booking $455 billion in future cloud infrastructure revenue. Oracle's market capitalization spiked to about $950 billion in intraday trading on Wednesday, up more than $270 billion in a single day. Ellison's gains topped Musk's record for single-day rise in net worth—$63 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Oracle reported quarterly revenue of $14.9 billion, up 12% year-over-year, with cloud infrastructure revenue jumping 55% to $3.3 billion. The company's forward-looking metrics were even more headline-making: Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO)—essentially contracts for future revenue—grew to $455 billion in value, an increase of 359% year-over-year. "Clearly, it was an excellent quarter, and demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure continues to build," CEO Catz told investors during Tuesday's earnings call. "I expect we will sign additional multi-billion-dollar customers and that RPO will likely grow to exceed $500 billion." The company expects cloud infrastructure revenue to reach $18 billion this fiscal year. Oracle's has transformed itself from a traditional database provider into a critical player providing the infrastructure for AI companies in a desperate race for computing power. "Oracle has become the go-to place for AI workloads," Catz told investors, saying the company had signed contracts with OpenAI; xAI, Elon Musk's AI company; Meta Platforms, Inc. (META); Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD); and others. While Ellison's fortune has grown with Oracle's AI boom, Musk's grip on the world's richest title has been loosening throughout 2025. The Tesla CEO began the year with a net worth of $420 billion, which has since fallen to about $385 billion as Tesla shares have declined by about 14% year-to-date. Tesla has struggled with increasing competition in the electric vehicle market and a softening in demand in key markets worldwide. Musk's wealth, tied primarily to his Tesla stake, has fluctuated wildly with the automaker's volatile stock price. Though it's worth noting that Tesla recently floated a new compensation package for Elon Musk, aimed at retaining him, and it's potentially worth $1 trillion. Ellison's record-breaking surge is part of the story of how AI infrastructure has become the new gold rush in tech, with Oracle positioning itself as the critical picks-and-shovels provider for companies racing to build their AI systems. His $100+ billion single-day gain—driven by Oracle's $455 billion in future cloud contracts—shows that the real money in AI may not be in building chatbots or autonomous vehicles, but in providing the computing backbone these technologies require.

The crypto exchange founded by twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss looks poised to be the next hot crypto IPO. Gemini Space Station on Wednesday raised the range at which it expects its initial public offering to $24 to $26; it still plans to offer some 16.7 million shares, indicating a market capitalization over $3 billion at the high end. The boosted price suggests strong demand from investors for the shares and follows a string of successful public debuts that includes industry peers like stablecoin operator Circle (CRCL) and institution-focused digital assets platform Bullish (BLSH). The original range was estimated at $17 to $19 per share. Gemini Space Station is expected to list on the Nasdaq exchange under the ticker symbol "GEMI." Earlier this week, Gemini secured a $50 million private investment from another exchange operator, Nasdaq (NDAQ), a regulatory filling shows. Nasdaq agreed to pay a per share price equal to the IPO for Class A stock, less underwriting costs and commissions. The Winklevoss twins, famous for their role in the social media network once called Facebook, now known as Meta (META), are also earmarking a set of shares for retail investors. The company expects as much as 30% of Class A shares will be offered to individual investors via brokerages including Robinhood (HOOD) and SoFi (SOFI). Gemini operates one of the better-known crypto exchanges in the U.S. and also has a credit card business. While its trading volume is a fraction of the much larger Coinbase Global (COIN), the company said tokenization and card payments represent "immense untapped potential" for its future growth.

Title: Klarna employees roast its return-to-office plan with emojis as IPO hits the market

Klarna may be celebrating its IPO and $15 billion valuation, but employees seem focused on another matter: return-to-office plans. Klarna informed employees last week that it's set to roll out a return-to-office policy later this month, citing the need to retain top talent that might otherwise leave for companies prioritizing in-person work, as Business Insider exclusively reported. Staff have reacted to the announcement with a wide range of emoji responses, according to a Slack post shared in a channel with roughly 3,000 workers and seen by Business Insider. Comments on the post were disabled, so employees expressed their reactions solely through emojis, which appear to signal strong disapproval of the plans. The responses were varied and, at times, humorous: 341 employees reacted with a sad face emoji, 167 used an emoji reading "no," 149 chose a sweat-faced sad emoji. Additional responses included 41 "this sucks" emojis, and 43 using an emoji based on the viral "Hide the Pain Harold" meme. A small proportion appeared to signal approval of the plans, including 19 thumbs-up emojis and 14 rocket ship emojis. Other popular reactions included 131 sad cat emojis, 90 facepalm emojis, 86 crying emojis, and 73 clown face emojis. Some employees went for more whimsical options: 62 selected the "Homer Simpson backing into a bush" emoji, and 17 used a child going down a slide saying "bye" emoji. Klarna declined to comment. Other tech companies, including Amazon, Dell, and Meta, have implemented RTO policies in recent years. The Swedish fintech said on Tuesday that it set its IPO price at $40 a share as it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Samuel Kerr, head of equity capital markets at Mergermarket, said the IPO's pricing is a "tremendous" result for Klarna and its shareholders. He said that all eyes would be on Klarna once trading begins, given the early volatility around recent IPOs. Investors, he said, will closely scrutinize the company's financials, particularly in light of recent losses. Klarna has seen double-digit growth in its users and gross merchandise value, but achieving profitability continues to be a challenge. Losses for the quarter ended June 30 surged to $52 million, up from $7 million a year earlier, even as revenue climbed to $823 million from $682 million. "That scrutiny and Klarna's answers on its evolution and growth could be the determiner of IPO success, as it's hard to draw too much of a parallel between broader fintech listings," Kerr said. In an F-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last week, Klarna disclosed that it has partnered with and paid over $16 million to climate impact nonprofits founded by the wife of its CEO over the past five years.Have a tip?

What's on deck: Markets: The stock market is turning into a ticking time bomb, and the growing mountain of rough economic data is the trigger. Tech: It's back to the office for Microsoft workers. And the AI team isn't getting a pass. Business: A first-hand account of buying an apartment in NYC as a Gen Zer. (Yes, it's possible!) But first, Air Apple. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's an iPhone, just make it thinner. The star of Apple's big, annual product reveal was the iPhone Air, a slimmed-down version of the popular smartphone. At a whopping 5.6 millimeters — that's less than a quarter-inch for metric system haters — Apple said the iPhone Air is thin enough to fit on a fingertip. The iPhone Air's smaller size comes with a few sacrifices. Its camera, internal chip, and battery are all a bit of a step down from its bigger siblings. And at $999, it's more than a base model iPhone, making it no bargain. However, Apple says it's making the most of its size, calling it "the most power-efficient iPhone we've ever made" and touting its durability. It might not be the groundbreaking announcement you were hoping for, but iPhone launches rarely are these days. A slightly improved camera here. A moderately better chip there. That's part of the reason why iPhone users hold onto their phones for a lot longer than Apple would like. Apple's big AI push last year was meant to encourage users to finally upgrade their phones, but Apple Intelligence mostly fell flat. So, if you can't attract them with the software, pitch them on the hardware! And the iPhone Air, if nothing else, is pretty impressive to look at. It also appears to have at least one convert. BI's Katie Notopoulos is very excited about the iPhone Air. She explained why the slimmed-down iPhone is exactly what she's been looking for. Still, arguably the toughest and most important critic wasn't impressed. Apple's stock finished the day down almost 1.5%. It wasn't just about the iPhone Air. BI's Sarah Jackson broke down all the big product announcements from Apple. Here are some of the highlights: The other iPhones: The iPhone 17 Pro's camera is comparable to eight professional lenses. It'll cost you at least $1,099, which is $100 more than the iPhone 16 Pro's starting price, but it has more storage (256 GB instead of 128 GB). If you're really trying to ball out, the iPhone 17 Pro Max starts at $1,199. Meanwhile, the entry-level iPhone 17 price of $799 is the same as last year. AirPods Pro 3: The big news here is a heart rate sensor for the gym bros/gals. That could serve as a bridge into more health-related products from Apple. There's also a Live Translation feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The new buds start at $249. Apple Watch: The biggest upgrades are battery life, a scratch-resistant screen, and a better display. The Ultra 3 ($799) can last up to 42 hours on a full charge, while the Series 11 ($399) and SE 3 ($249) will last 24 and 18 hours, respectively. 1. The labor market is a lot cooler than we thought — and not in a good way. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 911,000 fewer non-farm jobs were added from April 2024 to March 2025 than previously reported. Most major industry sectors, including leisure and hospitality, saw large downward revisions. 2. How long can stock investors keep ignoring bad economic data? The latest revision to the labor market (see above) wasn't good, and inflation is still a concern. Yet the stock market is already fully valued, and major indexes are sitting at record highs. Once investors flip their stance on the economic data, watch out, BI's Joe Ciolli writes. 3. Citi poaches a longtime IBM executive to pursue its AI ambitions. Shobhit Varshney, the firm's new head of AI, will report to Citi's chief operating officer and work closely with its chief technology officer, according to a memo sent to staff and seen by BI. About 175,000 employees already have access to Citi's AI tools. 1. One of Big Tech's last RTO holdouts is calling workers back to the office. Microsoft employees will be required to go in three days a week, according to an internal email sent to staff and seen by BI. The mandate will happen in three phases, starting at the end of February 2026. And if you're one of Microsoft's AI stars, the RTO guidelines are even stricter. 2. One step closer to mind control? The Pentagon just partnered with Phantom Neuro, a startup that wants to let users control prosthetic limbs with muscle memory. The startup received roughly $300,000 from the DOD's emerging tech group and raised $19 million Series A in April. 3. Verily is restructuring in anticipation of new investors. In a recent town hall meeting, CEO Stephen Gillett told staff that Verily is transforming to a C-corp business structure as it seeks a fresh round of investment. Employees were also told their stock was being revalued, dropping around 80% compared to their 2024 value, according to internal documents viewed by BI. 1. It's giving homeowner. BI reporter and "geriatric Gen Zer" Juliana Kaplan recently bought an apartment in New York City at 28 years old. With a little bit of smart saving and luck, here's how she did it. 2. Whoop's CEO believes in work-life harmony, not work-life balance. The difference is flexibility, the fitness-tech CEO explained in the latest installment of BI's Power Hours. He shared his daily routine, from early morning workouts to cold plunges and meditation. 3. Four-day RTO vs. eight weeks of severance. That's the balance some NBCUniversal employees are weighing in the wake of a return-to-office order set to begin January 5. Unusually, the offer isn't based on employee tenure — everyone gets eight weeks regardless of how long they've been there. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: Oracle Stock Up 94% On Growth Forecast. Learn Whether To Buy $ORCL

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle's stock soared after a report of a cloud contract with OpenAI and an optimistic forecast for its AI-driven cloud infrastructure.The company projects aggressive eight-fold growth in cloud revenue by FY30, leveraging its unique database and networking advantages for AI training and inference services.Key risks include high market expectations, intense competition, significant capital expenditure, and the potential for AI spending to slow. Oracle shares have soared 99% since the beginning of 2025 – with more than half of that gain coming in pre-market trading on Wednesday. Why did this happen? After all, the Austin-based tech company announced results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2026 that fell short of expectations. What sent Oracle stock soaring another 54 percentage points was the company’s outlook for the future of its cloud infrastructure business, according to CNBC. The future didn’t take long: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday afternoon that Oracle and Open AI agreed to “one of the largest cloud contracts ever signed," worth a reported $300 billion over five years. Will Oracle stock keep rising? The answer depends on whether the tech giant can beat investor expectations and raise guidance in future quarters. I think there is more upside to the stock for two reasons: However, over the longer-term, Oracle stock may plunge if companies stop investing so heavily in artificial intelligence. That could happen unless more of them reap economic benefits – such as faster revenue growth and considerable boosts in productivity. Oracle envisions very fast growth in its cloud infrastructure business. "We expect Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue to grow 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year — and then increase to $32 billion, $73 billion, $114 billion, and $144 billion over the subsequent four years," CEO Safra Catz in a statement. The OpenAI deal is a big a step in that direction. Oracle’s results for the quarter fell flat while the company’s growth forecast generated an outpouring of enthusiasm. Here are the key numbers: The question for investors is whether Oracle’s bullish growth forecasts suggest a continued rise in its stock. Here’s the bull case: Oracle’s latest earnings report suggests growth in demand and much higher revenue driven by companies seeking to benefit from AI. Oracle’s backlog is likely to grow even more. "We signed four multibillion-dollar contracts with three different customers in Q1," Catz said in a statement. Oracle expects to contract with several additional multibillion-dollar customers and for its RPO to exceed half a trillion dollars, Catz added. "We have signed significant cloud contracts with the who’s who of AI, including OpenAI, xAI, Meta, and many others," Catz said in investor call featured by Yahoo! Finance. Oracle is targeting two related AI markets – services for training large language models and for inference – generating content from a trained AI model. “Millions of customers are using those AI models to run businesses and governments,” Oracle co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison said in the investor conference call featured by the Wall Street Journal. “AI inference will be used to run robotic factories, robotic cars, robotic greenhouses, biomolecular simulations for drug designs,” he added. Oracle’s unique advantage for AI inference is its databases that store private business data. The company’s “new AI database will make it easy for those businesses to query or ask questions of their private data, all of which adds to the bill for Oracle’s AI inference services,” Ellison said, according to the Journal. Oracle is also investing in AI agents – which help people to achieve specific goals such as selecting, booking, and paying for flights and hotels for a journey, as I described in my book Brain Rush. “The new [applications] that we’re building, they’re nothing other than a bunch of AI agents that we generate that are linked together with workflow,” he added. Oracle enjoys another advantage over cloud services rivals. “I know some of our competitors, they like to own buildings,” Catz said, according to CNBC. “That’s not really our specialty. Our specialty is the unique technology, the unique networking, the storage — just the whole way we put these systems together,” she added. However, this potential comes with significant risks. The stock’s premium valuation reflects high market expectations – if the market shifts money out of big tech companies or Oracle fails to beat and raise every quarter, its stock could fall. Moreover, the high capital expenditure required to fund its expansion could reduce cash flow and highlights the financial risks involved in its ambitious plans. In addition, Oracle faces significant competition from AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure. While the urge to spend more on AI is currently powerful, if the economy goes into a recession, companies who buy cloud services may need to cut costs quickly to preserve cash. And since AI has yet to generate enough of a payoff to justify the investment, as I wrote last month in a Forbes article, such spending could be curtailed if the economy contracts. Last September, generative AI was looking to me like a big dud. While people were using ChatGPT to help them draft emails and reports, there was no killer app – akin to what the iTunes store did for the iPod or the electronic spreadsheet did for personal computers, I wrote in the Boston Globe. Last month, MIT reinforced this point with hard numbers. "Despite $30B-$40B in enterprise investment into generative AI, this report uncovers a surprising result in that 95% of organizations are getting zero return," according to a study – based on 150 interviews with professionals, a survey of 350 employees, and an analysis of 300 public AI deployments – from MIT’s NANDA Institute featured by SeekingAlpha. The main problem appears to be integrating AI into the enterprise. "Just 5% of integrated AI pilots are extracting millions in value, while the vast majority remain stuck with no measurable profit and loss impact," noted the MIT NANDA Institute report. If companies find ways to make AI pay over the next four years, Oracle’s cloud services rapid growth could continue. Analysts are mostly enthusiastic about Oracle’s prospects: One note of caution came from D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. While Lauria said Oracle’s projected cloud revenue figure was “absolutely staggering,” according to CNBC, the business is coming from Microsoft and Google who are “offloading their capacity to other data center providers. These are not organic customers to Oracle,” he added. While Wall Street is optimistic, 35 analysts who cover the stock set a price target of $263.93, according to TipRanks – meaning Oracle stock is 25% over-valued. I see the stock continuing to rise – at least until the company’s next earnings report.

Title: Apple’s ultrathin iPhone impresses fans but not investors

Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Good morning. Hello. It’s Jeremy here. First up, I want to wish Andrew, who normally writes this newsletter, a big congratulations on the birth of his new baby boy, who made his world debut yesterday! Andrew had to leave Fortune Brainstorm Tech early to greet his new arrival, but let’s catch him and you up on a few things he missed. Here were some highlights from yesterday: And don’t forget that you can watch the livestream of the conference’s final day here.Apple’s big “awe-dropping” hardware show yesterday ended up being more like a “meh dropping” (doesn’t quite have the same ring to it), at least as far as the company’s investors were concerned. The stock drifted lower in after-hours trading.While the new iPhone Air is impressively svelte and got phone aficionados talking, many of the other announcements—updated Apple watches, new AirPods—were more niche and unlikely to alter perceptions that the company has lost some of its former mojo. Fortune’s Dave Smith has a breakdown of the announcements below.Today, the tech world is eagerly awaiting another sort of debut—fintech Klarna’s IPO on the NYSE. The Swedish buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40, valuing the company at about $15 billion. That will earn a nice 6x return for venture capital firm Sequoia, which invested about $500 million in Klarna starting back in 2010, according to a story in The Information. But it’s a lot less than the $46 billion valuation the company achieved in a Softbank-led round in 2021 (a round that Sequoia pointedly did not participate in.) We’ll see how much the stock pops today on opening. Beatrice Nolan has more on Klarna in the news section below.Before we go, be sure to check out Leo Schwarz’s great profile piece on Ramp, the fast-growing fintech that is automating how corporate finance departments work.And also worth a read is Sharon Goldman’s feature on Cohere, the Canadian AI company that many considered an also-ran in the AI race but which is making a bid for renewed relevancy with a big hire from Meta, a new CFO, and a $7 billion valuation.Onwards…—Jeremy Kahn Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Fortune Tech? Drop a line here. Apple’s “Awe Dropping” event has wrapped—and the focus of Tuesday’s show was mobile devices: the iPhone, the Watch, and AirPods. In total, Apple unveiled eight new products, including a brand-new member of the iPhone family, the iPhone Air. Highlights include the AirPods Pro 3 with improved ANC, live translation, and built-in heart-rate tracking. Three new Watches, the Series 11 with blood pressure monitoring and better durability, the SE 3 with an always-on display and faster charging, and the rugged Ultra 3 with satellite connectivity and a record 42-hour battery. On the phone side, Apple introduced the iPhone 17 with a ProMotion display, upgraded cameras, and the new iPhone Air as a fresh model in the lineup. The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max bring lighter builds, ceramic shield backs, major camera upgrades, and the longest iPhone battery life ever. Here’s the full rundown of everything the tech giant announced at its annual event. The launches come as Apple leans on hardware innovation to buy time for its delayed AI strategy, with Wall Street watching closely to see if these devices can spark stronger upgrade cycles. — Dave Smith Klarna's long-awaited initial public offering (IPO) is finally here. The buy-now-pay-later financing firm is expected to price its shares at $40 per share, valuing the company at about $15 billion, significantly lower than the $45 billion valuation it achieved in 2021. Despite the lower valuation, major investor Sequoia is set to gain nearly $3 billion from its $500 million investment in the company over the last 15 years, per The Information. The fintech, which was once Europe’s most valuable VC-backed company, has been planning the listing for years but economic and political headwinds, including sweeping U.S. tariffs have delayed its market debut several times. Investors are hopeful the company could set a trend for high-growth fintech listings after a period of slowdown in both tech IPOs and M&A activity. Losses in the first half of the fiscal year and an internal AI pullback could cast a shadow over Klarna’s IPO. Investors will be watching closely to see if the company can pull off a strong market debut. — Beatrice Nolan As Congress considers new rules that restrict the sale of AI chips to China, Nvidia has a new strategy to protect the billion-dollar market. The Senate and the House are weighing rules that would require U.S. companies to prioritize domestic access to the technology before it can be sold abroad. To tackle this and protect the potentially $50 billion market, the chipmaker has painted the limits as left-wing paranoia pushed by a group of AI doomers, according to a report from The New York Times. Nvidia’s aggressive push has rattled Republicans backing the restrictions and pulled Washington into what is primarily a Silicon Valley-based clash between “accelerationists,” who want to supercharge AI growth, and “doomers,” who raise concerns about the technology’s risks. David Sacks, the White House AI czar, has reiterated Nvidia’s attacks, labeling the regulation advocates a “doomer cult.” On his All-In podcast, Sacks even suggested they should be “Loomered,” suggesting far-right activist Laura Loomer should campaign to get them dismissed. The Senate is expected to vote on the amendment, which could reshape the U.S.–China tech relations, as early as Tuesday. — Beatrice Nolan OpenAI’s largest investor is working with rival AI lab, Anthropic. Microsoft is set to use Anthropic’s tech for AI features in Office 365 after executives found Claude Sonnet 4 outperformed OpenAI’s GPT-5 in some tasks, according to a report from The Information. Microsoft has said the $30-per-month Copilot add-on already has over 100 million users, and analysts estimate it could be a $1 billion annual business. Microsoft will access Anthropic’s models through Amazon Web Services, and the move will blend Anthropic and OpenAI’s technology in the apps. It’s the latest sign that Microsoft is taking steps to lessen its reliance on its closer partner in the AI space. This isn’t Microsoft’s first pivot away from OpenAI: earlier this year, the company announced that its GitHub Copilot codewriting tools would use Anthropic’s models to power advanced “agent” features, rather than relying solely on OpenAI. The move comes amid months of negotiations between OpenAI and the tech giant over the ChatGPT maker’s plan to restructure its for-profit division in preparation for a potential public offering. — Beatrice Nolan PwC U.K. cuts entry-level hiring amid AI uncertainty. The firm's U.K. chief admitted that graduate hiring is “under pressure.” U.S. tech companies accused of enabling China’s digital police state. An AP investigation found that Amazon, IBM, and Dell helped build China’s surveillance state. Robinhood says its latest product will fix social media trading. The trading giant has a new app feature called “Robinhood Social” where users can follow prominent traders. Oracle soars on ambitious cloud growth forecasts. Oracle’s shares surged after projecting $144 billion in cloud infrastructure revenue by 2030. Meta’s new AI team is stirring up new tensions with old staff.

ByMartina Di Licosa, Contributor. Few things could make the average billionaire feel poor—The Forbes 400 list is one of them. There are now a record 900 billionaires in the U.S., meaning a record 500 people have amassed a ten-figure fortune but are still simply not rich enough to make the top 400 in 2025. It’s a tough list to crack, and getting tougher. Back in 1982, there were fewer than two dozen billionaires on the original Forbes 400, which required a minimum net worth of just $100 million to make the cut. Four decades later, it now takes $3.8 billion to make the ranking, up $500 million from just a year ago. More than 90% of last year’s list held onto their spot this year. Still, 19 billionaires worth $3.7 billion came up just short of stealing a place on the ranking. That includes design software firm Figma’s cofounder Dylan Field and athleisure brand Alo Yoga’s cofounders Danny Harris and Marco DeGeorge, as well as Dario Amodei and five other cofounders of AI juggernaut Anthropic (a seventh cofounder of the company, Christopher Olah, is also worth $3.7 billion but is Canadian). Another 11 billionaires missed the cut by just $200 million, with a $3.6 billion fortune. Those rich enough to make Forbes’ billionaires list but not rich enough to make The Forbes 400 also include some of the world’s most famous people. Embattled WWE boss Vince McMahon is $400 million too poor. Oprah Winfrey would need another $700 million to make the grade. Taylor Swift, who has added an additional $500 million to her fortune since Forbes first named her a billionaire in 2023 on the back of her global Eras Tour, is still $2.2 billion short. Several recent additions to the billionaires list missed this year’s Forbes 400 as well, including South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone (net worth: $1.2 billion apiece) and Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who has fallen from the billionaire ranks amid the fast-casual Mexican restaurant chain’s slumping stock price. There’s always next year for these billionaires. Just ask Robinhood cofounder Vlad Tenev, Dutch Bros coffee cofounder Travis Boersma, and the 12 other billionaires who made The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2025. The brains behind South Park got rich one offensive episode at a time. Now in its 27th season, the hit show has won four Emmys, and its creators ranked #1 on Forbes’ most recent list of the highest-paid TV showrunners. Parker and Stone became billionaires in July after they signed a $1.5 billion streaming deal to bring South Park to Paramount+ globally. The first active NBA player to become a billionaire, his athletic talent has earned him more than $500 million in pretax salary over the course of his two-decade career with the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and his current team, the Los Angeles Lakers. Then there’s his off-court earnings, upwards of $900 million pretax, from business ventures like production company SpringHill and endorsement deals with brands including Nike and Beats by Dre. Swift holds the record for the most albums to sell one million copies in a single week in the modern era, with seven of her albums, including 1989 (Taylor's Version) and The Tortured Poets Department, reaching that milestone in seven days. She toured her way into the billionaire ranks, joining the list in 2023 while traveling the globe on her Eras Tour, which generated more than $2 billion of revenue and ranks as the highest-grossing concert tour of all time. Her family made her famous, but most of Kardashian’s wealth comes from shapewear brand Skims, which she founded in 2019 and is expanding internationally with stores in London and Dubai. In 2022, she cofounded private equity firm SKKY Partners, which has invested in companies like UK-based luxury skincare brand 111SKIN and premium, truffle-based sauce and condiments purveyor TRUFF. Field cofounded web-based design company Figma in 2012 after dropping out of Brown University. In 2022, he agreed to sell his startup to Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal was killed by regulators. Figma went public in July 2025, and its stock more than tripled on its first trading day. It’s lost nearly 40% of its value since, with the company reporting slower sales growth and worse-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of 2025, as well as third-quarter guidance that disappointed analysts and investors. Londsdale got his start working for billionaire investor Peter Thiel's hedge fund. He is now the managing partner of $6 billion (assets) venture capital firm 8VC. He cofounded data mining firm Palantir in 2003; it now has a market capitalization of $370 billion. Lonsdale was also an early investor in Palmer Luckey's Anduril. Scale AI’s cofounder and former CEO briefly became the world’s youngest self-made billionaire in 2022, at age 25, after private investors valued his data labeling company at $7.3 billion. Then private markets plunged and knocked Wang from the billionaire ranks. He regained his title in 2024, when Scale raised $1 billion at a $13.8 billion valuation, and has held onto it ever since. In June, Wang’s fortune soared by $1.2 billion, to $3.2 billion, after Meta paid more than $14 billion for 49% of Scale, and Wang left Scale to become the social media giant’s new chief AI officer. As CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, Lutnick rebuilt the trading and investment management firm after 658 employees died in the 9/11 attacks. Now he’s serving in the Trump administration as Secretary of Commerce, focusing on tariffs, and has turned the company's management over to a trio of co-CEOs. Luckey got rich creating Oculus VR and, more recently, selling weapons. His defense startup Anduril boomed with the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. “We want to be the company that when the DoD needs something, we're the first people they think of,” he told Forbes at the time. Now he’s building crypto bank Erebor, which is awaiting regulatory approval. The Blackstone executive’s Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment (HBSE) owns stakes in the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers, the NHL’s New Jersey Devils, and the Premier League’s Crystal Palace. Blitzer also has stakes in the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, and he co-owns MLS squad Real Salt Lake. Harris and Degeorge began selling clothing together right out of high school. Today, their athleisure brand Alo Yoga is bringing in an estimated $2 billion in revenue and has been seen on influencers like Kendall Jenner and Georgina Rodríguez. In August, Harris told Vogue Business that the brand will be launching a line of leather purses priced in the thousands in an effort to break into the luxury market. Formerly the vice president of research at OpenAI, Amodei is now the CEO of AI firm Anthropic, which built chatbot Claude. He cofounded the company in 2021 with six other former OpenAI employees, including his sister Daniela Amodei. Anthropic raised $13 billion at a $183 billion valuation in early September.

ByBarry Libert, Contributor. Every day there are LinkedIn posts, as well as Forbes, NYT, and WSJ articles about the massive capital reallocation by customers and investors to AI from SaaS, foretelling the end of SaaS. Maybe this is right or maybe it is oversold. Who knows? Regardless, if you are a software customer, institutional investor, or even consumer, this tidal wave of migration – from SaaS to AI - is reshaping our world. The question is: What does this mean to you if you are a SaaS leader or investor? In short, this article will answer that question, as well as how to allocate your time and money to be a winner in this emerging market battle for time and money. In 2025, AI spending will approach $650B. You read that number correctly. And if that number doesn’t blow your mind – try this one. AI spending is growing at a mind-bending rate of more than 75% per year. Amazing - right? How about SaaS spending? Our tried-and-true business and investment darling over the past two decades is growing at a little over 18% per year (not too shabby). Stated differently, $300B will be invested this year in SaaS, which is half of the AI spend rate. Given these statistics, it’s clear that a war is emerging for a technological edge, as well as customer and investor dollars. Now that everyone knows what is at stake, the battle lines are being drawn. To understand this battle ground for dollars better, let’s start with the brutal facts that should keep SaaS investors and leaders up at night: What does this mean to you? From my perspective, there are a few emerging trends, about which I have written before, starting with the AI rallying cry - To Be or Not to Be All-In-AI is The Only Question. The AI winners understand this and are attacking traditional SaaS companies on three primary fronts: The brutal question: Is driving 30 MPH the same as driving 100 MPH (think of MPH as analogous to yearly growth rates - 30% CAGR versus 100%). The answer is - definitely not. And for many reasons: different growth rates are dependent on different boards, leaders, products, technologies, cultures, and GTM motions. All of these factors taken together create a dilemma for even the best SaaS leaders and investors. Witness Salesforce’s recent share price performance -- their stock is off nearly 30% – due to a lack of AI preparedness, products, and skills. Given this reality, here are three factors that you need to seriously consider at your next team off-site and board meeting. In short, ask yourself, do you have the right: Workday, Atlassian, Box, HubSpot and Monday, to name just a few SaaS leaders, are now responding - embedding AI everywhere in everything they do. Though they have NOT YET seen a real boost in revenues from their AI spending, they are making hard decisions. To ensure your success, follow these 7 steps: As the CEO of Palantir, Alex Karp says: “The world will be divided between AI haves and have-nots. At Palantir, we plan to power the winners.” The market agrees: Palantir is one of today’s most valuable companies trading at atmospheric heights (>50X revenues). Whether or not you agree with their valuation is not the point. Just see their positioning, product offerings and growth rates and know that we are living a new reality. The Bottom Line: A war is being waged between AI and SaaS for investor and customer dollars. SaaS leaders and investors can still win, but they need to be All-in-AI. There is no time to wait. It’s a high-stakes battle for the future of software customer spending. That is the simple reality of it all. It is up to you as a SaaS leader and investor. Allocate your capital wisely or risk being left behind while also generating sub par financial returns for your people and investors.

Morgan Stanley says a few cybersecurity firms are primed for further upside as companies pump money into streamlined security platforms. The share prices of Palo Alto Networks, CrowdStrike, and Zscaler should all get a boost in the coming 12 months, the bank's software equity research team said in a note earlier this month. The three companies are best-positioned for a mega wave of "platformization" for cybersecurity products, with firms looking to integrate and simplify their cyber-defense structures. All three of the stocks offer solutions across multiple parts of the security chain, like devices, cloud, applications, and networks. "We expect platformization to continue as security needs grow against tight budgets, environments get more complex, a problem that only gets worse with AI," analyst Meta A. Marshall, the lead author of the note, wrote. Morgan Stanley expects the $270 billion cybersecurity market to grow by about 12% a year over the next few years. The bank also cited its CIO survey data showing that firms intend to spend 50% more on cybersecurity products than general software products in the years ahead as a reason to be bullish. On Morgan Stanley's list of 15 software stocks to watch, two key drivers of forward returns are revenue growth (for long-term returns) and free-cash flow margins (for short-term performance), the bank said. Among those on the list, the median projected revenue growth is 11.8% and the median projected free cash flow margin is 26.6%. Palo Alto Networks has projected revenue growth of 13.6% for next year and 38.3% projected free cash flow margins, part of the reason that Morgan Stanley has an "Overweight" rating on the stock. As of September 2, the stock has 9% implied upside to its price target, the bank said, and 36% upside in its bull case scenario. "In our view, Palo Alto Networks should be one of the few leading platform vendors in security longer-term, especially as the platformization strategy continues to gain momentum and more security vendors consolidate," the bank said of the firm. For shares of CrowdStrike, which MS gives an "Equal Weight" rating, the bank sees 9% upside as a base case and 30% upside in its bull case. Its projected revenue growth is 21.5% and its projected free cash flow margin is 31%. Finally, Zscaler, which the bank recently upgraded to an "Overweight" rating, should climb 16% to the bank's price target, it said. Its bull-case scenario is a 44% gain. Its revenue is projected to grow by 18.3% and its projected free cash flow margin is 27.3%. "We think ZS could cement itself as the next true platform (along with PANW and CRWD)," the bank said.

Against the backdrop of grassland ecological degradation, grassland transfer has become a crucial pathway for optimizing livestock resource allocation and promoting sustainable pastoral development. Based on survey data from 383 herder households in the farming–pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia, China, this study applies Heckman models, mediation models, and moderation models to examine the impact of digital technology on herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions and the underlying mechanisms. The results indicate that digital technology significantly increases both the probability and the scale of grassland leasing-in among herders. Moreover, digital technology indirectly promotes grassland leasing-in by enhancing scale efficiency. Notably, strong social networks weaken the facilitating role of digital technology in grassland transfer, whereas weak social networks strengthen it. The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is especially pronounced under environmental regulations with weak incentives but strong constraints. Finally, compared with ordinary herders, digital technology has a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in only for new-type operators. In addition, the impact of digital technology is more pronounced among groups with higher levels of education.

Grasslands are among the most widely distributed vegetation types worldwide [1], covering about 40% of the global land area (excluding Antarctica and Greenland) and supporting the livelihoods of nearly one billion people [2]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. Grasslands also act as ecological barriers closely connected to socioeconomic development and regional ecological security [3,4]. They perform critical ecological functions, including soil and water conservation, water source retention, and biodiversity protection. China boasts abundant grassland resources, with its prairie area accounting for approximately 12% of the global total, ranking first in the world [5]. According to data from the Third National Land Survey, grassland area is second only to forest land, making it the second largest land use type in China, covering about 27.56% of the national territory. Consequently, they constitute the largest terrestrial ecosystem in the country [6,7]. However, weak management systems and increasing human disturbances have created severe ecological challenges [8], including shrinking grassland area, declining quality, reduced grazing capacity, and further degradation such as desertification and salinization [9]. Statistics show that nearly 90% of China’s usable natural grasslands have degraded, expanding at a rate of two million hectares annually [10]. Facing these impacts, grassland remains the fundamental resource for herders’ livelihoods. Grassland transfer is a key mechanism for optimizing resource allocation in animal husbandry [11]. Since the reform era, the household contract responsibility system has led to resource misallocation across labor, grassland, livestock, and productive assets [12]. To address resource scarcity and improve production efficiency, the grassland transfer system emerged [13], currently referring mainly to the transfer of grassland management or usage rights [11]. Therefore, in this study, “grassland leasing-in” refers to the practice whereby a herder leases-in grassland from another right holder—via formal contractual arrangements or informal agreements—to acquire grassland management rights. Compared with farming households, herders face more severe resource imbalances, making grassland transfer a vital means to balance resources, break the cycle of degradation and poverty, and promote sustainable development in grassland-based animal husbandry [12]. Herders’ grassland transfer behaviors typically take three forms: non-participation, leasing-in, and leasing-out. In theory, herders engage in land transactions to improve welfare [14]. Leasing-in occurs when herders rent additional grassland to achieve scale economies and higher profits [15], while leasing-out often reflects unstable livestock income and the attraction of stable subsidies, rent, or off-farm employment [12,16]. Non-participation may result from constraints such as limited capital [17–20], ecological concerns [21,22], subsidy policies [23], high transaction costs [24], perceived risks [25], or incomplete markets [19]. A notable emerging constraint is the digital divide, which limits herders’ access to digital tools and platforms that could facilitate transactions. Digital technologies can address these barriers by reducing transaction costs, improving information flow, and enabling off-farm employment [26]. This aligns with broader research on agricultural land transfer, which highlights four mechanisms: reducing transaction costs through digital platforms, enhancing social capital via virtual networks, mitigating information asymmetry, and facilitating labor reallocation to non-agricultural sectors [27,28]. Together, these mechanisms are reshaping traditional patterns of pastoral resource allocation. Despite this progress, several research gaps remain. First, little attention has been paid to the relationship between digital technology and grassland leasing-in, as most studies focus on farmland transfer. Second, existing analyses emphasize information acquisition, while the efficiency-enhancing role of digital technology remains unexplored. Third, because grassland ecosystems are fragile, grassland transfer is strongly influenced by policy, suggesting that the effect of digital technology may vary across institutional contexts. Fourth, differences in resource endowments among production entities lead to divergent transfer behaviors, but few studies examine how digital technology affects these differences. To address these gaps, this study focuses on four key questions: What impact does digital technology have on grassland leasing-in? What role does scale efficiency play in this relationship? Does the effect depend on social networks? Does the impact of digital technology vary with external environments and herders’ characteristics? Exploring these questions is crucial for advancing digital rural construction and transforming animal husbandry development models. According to Schultz’s theory, the introduction of modern production factors is essential for transforming traditional agriculture [29]. As a new production factor, digital technology provides abundant data for pastoral production, streamlines information acquisition [30], enables rapid dissemination and integration of agricultural and pastoral information [31], and supports herders’ grassland leasing-in decisions by improving information availability. This reduces information asymmetry [32,33], lowers information costs, and thereby facilitates grassland transfer. More importantly, digital technology leverages data as a new production factor to exert its enabling function [34]. In animal husbandry, it represents an innovation in production methods, shifting the dominant mode of production from reliance on manual labor to intelligent machinery. Traditionally, livestock rearing requires extensive manual intervention, which constrains the scale of operations. Theoretically, enabling fewer people to manage larger herds could overcome the main bottleneck to higher output and profitability [35]. Digital technology addresses this constraint by replacing routine, repetitive, and some non-routine tasks, generating a substitution effect [36]. This shift from mechanization to intelligent systems reduces labor intensity and expands the management scope and capacity of each laborer. For example, real-time livestock tracking reduces the time spent locating animals, while remote herd monitoring minimizes unnecessary labor inputs. As a result, with equal or even reduced labor input, herders can manage larger herds, overcome scale bottlenecks, reduce management costs, and enhance scale efficiency. Improved scale efficiency further lowers unit production costs and substantially increases expected returns from expansion. Based on the rational-economic agent assumption, herders are therefore more likely to lease in grassland to expand production and pursue higher returns. However, adopting digital technology also involves risks—such as data tampering, cyberattacks, and unauthorized access—that may undermine operational integrity and reduce expected gains without sufficient safeguards. As Yazdinejad et al. [37] note, smart farming and precision agriculture systems face increasing security threats, requiring robust countermeasures such as encryption, intrusion detection, and secure communication protocols. Furthermore, while enhancing scale efficiency, digital technology also mitigates livestock disease and management risks, strengthening herders’ confidence in leasing-in and managing grassland. Ultimately, it improves managerial capacity and cost advantages, potentially increasing future demand for additional grassland to exploit scale economies. Based on this theoretical analysis, the following hypotheses are proposed: H1:‌ Digital technology positively facilitates herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. H2:‌ Digital technology indirectly promotes herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior by enhancing scale efficiency. Social relationships include both strong ties and weak ties. Strong ties usually exist between individuals with frequent interaction and close relationships, often yielding repetitive or redundant information. By contrast, weak ties connect individuals with diverse socio-economic characteristics, such as different experiences, knowledge, and backgrounds, and are generally superior in providing novel, effective, and non-redundant information [38]. A key function of social networks in grassland transfer is information acquisition. Herders obtain policy information and grassland-related details from their social networks. As a non-market pathway, social networks disseminate policy information and help herders understand other stakeholders’ perspectives. The larger the social network, the more diverse the information herders can access [39]. In information-scarce pastoral areas, choosing transaction partners based on personal relationships is the primary way to mitigate risks [40]. The main advantage of strong social networks is their emotional support, which constrains both parties, reduces contract breaches and land degradation, lowers moral hazard and transaction costs, and has historically supported grassland transfer processes [41]. However, with the development of digital technology, the role of strong social networks may be declining. Digital technology reduces information asymmetry, enabling impersonal transactions, and also provides formal contract safeguards, reducing dependence on relational contracts. Unlike strong ties, weak-tie networks connect groups with different education levels, incomes, and ages, giving them a comparative advantage in accessing non-redundant information. When informal reciprocity cannot meet herders’ demand for grassland resources and expansion, they must seek additional lease information, and the “information bridge” function of weak ties becomes critical [42]. However, transactions in weak-tie networks often require institutional safeguards [43]. Without digital tools, herders with sparse social ties lack institutional support, hindering independent transfers. Conversely, effective use of digital tools can fill these institutional gaps by providing information exchange and formal safeguards, even for sparsely connected herders or transactions between strangers, thereby promoting grassland leasing-in through weak-tie networks. Thus, different social networks may moderate the effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in in distinct ways. Based on this theoretical analysis, we propose: H3:‌ Strong social networks weaken, whereas weak social networks strengthen, the positive effect of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. The adoption and diffusion of technology are widely recognized as being shaped by individuals’ educational attainment [44]. Theoretically, herders with higher education generally have stronger abilities in acquiring and processing information, which enables them to better use digital platforms—for example, for online leasing, price comparison, and contract signing. Empirical research supports this view: farmers with higher education show greater willingness to adopt smart agricultural technologies [45]. These cognitive advantages allow them to use digital tools more effectively in practice. By contrast, herders with lower education often face barriers to adopting and applying digital technologies. The higher cognitive costs of understanding tools, operating platforms, or evaluating risks may cause reluctance or mistrust, thereby reducing the utility of these technologies. Consequently, higher education is likely to enhance the positive impact of digital technology on grassland transfer decisions. At the same time, leasing behaviors are also shaped by other individual characteristics and external policy environments [46–49]. In recent years, China’s livestock production system has shifted from traditional household contracting to new-type operators—such as large-scale households, family ranches, cooperatives, and livestock enterprises—which has accelerated grassland transfer [50]. This is mainly because, first, unlike ordinary herders, new-type operators earn most of their income from livestock production, prioritize long-term development, and typically require large-scale land transfers to meet specialized production needs [51,52]. By contrast, ordinary herders increasingly diversify their livelihoods and engage in pluriactivity [53,54]. According to comparative advantage theory, they reduce labor input in livestock production, focus less on long-term benefits, and prefer to increase non-pastoral income, thereby reducing their likelihood of leasing-in grassland [55,56]. Second, as market-oriented organizations [57], new-type operators have stronger risk-bearing capacity than ordinary herders, who are constrained by subsistence and risk aversion, thereby increasing the probability of leasing-in. Third, higher intensification among new-type operators their adoption of digital technologies, further increasing the probability of leasing-in [58]. Fourth, contiguous operations among new-type operators optimize production efficiency, further increasing incentives for leasing-in. Moreover, intensified economic activities place substantial pressure on grassland ecosystems [59]. In response, China implemented the Grassland Ecological Compensation Awards (GECA) policy to protect grassland ecology. As the world’s largest ecological compensation program in coverage and beneficiaries, GECA reshapes herders’ expected returns from grasslands and alters their land management strategies [60]. Under grassland degradation, GECA focuses on livestock reduction and grazing bans through incentive and restrictive instruments: restrictive policies impose economic or reputational penalties on non-compliant herders to increase violation costs, while incentive policies provide subsidies to offset losses and externalities from destocking, thereby stabilizing economic expectations. As a result, herders’ leasing-in behavior shows heterogeneity under different environmental regulations. Specifically, when subsidies fail to cover the opportunity costs of destocking, herders cannot rely on compensation alone, making leasing-in a rational choice for profit. At the same time, strict penalties for overstocking raise the marginal costs of non-compliance, compelling herders to acquire grassland legally to avoid penalties. Thus, we propose the following hypothesis H4:‌ The impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in is heterogeneous. This study develops a conceptual framework examining digital technology’s impact on grassland transfer (Fig 1). Source: Prepared by the authors based on the study’s conceptual design.

The study sites lie in the agro-pastoral ecotone of the southern Greater Khingan Mountains and include Keshiketeng, Bairin Right, Bairin Left, Ongniud, and Ar Horqin Banners. Minors were excluded from the survey population. Before data collection, all participants were informed of the research purpose and provided written consent, confirming voluntary participation. The project was approved by the School Research Ethics Panel of the corresponding institution (approval code: NNDKY2024004). A stratified random sampling design was adopted at the sumu (township) level, covering 31 sampled sumu. Within each stratum, interviewers randomly selected household identifiers from updated administrative rosters of registered herder households provided by local authorities. One adult decision-maker from each household was interviewed face-to-face. The target sample was proportionally allocated across strata according to the number of registered herder households, ensuring representativeness across banners and sumu. After fieldwork, records were screened using a pre-specified protocol. Following rigorous quality checks, 29 questionnaires were excluded due to critical errors, substantial missing values, or extreme outliers that could not be corrected. These excluded cases were distributed across different townships and did not cluster in any specific category of herders, minimizing the risk of systematic bias. The remaining 383 valid questionnaires produced an effective response rate of 93%. Two primary sources of potential bias are recognized. First, non-response and temporary unavailability during peak husbandry activities may bias the sample toward time-constrained households. This was mitigated by scheduling visits outside peak hours when possible and conducting in-person callbacks. In the empirical analysis, household and operational controls as well as township fixed effects were also included. Second, differences in comprehension, especially among older or less educated respondents, may cause measurement errors. To minimize such errors, trained interviewers explained questionnaire items in detail. Econometric analyses using Heckman and IV-Heckman specifications, along with robustness checks, confirmed that the main results remained robust. This region was selected for two reasons. First, the third national land survey shows that the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 81.56 million hectares of grassland, accounting for 20.56% of China’s total and 46% of the region’s landmass. Of this, natural pasture covers 71.88 million hectares, artificial pasture 1.91 million hectares, and other types 9.49 million hectares. The grassland ecosystem is highly diverse, with eight major categories, 21 subcategories, and 476 types, forming a rich repository of natural resources. Surveying this area thus provides comprehensive and representative herder samples. Second, as a key agro-pastoral transition zone, it is one of China’s most ecologically vulnerable and poverty-concentrated areas [61,62], making it particularly relevant for studying grassland transfer. The distribution of the survey area is shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.g002 Grassland leasing-in is a two-stage decision process: first, deciding whether to lease-in grassland, and second, determining the transfer area. Sample selection bias may arise because some herders who wish to lease-in may abstain due to individual constraints. Consequently, only samples that exhibit leasing-in behavior provide observable area data. To address this issue, the Heckman model is employed. Stage 1: Transfer Participation Decision A probit regression models herders’ binary transfer decision using fitted values and residuals of digital technology variables alongside exogenous covariates: where denotes the grassland leasing-in decision (1 = yes; 0 = no), represents digital technology variables, is a vector of control variables, denotes the intercept, and are parameter estimates, and is the stochastic error term. Stage 2: Transfer Area Determination An OLS regression estimates the transfer area using fitted values and residuals of digital technology-related variables with exogenous predictors: where indicates the grassland leasing-in area, and are as previously defined, is the intercept, and are parameters, denotes the error term. In the Heckman model, technology promotion is used as the identifying variable. It affects herders’ decisions to lease-in grassland but does not directly influence the scale of leasing. The rationale is that agricultural technology extension is a key policy instrument for knowledge dissemination [63]. When organized by local governments, such campaigns change herders’ perceptions [64], and improved cognition is expected to generate more rational behavioral responses [65]. Existing studies also show that cognitive levels significantly influence farmers’ willingness to engage in land transfer [66]. However, without sufficient capital and labor, exposure to technology promotion alone cannot increase the feasible scale of leased grassland. Thus, technical publicity satisfies the relevance conditions for influencing participation in leasing without directly affecting the leased-in area. Nevertheless, the above estimations may still suffer from endogeneity issues arising from omitted variables, measurement errors, or reverse causality. To address this concern, the present study employs the IV-Heckman model to overcome potential sample endogeneity. Following prior research [67], we use the “digital technology adoption rate within the same sumu (township)” as an instrumental variable for individual adoption. The rationale is twofold: first, the township-level adoption rate is highly correlated with individual adoption, as herders within the same township face similar livestock production environments and share common infrastructure. Second, conditional on control variables, township-level averages do not directly determine an individual household’s leasing scale or decision, which depend on household-specific resources and preferences. Hence, this variable satisfies both the relevance and exogeneity requirements for a valid instrument. Theoretical analysis suggests that digital technology may indirectly affect grassland leasing-in decisions through the mediating channel of scale efficiency. To test this mechanism empirically, we apply the causal mediation framework developed by Baron and Kenny [68] and extended by Wen [69]. Given the binary nature of the dependent variable, we use the nonparametric bootstrap procedure for mediation testing proposed by Preacher [70], which accommodates dichotomous outcomes without distributional assumptions. where denote the mediator variable (scale efficiency), denotes the grassland leasing-in decision, represents digital technology variables, and is a vector of control variable. To empirically assess the moderating role of social networks, the baseline model is augmented with interaction terms between digital technology and strong or weak social networks. The formal specification is as follows: Here, denote strong and weak social networks of herder household. Following previous studies [27], grassland transfer decisions are measured using two indicators: (i) a binary variable for leasing-in participation, and (ii) a continuous variable for the acquired grassland area. Digital technology is the primary explanatory variable. Despite improvements in network infrastructure in agro-pastoral regions, a secondary digital divide has emerged. This divide reflects competence gaps in using digital devices, retrieving information, and engaging in online marketing, and has become a major constraint limiting herders’ access to digital benefits [71]. To quantify digital technology use in livestock production, we employ a binary indicator based on herders’ self-reported adoption of digital technologies (e.g., video monitoring, traceability systems, positioning devices, drones, or smart feeding systems). Households that adopt at least one technology are coded as 1, and non-adopters as 0. Scale efficiency is the mediating variable. It is derived from Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) using DEAP 2.1 software, based on an input-oriented model with variable returns to scale (VRS). Inputs include pastureland (operated grassland area), labor (hired and family labor valued in monetary terms), and capital expenditures (forage, breeding services, fuel, fixed-asset depreciation, and other inputs), consistent with previous studies [72]. The output variable is the total pastoral production value. The moderating variables are strong and weak social networks. Strong ties mainly derive from kinship, close friends, and familiar neighbors, and their maintenance requires substantial gift-giving and ritual obligations [39]. Accordingly, “interpersonal expenditure” is used as the proxy for strong social network [73]. Weak ties lack strong emotional bonds, and “communication expenditure” effectively captures households’ access to broader information [74]. Consistent with prior studies, communication expenditure serves as the proxy for weak social network [75]. The model controls for pastoral household characteristics, operational attributes, and geographic heterogeneity. Individual characteristics encompass household head’s age, health status, education, and political status; household traits include dependency ratio, non-pastoral employment, per capita livestock income, and livestock income share; operational features control for per capita grassland area, per capita livestock scale, barn-feeding duration, and unit production cost. In addition, township-level dummy variables are included to capture regional fixed effects. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics for the key variables. Overall, about 16% of pastoral households participated in grassland transfer, with an average transferred area of 218 mu. In addition, 39% of households adopted digital technologies in production. For individual characteristics, household heads had an average age of 49 years, generally reported good health, and attained an education level equivalent to junior high school, with only a small proportion serving as village cadres. For household characteristics, families showed relatively low dependency ratios and a clear trend toward non-pastoral livelihoods. Per capita livestock income averaged 55,200 yuan, with livestock husbandry remaining the primary income source. From an operational perspective, households managed an average per capita grassland area of 310 mu and held 96 sheep-equivalent units per capita. Barn-feeding was the predominant rearing method and was associated with higher unit production costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t001 Table 2 reports the baseline results on the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in. In Columns (1) and (2), the coefficients of digital technology are positive and statistically significant at the 10% and 5% levels, respectively. The average marginal effect in Column (1) is 0.0619, implying that households using digital technology are 6% more likely to participate in grassland leasing-in than non-users. Column (2) further shows that adopters lease in about 509 more mu of grassland. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t002 Columns (3) and (4) address endogeneity from reverse causality and sample selection. Results indicate that the coefficients of digital technologies remain positive and significant. The Wald test is significant at the 1% level, and the first-stage F-statistic is 31.97, confirming instrument validity. This confirms that digital technology promotes grassland leasing-in even after controlling for endogeneity. Hence, Hypothesis 1 is validated: digital technologies significantly increases both the likelihood of grassland leasing-in and the transferred area. Among personal characteristics, age negatively affects the transferred area. Older households tend to prioritize livelihood stability, and acquiring larger areas involves greater uncertainties and risks. Reduced labor capacity with age also leads households to retain contracted grasslands for subsistence instead of expanding through transfers. Political status exerts a positive effect, since village cadre household heads have greater access and capacity to acquire grassland. Regarding household characteristics, a higher livestock income share reduces the transferred area. One possible explanation is that more specialized pastoral households typically practice stall-feeding for longer durations, thereby reducing their demand for transferred grassland area. For operational characteristics, per capita grassland area positively affects transfer-in, whereas confinement feeding duration and unit production costs exert negative effects. Longer confinement reduces grazing demand, while higher costs economically constrain households and limit expansion. To further address potential sample selection bias, the propensity score matching (PSM) method was employed. As reported in Table 3, the PSM results show that households adopting digital technologies lease in about 123 more units of grassland. These findings confirm the robustness of the baseline estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t003 To further validate the reliability of the PSM estimates, a balance test was conducted, and the outcomes are reported in Table 4. As shown in Table 4, most standardized biases were substantially reduced after matching, with all falling below the 20% threshold [76]. Furthermore, post-matching t-tests for all covariates were insignificant, confirming that the assumptions of common support and balance were satisfied. These results further confirm the robustness of the estimates. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t004 Following prior methodology [77], this study uses grassland rent as an alternative measure of grassland leasing-in and applies a Tobit regression model for robustness testing. The results reported in Table 5 indicate that the coefficients of digital technology remain significantly positive under this specification, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the baseline findings. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t005 A broader range of digital technology tools adopted by herders indicates a higher level of digital technology adoption. Accordingly, this study replaces the primary explanatory variable with the number of digital technology tool types as an alternative measure and re-estimates the baseline model. The results in Table 6 show that, under this specification, the diversity of digital technology tools has a significantly positive effect on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby reinforcing the robustness of the previous results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t006 Since a lower proportion of livestock income in total household income indicates reduced reliance on pastoral activities—which may lead to more discretionary grassland leasing decisions [27]—this study conducts a robustness test by excluding households with livestock income shares below 20%. The models and control variables remain unchanged for re-estimation. The results show that, even after sample exclusion, digital technology continues to exert significantly positive effects on both grassland leasing-in participation and transferred area, thereby confirming the robustness of the regression outcomes (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t007 Table 8 presents the results of the mediation analysis for scale efficiency. The estimates indicate that digital technologies significantly improve scale efficiency at the 1% level, with adoption increasing scale efficiency by approximately 0.07 units relative to non-adopters. Scale efficiency also exerts a significantly positive impact on grassland leasing-in decisions at the 1% level, suggesting that improvements in efficiency substantially increase the likelihood of leasing-in. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t008 The mediation test shows that the confidence interval of the indirect effect excludes zero, whereas that of the direct effect includes zero, confirming a statistically significant indirect effect but an insignificant direct effect. These results confirm that digital technologies influence herders’ leasing-in decisions indirectly through scale efficiency, with the mediation effect accounting for 26.21% of the total effect. The proposed pathway “Digital Technology → Scale Efficiency → Grassland Leasing-In” is empirically supported. Mechanistically, digital tools substitute for traditional herding methods, thereby reducing management costs and enhancing scale efficiency. Higher scale efficiency allows herders to achieve greater output per unit of input, which in turn incentivizes grassland leasing-in. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical evidence supporting Hypothesis 2. Prior to empirical estimation, the variables of strong and weak social networks were mean-centered to mitigate multicollinearity [78]. Table 9 reports the estimation results for the moderating effects of social networks. The results show that strong social networks have a significantly positive coefficient at the 5% level, whereas their interaction with digital technologies is significantly negative at the same level. This implies that although traditional strong ties enhance the probability of leasing-in, their facilitating role diminishes once herders adopt digital technologies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t009 By contrast, weak social networks display insignificant direct effects, yet their interaction with digital technologies is significantly positive at the 5% level. This suggests that although weak ties alone do not foster leasing-in decisions, digital technologies unlock their latent value for adopters. The mechanism operates through two complementary channels: digital technologies enhance herders’ management capacity, while weak social networks supply critical information on leasing opportunities. This technological–informational complementarity generates synergistic effects that substantially facilitate leasing-in decisions. Overall, these findings provide robust empirical support for Hypothesis 3. We further examine whether the impact of digital technologies on grassland leasing-in differs across varying intensities of environmental regulation. To address sample size constraints, households were split into two subsamples—above-mean and below-mean groups—so as to ensure statistical robustness. Following the implementation outcomes of the grassland ecological subsidy and reward policy, herders with grazing ban enforcement intensity above the mean were classified as the “strong-restriction” group, whereas those below the mean comprised the “weak-restriction” group. Likewise, herders with grazing ban incentives above the mean were labeled as the “strong-incentive” group, while those below the mean were categorized as the “weak-incentive” group. To estimate the probability of leasing-in participation, a Probit regression model was employed, given its suitability for binary dependent variables. As shown in Table 10, digital technologies exert a significantly positive effect on grassland leasing-in within the weak-incentive group. Specifically, column (2) shows that a one-unit increase in digital technology adoption raises the probability of leasing-in participation by 9.50%. In contrast, the effect is statistically insignificant for the strong-incentive group. Likewise, in the strong-restriction group, digital technology adoption exerts a significantly positive effect: column (8) indicates that each additional unit of adoption increases the probability of leasing-in by 9.52%. By contrast, the effect remains insignificant for the weak-restriction group. Taken together, these findings underscore that the effect of digital technologies on leasing-in is conditional on the regulatory context. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t010 This heterogeneity can be interpreted as follows. Under weak incentives—where subsidies fail to offset economic losses from grazing bans—digital technologies allow herders to expand production by leasing additional grasslands, thereby compensating for subsidy shortfalls. Under strong restrictions, where grassland scarcity is exacerbated, digital technologies assist herders in acquiring legal grazing rights through leasing, thereby enabling compliance while optimizing resource allocation. We further distinguish between two categories of production entities: new-type operators and ordinary herders. Respondents were classified as new-type operators if they were professional large-scale households, family ranch managers, or members of specialized herders’ cooperatives, while all others were categorized as ordinary herders. Since this study focuses on individual households and data on leading enterprises and agricultural service organizations are scarce, the definition of new-type operators is confined to the three groups mentioned above. Based on the Probit model, results reported in Table 11 indicate that the coefficient of digital technology adoption for new-type operators is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. The marginal effect estimates further suggest that a one-unit increase in digital adoption raises the probability of grassland leasing-in by 11%. By contrast, the effect for ordinary herders remains statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the heterogeneous impact of digital technology adoption across different types of production entities. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t011 Since herders with different educational backgrounds vary in their ability to absorb new knowledge, technologies, and ideas, their production decisions may also differ accordingly. Based on the sample characteristics, households with more than nine years of education (above junior high school) were classified as the high-education group, while those with nine years or less (junior high school and below) were defined as the low-education group. The regression results are presented in Table 12. For the high-education group, digital technology adoption exerts a significant positive effect on grassland leasing-in. The marginal effect estimates suggest that a one-unit increase in adoption raises the probability of leasing-in by 11.76%. By contrast, the effect for the low-education group is statistically insignificant. These findings highlight the benefits of digital technology adoption are greater among more educated herders and provide empirical support for Hypothesis 4 (Table 12). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.t012 This study provides a systematic examination of the multiple pathways through which digital technologies influence herders’ decisions to lease in grassland. The empirical analysis demonstrates that such technologies not only exert a direct positive effect on the likelihood and scale of grassland leasing but also generate indirect benefits through the mediating role of scale efficiency. By enabling herders to overcome constraints on operational expansion and to optimize the allocation of production factors, digital adoption helps break through traditional bottlenecks. The analytical framework also incorporates multidimensional contextual factors—such as social networks, environmental regulations, the type of production entity and educational level—to reveal the multifaceted nature of digital transformation in pastoral regions. Further evidence suggests that the interaction between digital technologies and social networks is not uniform. In settings characterized by strong social networks, the traditional advantages of these networks tend to weaken in the digital era; conversely, in weaker networks, digital tools can unlock considerable latent value. This finding expands the research perspective on the interplay between social capital and technology adoption, implying that digitalization may reshape the structure of social capital in pastoral communities. The heterogeneous effects associated with environmental regulation further reveal that the influence of digital technologies is more pronounced in contexts where incentives are limited yet regulatory constraints are strong, highlighting the critical role of institutional environments in shaping technological impacts. Moreover, the benefits of digital adoption are found to be concentrated primarily among new types of production entities. This indicates that the digital divide in pastoral areas is rooted less in access to technology per se than in disparities in organizational capacity and specialization—an imbalance that, to some extent, runs counter to the inclusive development goals of current policy. The contributions of this study are twofold. Theoretically, it develops and empirically validates a “digital technology–scale efficiency–grassland leasing” pathway model, elucidating the moderating roles of social networks and institutional environments, and thereby enriching the research framework linking digital technologies with land transfer processes. Practically, the findings offer targeted guidance for formulating differentiated policies for digital pastoralism: on one hand, technology promotion strategies should be tailored to match varying social network structures and institutional conditions; on the other, policy should focus on narrowing the organizational gap that drives the digital divide, ensuring equitable benefits across diverse production entities through targeted training programs and institutional safeguards. International experiences provide additional context for interpreting these results. Studies on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau indicate that digital technologies have been highly effective in grassland monitoring [79], yet their broader development remains dependent on policy frameworks and public investment due to uneven infrastructure provision [80]. In New Zealand, such technologies have created new opportunities to enhance both the sustainability and productivity of grasslands and pastures [81]. In African pastoral areas, the introduction of mobile communication and other digital tools has markedly improved herders’ access to information on forage availability, water resources, and weather conditions [82]—an advantage particularly significant in weakly connected social networks, where it can expand the range of potential transactions. Similarly, research on the European ruminant industry has shown that the adoption of digital technologies is strongly correlated with herd size; compared with small-scale herders, those managing larger herds are more inclined to integrate advanced technologies into their operations [83]. Collectively, these cases reinforce the central conclusion of this study: while digital technologies hold substantial promise for improving grassland resource management, their effectiveness is shaped by social networks, policy support, and the type of production entity. Limitations remain. The cross-sectional dataset cannot capture dynamic impacts, and leasing-out behavior—often closely linked to leasing-in—is not examined. Future research should use panel data and an integrated framework covering both leasing-in and leasing-out to generate more comprehensive policy insights. Using micro-level survey data, this study empirically investigates the impact of digital technologies on herders’ grassland leasing-in behavior. The analysis produces four key insights. First, adopting digital technologies optimizes the allocation of grassland resources and significantly increases both the probability of herders participating in transfer-in and the scale of transferred areas. Second, digital technologies indirectly enhance the probability of transfer-in by improving scale efficiency, highlighting their role in factor allocation. Third, strong social networks tend to weaken, whereas weak social networks moderately amplify, the positive influence of digital technologies on transfer-in. This pattern identifies social capital structure as a critical determinant of digital dividends. Fourth, the impact of digital technology on grassland leasing-in varies with the intensity of environmental regulation and the type of production entity. Specifically, digital adoption has a significant effect on leasing-in under weak-incentive and strong-restriction environments. Moreover, compared with ordinary herders, its positive effect is stronger for those with higher educational attainment and for new-type operators. Taken together, these findings suggest that digital technologies function not as universal enablers but as context-dependent catalysts, with their benefits concentrated where institutional conditions and organizational capacity are most aligned. Based on the above analysis, this study proposes the following policy recommendations: First, promoting inclusive digital technology initiatives is essential. Beyond general advocacy, local governments and industry associations should provide last-mile connectivity subsidies to households in remote pastoral areas, ensuring stable internet access across villages and seasonal camps. This effort can be complemented by distributing “starter digital kits”—such as GPS ear tags, collars, and grass-yield sensors—to low-income herders. At the community level, shared digital service centers with computers, internet access, and trained facilitators should function as hubs for troubleshooting and equipment maintenance. For herders with lower levels of education, governments and local livestock departments should provide regular “one-to-one” or “peer-to-peer” digital literacy training. These programs should emphasize practical skills—such as mobile application use, operation of grassland leasing platforms, online price comparison, and digital contract signing—to help herders overcome barriers to digital adoption. Second, weak social networks can be leveraged as informational bridges by developing officially endorsed digital platforms for grassland transfer. These platforms should include standardized listing templates, searchable land-availability maps, and secure e-contract modules. To boost weak social networks, these platforms should incorporate open bidding functions and transparent transaction records accessible to all registered users. Trust among unfamiliar users can be strengthened through third-party credit scoring based on transaction history and performance insurance mechanisms that automatically compensate counterparties in case of breach. Third, the targeted cultivation of digitally enabled new-type operators—such as cooperatives and family ranches—should be prioritized. This requires tailored digital solutions (e.g., automated feed dispensers) together with capacity-building grants linked to measurable adoption outcomes. Subsidized technical advisory visits can support new-type operators in optimizing their operations, while peer-learning networks should diffuse best practices to smaller, traditional herders, thereby lowering technological barriers through spillover effects. Finally, strengthening the synergy between environmental regulations and digital technologies is essential. In practice, satellite-based grassland monitoring should be combined with real-time alerts to notify herders of grazing limits or degradation risks, enabling compliance before penalties occur. Local authorities should implement compliance-linked incentives, such as reduced land rental fees or direct payments for maintaining stocking rates within carrying capacity thresholds. To ensure fairness, these incentives should be delivered through the same digital platforms used for land transactions, with clear eligibility criteria and transparent, auditable disbursement processes. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0331914.s001 (XLSX)
