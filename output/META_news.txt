The company that began 2024 in turmoil after Sam Altman's dramatic return has morphed from a cautious non-profit company to an AI powerhouse worth $157 billion. With a $13 billion investment from Microsoft and a deal to power Apple iPhones, the company is on track to generate $11.6 billion in revenue. Game over for all the other suckers trying to elbow their way into the AI market? Hardly. The money flooding into AI continued to reach tsunami proportions throughout 2024, with billions of dollars going into funding dozens of worthy competitors around the world, ranging from China’s Moonshot AI to Paris-based Mistral. During the last week of November alone, Anthropic and Elon Musk's xAI pocketed $4 and $5 billion respectively. Investors who once saw OpenAI as the new big thing in tech are spreading their bets across a field of nimble, hungry competitors and anything ending in AI could be the next frontrunner—especially after delays from OpenAI, including Sora, its ballyhooed audio cloning tool (and, supposedly, its next GPT model.) It seems like decades since ChatGPT burst onto the scene with its revolutionary chatbot, which users could communicate with as easily as talking to a friend. (The chatbot launched in November 2022 and added speech in September 2024.) Almost overnight it made Google search look antiquated, something that the olds use. These days, it’s probably the first thing a GenZ thinks about when someone says “AI.” The company that sparked the AI revolution with ChatGPT pushed the boundaries of AI capabilities in 2024 after the boom of GPT-3.5, releasing its multimodal GPT-4o in May with an unprecedented 88.7% score on the MMLU benchmark. By September, its new o1 model—which is supposed to handle complex reasoning—raised the bar again, achieving 83.3% accuracy on International Mathematics Olympiad questions—a massive leap from GPT-4o's 13.4%. With over 200 million weekly active users, OpenAI's influence ran so deep that Google, deep in the throes of the Innovator’s Dilemma, suddenly began to fear for its $160 billion search business. But money and fame don't guarantee a happy ending, especially in tech. Anyone remember the Blackberry? Google certainly isn’t going the way of the Blackberry any time soon. Besides, it’s not like it was caught with its pants down. OpenAI was launched in December, 2015 and two months later, the search giant unveiled its new Gemini Ultra foundational model, with the capacity to process 2 million tokens of context—making OpenAI’s GPT-4 look light weight. AI is so integral to Google that CEO Sundar Pichai announced the company is moving from mobile to an "AI-first" strategy. And not a second too soon: The switch to Gemini boosted the popularity of Google One—the tier that offers access to Gemini Ultra—to over 100 million subscriptions 24 hours after its release. We just crossed 100M Google One subscribers! Looking forward to building on that momentum with our new AI Premium Plan (launched yesterday) offering AI features like Gemini Advanced, plus Gemini in Gmail, Docs + more coming soon. https://t.co/m7zAVop7P6 pic.twitter.com/sMdwJeq0iU — Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) February 9, 2024 Google is not just flexing technical muscle; ChatGPT is still widely used but Google may be onto something. Its foundational model also powers its RAG, short for "retrieval augmented generation," platform NotebookLM, which was first conceived to help people handle huge amounts of information and data on big amounts of files. The product didn’t move a needle until an update changed the way people used RAG models. Welcome, Google’s podcast generators. That feature alone was enough to boost the model’s popularity, and increase user engagement with a pretty active Reddit community, interesting social experiments and even some business applications to explore. “I think we’ve learned a lot in the last year; what is really resonating with people, what is really useful, how they’re using it every day,” Raiza Martin, a product manager at Google Labs, told The Independent. Meanwhile, OpenAI has given us a voice mode to talk to, still keeps its 128k token context window, and under legal threat, removed its horny Scarlett Johanson voice. The Gemini lineup has been key for Google’s outstanding performance. Since January 2023, its stock price doubled, reaching an ATH on July 10, 2024. Smaller than Google, but probably as important in terms of its role in the boom of AI chatbots this year is San Francisco-based Anthropic. Founded by former OpenAI researchers, Anthropic emerged as OpenAI's most formidable challenger in 2024, turning heads with explosive growth and deep-pocketed backers. The rivalry between ChatGPT and Claude, Anthropic’s suite of large language models, is the equivalent of the Cold War in AI culture. When one company releases a feature, the other immediately strikes back. The two models are always competing for the top spot in the LLM Arena and the community is always trying to decide which one is the best. Anthropic’s revenue grew over 1,000% this year after the launch of Claude 3.5 Sonnet in June, with a major part powered by third-party API users. Anthropic's rise mirrors the early days of OpenAI, but with an even steeper trajectory. And the investments keep flowing in. Amazon has poured $8 billion into the startup, while Google agreed to invest up to $2 billion. These cash infusions were also probably strategic bets from tech giants hedging against OpenAI's dominance, and a mirror of a proxy war between cloud computing providers, with Microsoft supporting OpenAI to benefit Azure versus Amazon supporting Claude to benefit AWS. Anthropic and OpenAI mine the gold, whereas Microsoft and Amazon basically sell the shovels. Anthropic's success is not just due to its models’ quality. Overall, the company pushes for a broader shift in the AI landscape. While OpenAI chased consumer popularity, Anthropic focused on specialized models that prioritized safety, betting that enterprise customers would pay premium prices for targeted solutions. In Europe, French startup Mistral AI raised eyebrows by securing $1 billion in funding and a $6 billion valuation in June. Its open-source models are matching GPT-4's capabilities at a fraction of the cost. To put this in perspective, this means, according to calculations by Trending Topics, that "Mistral AI is worth €105m per employee," making it the most valuable startup in European history. A recent upgrade called “Le Chat,” is being positioned as Mistral’s ChatGPT killer. It offers basically everything ChatGPT does—for free. It provides good outputs, handles code, generates images, supports agents and browses the web in real time. And Mistral is just getting started, with a planned expansion into the United States and a new office in the belly of the beast in Palo Alto, California. Chinese firms aren't just copying anymore—they're innovating. Even with a major embargo imposed by the United States in an attempt to stifle innovation, companies like Baidu, Alibaba, and Baichuan AI, backed by massive government support, are developing models tailored for emerging markets in Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. They're building a parallel AI ecosystem that could rival anything coming out of San Francisco. Huawei, the massive telecom giant supported by the state, for example, released its own OS and is embedding it into its lineup of smartphones and home devices, creating a fully functional ecosystem. Another Chinese model, Yi Lightning beats GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the LLM Arena, the new Deepseek has come to compete against OpenAI’s reasoning model o1, and Baidu’s Ernie reached 100 million users in December 2023 and boosted its user base to over 200 million users in April 2024 According to the World Economic Forum, China’s AI market is estimated to top $61 billion next year with VCs pouring over $120 billion into AI ecosystems. Believe it or not, Meta plays the role of the good guy in this story. While competitors such as OpenAI and Anthropic fought over market share with expensive, locked-down models, Mark Zuckerberg's company took a different route: open sourcing its technology. Llama 3.2, released in September, showcases just how far Meta's open-source strategy has come. The model processes both text and images, powers everything from augmented reality apps to visual search engines, and with Meta looking to work with U.S. government agencies to use its model on national security applications. And beyond government and corporations, the Llama-powered Meta AI chatbot is a pretty promising ChatGPT competitor. Recently expanded into dozens of countries, the chatbot can generate images of similar or arguably better quality than Dall-e 3 and even animate them (which ChatGPT cannot), search the web, handle coding tasks, and imagine scenes on the spot. Beyond that, Meta has other generative AI models for audio generation, video editing, segmentation, drawing animation, and more With Llama 4 around the corner in 2025, promising even better handling of text, voice, and images, Meta's betting that open beats closed every time. The numbers back up Zuckerberg's gamble. Meta AI, the company's answer to ChatGPT, racked up 500 million monthly users, with India leading the charge. Over a million advertisers jumped on Meta's AI bandwagon in September alone, cranking out 15 million AI-generated ads. The company's revenue shot up 18.9% year-over-year to hit $40.6 billion in Q3, with ad impressions climbing 7% while prices rose 11%. All this AI goodwill doesn't come cheap. Meta's dumping $38 billion into capital expenditure this year, mostly on AI research and the hardware to run it. That includes cramming its data centers with 350,000 of Nvidia's prized H100 AI chips by year's end. But Zuckerberg's playing the long game. By partnering with cloud giants AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure to host Llama models, Meta's building an ecosystem that could reshape how AI technology spreads—and who profits from it. Not bad for a company that lost almost 75% of its value when it started to focus on the "metaverse" and grew 600% since its shift to artificial intelligence as its key business model. Is OpenAI still king of the hill? Technically, maybe. At least it is the most recognizable—and valuable—AI startup in the scene. But the hill itself has changed. The race isn't about raw power anymore—it's about trust, accessibility, and real-world impact, and a few of these areas, notably trust and safety, are a bit murky right now for Sam Altman’s unicorn OpenAI's early lead has evolved into a complex web of specialized players, each carving out their own niches. Some focus on consumer applications, others on enterprise solutions, and a few brave ones tackle the fundamental research that could unlock AGI. For the immediate future, Sam Altman seems very confident OpenAI can reach AGI next year, which would put OpenAI on top of the hill for probably a long, long time if—and this is as “if” as it can get—they succeed. However, other very respected and talented experts, like Meta’s chief of AI research Yan LeCun, believe such achievement is accomplishable in around 10 years or so. Whether you decide to be optimistic or pessimistic will depend on who’s your favorite rockstar. That said, the real winner of 2024's AI race is the users. Competition drives innovation, but it also forces companies to address concerns about safety, privacy, and accessibility. This is why the Amodei brothers left OpenAI to found Anthropic and why Ilya Sutskeyver left to found Safe Superintelligence. This is why Huawei developed its own mobile OS and used domestic technology to build one of the best phones of the year, why developers come up with customized, better versions of the most popular AI models, and why AI as a technology has become a social phenomenon in the last two years. As these AI titans battle for supremacy, they're building tools that transform everything from how we work to how we create and communicate. And that 'one AI to rule them all'? Maybe that was the wrong question all along. In 2025's AI landscape, diversity will likely play an important role. And that might be exactly what we need.

As executives enthusiastically talked about the results with Google's employees at an all-hands meeting the following week, it was clear that Wall Street viewed things differently than the company's workforce. "We've noticed a significant decline in morale, increased distrust and a disconnect between leadership and the workforce," one employee wrote in a comment that was read by executives at the meeting. "How does leadership plan to address these concerns and regain the trust, morale and cohesion that have been foundational to our company's success?" The comment was highly rated on an internal forum. "Despite the company's stellar performance and record earnings, many Googlers have not received meaningful compensation increases" another top-rated employee question read. That meeting set the stage for what would be a year of contrasting takes from the company's vocal workforce. As Google faced some of the most intense pressure its experienced since going public two decades ago, so too did CEO Sundar Pichai, who took the helm in 2015. Pichai oversaw a steady stream of revenue growth this year in key areas like search ads and cloud. The company rolled out groundbreaking technologies, rounded out its AI strategy despite a slew of embarrassing product incidents and saw its stock price rise more than 40% as of Thursday's close, ahead of the S&P 500 but trailing rivals Meta and Amazon. Over the course of 2024, many staffers questioned Pichai's vision following product mishaps in the first half of the year as well as internal shake-ups and layoffs, according to conversations with more than a dozen employees, audio recordings and internal correspondence. As the second half of the year progressed and Google rolled out a number of eye-catching AI products, Pichai's standing improved, though some skepticism remains, sources told CNBC. After the introduction of ChatGPT in late 2022, the tech industry saw an influx of AI products from Microsoft, with its Copilot AI assistant, and Meta, which placed its Meta AI chatbot in the search functions of its apps, as well as from hot startups like OpenAI and Perplexity. The popularity of those tools has eaten into Google's grip on U.S. search. The company's share of the search advertising market is expected to dip below 50% in 2025, which would be the first time falling below that mark in more than a decade, according to research firm eMarketer. Google responded to the pressures from new AI tools with offerings of its own. The company in 2024 rebranded its family of AI models as Gemini and released a number of products that were well received. But in its scramble to play catch-up, the company also released a pair of AI products that initially proved embarrassing. In February, Google launched Imagen 2, which turned user prompts into AI-generated images. Immediately after it was introduced, the product came under scrutiny for historical inaccuracies discovered by users. Notably, when one user asked it to show a German soldier in 1943, the tool depicted a racially diverse set of soldiers wearing German military uniforms of the era. The company pulled the feature, and Pichai told employees the company had "offended our users and shown bias," according to a memo. Google said it would take a few weeks to relaunch Imagen 2, but it ended up being six months before it was revived as Imagen 3 in August. "We definitely messed up on the image generation," Google co-founder Sergey Brin told a small crowd at a hacker house in March, in a video posted to YouTube. "It was mostly due to just not thorough testing." The launch of AI Overview in May caused a similar reaction. That product showed users AI summaries atop Google's traditional search results. Pichai hyped the product, calling it the biggest change to search in 25 years. Once again, users were quick to find problems. When asked "How many rocks should I eat each day," the tool said, "According to UC Berkeley geologists, people should eat at least one small rock a day." AI Overview also listed the vitamins and digestive benefits of rocks. Google responded by saying it would add more guardrails to AI Overview for health-related queries but said the mistakes weren't hallucinations, and were rather just rare edge cases. Search Vice President Liz Reid told employees at an all-hands meeting in June that AI Overview's launch shouldn't discourage them from taking risks. "We should act with urgency," Reid said. "When we find new problems, we should do the extensive testing but we won't always find everything and that just means that we respond." Beyond its AI blunders, Google also saw its greatest regulatory challenges to date in 2024. In August, a federal judge ruled that the company illegally holds a monopoly in the search market. The Justice Department in November asked that Google be forced to divest its Chrome internet browser unit as a remedy for the ruling The DOJ's request represents the agency's most aggressive attempt to break up a tech company since its antitrust case against Microsoft, which reached a settlement in 2001. The remedies are expected to be decided next summer, and Google has said it will appeal, likely dragging out the situation a couple more years, but the company faces more antitrust hurdles. In a separate case, the DOJ accused the company of illegally dominating online ad technology. That trial closed in September and awaits a judge ruling. In October, a U.S. judge issued a permanent injunction that will force Google to offer alternatives to its Google Play app store for Android phones. After the ruling in October, Google won a temporary pause on the ruling, meaning it won't have to open up Android to more app stores yet. Amid the external pressure, Google notched some notable victories particularly toward the end of 2024, leading to a more positive sentiment from people within and outside the company. Google successfully launched its most powerful suite of new Gemini models that underpin all of the company's AI products, including its lightweight model Gemini Flash, which has been popular among developers. YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters surpassed $50 billion. In the third quarter, Google saw the fastest-growing cloud business across the big tech players, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. The company has also seen double-digit revenue growth for each of the past four quarters and launched Trillium, its powerful sixth generation Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, which were also found to have powered Apple's AI models. Despite the blunders, AI Overview reached nearly 1 billion monthly users by the end of October. Demand for AI software has also driven consistent growth for the company's cloud infrastructure. And Google launched an impressive video generation product, Veo 2, this month as well as an updated AI note-taking product, NotebookLM. Beyond AI, Google in December announced Willow, a chip the company calls its biggest step in the march toward commercially viable quantum computing. The Waymo self-driving car unit was also a bright spot, expanding its robotaxi service to three cities and laying the groundwork for even more expansion in 2025. The company has delivered 4 million fully autonomous rides this year, with plans to commercially launch in Austin, Texas, and Atlanta next year. But as Pichai approaches a decade running Google and starts his sixth year as CEO of parent Alphabet, questions remain about his ability to guide the company into the future. Internally, employees routinely criticize leadership on the company's Memegen messaging board, and some have aired their grievances publicly. "Google does not have one single visionary leader," a Google software engineer wrote in a LinkedIn post earlier this year that received more than 8,500 reactions. "Not a one. From the C-suite to the SVPs to the VPs, they are all profoundly boring and glassy-eyed." In October, Google announced it would shake up the leadership of its ads and search division. The company replaced longtime search boss Prabhakar Raghavan with Nick Fox, a deputy of Raghavan's and a career Google employee. Raghavan was given the title of "chief scientist," but internally, he is now listed as an "IC," or individual contributor. Google also shifted the team working on its Gemini AI app to the Google DeepMind division, under AI head Demis Hassabis. Employees praised Pichai's leadership shuffle, but some complained that the moves should've happened sooner. Notably, some employees were perturbed when Raghavan addressed employees at an all-hands meeting in April, when he urged them to move faster, according to several people who spoke with CNBC. Raghavan noted that the staffers working to fix the failed Imagen 2 tool had increased their workloads from 100 hours a week to 120 hours to correct it in a timely manner. Pichai has made efforts to get Google back to its nimble startup-like culture. When addressing employees, Pichai often name-checked co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page to remind them of Google's scrappy roots. He's flattened the company, removing 10% of middle management, according to audio of a December all-hands meeting. And in the spring, Pichai greenlit a hackathon, allowing employees to build using Google products that have yet to be announced. Pichai has also personally joined meetings with Google's Labs team and enabled them to move quickly on products like NotebookLM, one of the company's hit AI products in 2024. After Brin's hacker house appearance in March, some employees internally joked he should retake the helm, nostalgic for what they perceived as a visionary leader devoid of corporate speak. Brin co-founded Google with Page in 1998, but he stepped down as president of Alphabet in 2019. Brin, who remains a board member and a principal shareholder with a stake worth more than $140 billion, began appearing more frequently on campus starting in 2023, as part of an effort to help ramp up Google's position in the hypercompetitive AI market. Employees, particularly working in AI and DeepMind said they've seen Brin walking around the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters throughout the year and have been able to ask him questions for projects they're pursuing. Despite Brin's reemergence, several employees told CNBC they're doubtful he could adequately run what has become an increasingly larger and complex corporation. Employees said that although Pichai didn't strike them as particularly visionary or as a wartime leader, it's hard to find someone better suited for the job, given all the complexities of Alphabet. The key quandary remains: move too early and risk widespread criticism; move too late and risk missing the boat. Through the year, morale inside Google wavered. Efforts to cut costs across the company in order to invest more in AI resulted in some teams feeling bifurcated and created yet another challenge for Pichai. Within the company's AI and DeepMind divisions, morale is mostly high, according to employees, boosted by hefty investments. Elsewhere, the vibes have been marred by cost cuts, bureaucracy and declining trust in leadership, employees said. DeepMind and AI teams have held off-sites, team-building activities, and have much bigger travel and recruiting budgets, people familiar with the matter said. In the spring, the company moved employees out of an eight-story office on San Francisco's waterfront Embarcadero street and replaced them with AI and AI adjacent teams. A meme posted internally in November summed it up. The meme featured a photo of the cast of "Wicked" actors, where one, labeled "execs" looked longingly at one fellow actor labeled "Gemini" while ignoring the other beside her, which was labeled as "users." A Google spokesperson contested the idea that AI workers are receiving favorable treatment and said higher travel and recruiting budgets are not exclusive to AI teams or DeepMind. "Most Googlers, regardless of team, continue to feel positively about our mission and the company's future, and are proud to work here," the spokesperson said. A few employees say they're no longer incentivized by the prospects of landing a promotion, which have become harder to achieve, and rather by the hope of avoiding layoffs. Despite slashing 12,000 jobs, or roughly 6% of its workforce, in 2023, Google has continued eliminating roles this year. In her first public statements as Google's CFO, Anat Ashkenazi, told Wall Street in October that one of her top priorities would be to drive more "cost efficiencies" across the company in order to invest more in AI. "I think any organization can always push a little further and I'll be looking at additional opportunities," Ashkenazi said. That month, Google posted a job listing for a "Central Reorg Support Team Partner." The responsibilities of that fixed-term contract position would include consulting with local HR teams and noted the need for the support staff's "ability to operate with empathy and diffuse/de-escalate challenging conversations/situations." "Hire the smartest people so they can tell us what to do," one employee wrote on the internal forum in meme-style font atop the images of Brin and Page. "Hire a reorg consultant so they can tell us how to layoff the smartest people," another said. Google ultimately took the job listing down. Touting its AI technology to clients, Pichai's leadership team has been aggressively pursuing federal government contracts, which has caused a heightened strain in some areas within the outspoken workforce since the beginning of the year. Google terminated more than 50 employees after a series of protests against Project Nimbus, a $1.2 billion joint contract with Amazon that provides the Israeli government and military with cloud computing and AI services. Executives repeatedly said the contract didn't violate any of the company's "AI principles." However, documents and reports show the company's agreement allowed for giving Israel AI tools that included image categorization, object tracking, as well as provisions for state-owned weapons manufacturers. Earlier this month, a New York Times report found that four months prior to signing on to Nimbus, officials at the company worried that signing the deal would harm its reputation and that "Google Cloud services could be used for, or linked to, the facilitation of human rights violations." In an all-hands meeting in April, a highly rated question asked why employees who did not participate in the protests were also fired, which was reported and cited in a National Labor Relations Board complaint from affected employees. Chris Rackow, Google's security chief, took the stage at the all-hands and rebutted those claims. "This was a very clear case of employees disrupting and occupying work spaces, and making other employees feel unsafe," a Google spokesperson told CNBC, adding that the company "carefully confirmed" that every person terminated was involved in the protests. "By any standard, their behavior was completely unacceptable." That round of job eliminations underscored Google's clampdown on internal discussions related to hot-button topics, including politics and geopolitical conflicts, which was encouraged by executives several years prior. One internal meme that got more than 2,000 likes, compared Google to Star Wars' Anakin Skywalker. The meme shows an image of a smiling childhood Skywalker, framed by one of the company's original, colorful employee badges. The meme progresses Skywalker's age in two later versions of the badge. The final badge shows Darth Vader working for "Google," spelled out in the font of IBM's logo. WATCH: Google's fate hinges on this man: Demis Hassabis Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Drill, Baby, Drill 2.0: Why Trump’s Return Will Bring Blockbuster Years For Natural Gas
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2024/12/27/drill-baby-drill-20-why-trumps-return-will-bring-blockbuster-years-for-natural-gas/
Time Published: 2024-12-27T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
In October 2008, with the economy reeling from the onset of the Great Recession and oil prices having spiked to $147 per barrel ($211 in today’s money), Vice Presidential candidate Joe Biden was asked during a debate to contrast his party’s energy policy with that of the Republicans. Biden said that their “only answer is drill, drill, drill. Drill we must, but it will take 10 years for one drop of oil to come out of any of the wells that are going to be drilled.” His vice presidential opponent Sarah Palin pounced; “The chant is ‘drill, baby, drill.’ And that’s what we hear all across this country… because people are so hungry for those domestic sources of energy to be tapped into.” Biden and Obama won that election, though Biden woefully underestimated American ingenuity. During the Obama years drillers boosted natural gas production by 45% to 92 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), while oil output more than doubled to 9 million barrels per day (bpd). But the frackers were too successful, causing a global oil glut that drove prices down to $28/bbl in 2016 and bankrupted dozens of companies. The industry recovered during the first Trump term; with executives refocused on growing profits. Despite the industry’s antipathy for Joe Biden, U.S. oil output has climbed steadily during his presidency to a record 13 million bpd of oil and 125 bcfd of natural gas today. And again the world is in an oil glut. Prices are currently hovering around $70/bbl and OPEC is holding back nearly 5 million barrels per day of untapped production capacity against the world’s daily 103 million barrels of consumption. Meanwhile Chinese oil companies are predicting peak oil demand as widespread electric vehicle usage in the nation is replacing gasoline guzzlers. “The fundamental outlook is bearish,” writes oil analyst Michael Hsueh at Deutsche Bank. This is why the resurgence of Drill, Baby, Drill under the second Trump term will focus not on oil, but rather natural gas. Biden has been a decidedly anti-gas president. The biggest affront: in 2022 he instituted a moratorium on new approvals of liquefied natural gas export projects. In recent years LNG exports from the U.S. have grown from nothing to 12 billion cubic feet per day, about 8% of total domestic supply. Despite the permit ban, projects already approved and under construction have continued apace, and are set to more than double U.S. exports. According to Neil Beveridge, analyst with Bernstein Research, “The expected glut of LNG is still coming, but it has been delayed, with maximum supply now expected in 2026 or 2027” – just in time for Trump (who is widely expected to reverse Biden’s ban) to take credit. A large portion of U.S. LNG heads to Europe to replace sales of Russian pipeline gas halted by the war on Ukraine, and to Asia, where it lessens reliance on the burning of far dirtier and carbon-intensive coal for electricity. Supplying LNG to the world is only half of the Drill, Baby, Drill equation. New demand for electricity in the United States is set to surge during the Trump years, particularly because of the rise in artificial intelligence. McKinsey, the consultancy, figures that the electricity needed to power A.I. data centers will grow from 25,000 megawatts today to 83,000 mw by 2030. This could cost upwards of $300 billion of capital investment in power plants, buildings, transmission lines and server farms. Data centers power demand would grow to some 12% of all U.S. electricity, up from 5% now. Drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania. Observing this coming need for power, Amazon, Google, Meta, OpenAI and others have invested billions into everything from solar and wind to advanced nuclear and geothermal. Investors in new publicly traded nuclear startup Oklo include Chris Wright, Trump’s incoming Secretary of Energy and Sam Altman of OpenAI. Oklo says it will work with developer Switch to roll out 12,000 megawatts of new nuclear by 2044. That’s a lot, but won’t come soon enough. Until advanced nuclear is a real thing, gas has proven it is the only scalable bridge fuel capable of displacing coal. Over the past 20 years U.S. has reduced coal consumption 63% from peak down to 400 million tons per year, while natural gas use is up by more than half to 33 trillion cubic feet per year. As a direct result, U.S. carbon dioxide emissions are down 15% over this period, the most of any developed nation. (China, by the way, continues to use record amounts of coal, 5 billion tons last year.) So the tech giants are turning to gas. One example: Meta recently announced plans to build a datacenter and 2,200 megawatt gas-fired plant in West Richland Parish, Louisiana, at a cost of $10 billion. Meta’s gas supplier is likely to be Occidental Petroleum, whose shares are down 20% this year to $48. Oxy is one of Berkshire Hathaway’s top holdings. Over the the summer it added several million more shares in the petroleum company at a price of nearly $60 per share. Investment analyst Chris Dowd at Third Avenue Management sees good times ahead for a cadre of other gas-focused exploration and production companies. These days he says his team is “licking its chops” on a micro-cap called SandRidge Energy. The Oklahoma City-based SandRidge (market cap: $406 million) emerged from bankruptcy a couple years ago and carries virtually no debt against a portfolio of some 450,000 acres of gas fields in the Mid-Continent area of Oklahoma and environs. Dowd loves that SandRidge has been keeping some of its wells “shut in” – holding on to gas in the ground rather than sell it at what has been historically low prices over the past year. Dowd says SandRidge has the potential to boost output 20% in short order to respond to LNG and A.I. demand. The company also has $1.6 billion of past operating losses to shield future earnings from federal income taxes. Biden’s permitorium “gummed up the inventory” of new wells needing to be drilled and fracked, says Dowd. “Once we get that flowing and don’t have the start-stop, we will have the machine really humming.” Coterra Energy is “another one that is a coiled spring,” says Dowd. “If we have ‘drill, baby, drill’ they can really lean in to adding production.” Coterra ($18 billion market cap) has been aggressive in buying back stock, but has a richer P/E of 15. Dowd prefers SandRidge. Trump is likely to allow the leasing of more federal lands for gas drilling. Biden’s Dept of Interior in 2023 leased only 161,000 acres of federal land, versus an average of 1.2 million acres a year during the Obama and Trump years. The reason is the Bureau of Land Management’s new “conservation and landscape health rule,” which places ecosystem health concerns (i.e. the threatened greater sage grouse and dunes sage lizard) on equal footing with the economic benefits of resource extraction. Of somewhat greater concern to the oil lobby is the Biden EPA’s newly finalized rules governing “fugitive emissions” of natural gas from fields and pipelines. Operators will have to pay $900 per ton of emissions, rising to $1,500 per ton in a few years. And they have to pay to install equipment to monitor those emissions and verify them using third parties. Many gas producers would welcome Trump efforts to soften or scrap the methane rules, which could cost billions of dollars a year in fines for the nation’s biggest emitters. One of those, Houston-based Hilcorp Energy, owned by billionaire Jeffery Hildebrand, recently agreed to a consent decree and $9 million civil penalty with the EPA over natural gas emissions from its San Juan Basin fields in the Four Corners region. Hilcorp teamed with Carlyle Group in 2017 to buy the decades-old San Juan assets for $3 billion. The field emits a lot because it consists of 12,000 gas wells across 2 million acres and hundreds of miles of gas collecting pipelines. Hilcorp promised to cut 113,000 tons of emissions there over 3 years – like taking 24,000 cars off the road. Some gas producers aren’t too concerned by such restrictions, because they have already been working not just to limit leaks, but to capture and permanently sequester carbon emissions. Chris Kalnin, CEO of BKV Energy, which raised $200 million in a 2024 IPO explains that his company has been injecting carbon dioxide underground at its shale fracking operations in north Texas. The work is monitored by gas detectors and third-party certified by American Carbon Registry, which mints non-fungible tokens representing the amounts of carbon sequestered by BKV and published them to the blockchain. This way BKV can sell its customers “decarbonized” gas, at a roughly $5 per thousand cubic feet premium. Alternatively, BKV can turn that gas into lower-carbon electricity at the 1,500 megawatt gas-fired power plant that BKV acquired in Temple, Texas. “We see multiple ways to win, aligned with megatrends,” says Kalnin. “The greens are on one side and drill, baby, drill is on the other side, and the silent majority is stuck in between,” says Kalnin. BKV (market cap $1.9 billion, $250 million ebitda) initially built up a gas position in the Marcellus shale of Pennsylvania, then in recent years Kalnin took the unusual tack of buying up assets in the birthplace of shale gas fracking – the Barnett shale field outside Fort Worth, Texas, where wildcatting legend George Mitchell proved out the combo of directional drilling and hydraulic fracturing. In 2020 BKV bought Devon Energy’s fields there for $500 million. And in 2022 it acquired ExxonMobil’s Barnett for $750 million. Kalnin says Exxon hadn’t made any meaningful investments there for years. “The Barnett is alive and well,” he says. And there’s plenty of shale gas left to frack all across the country. “They left huge meat on the bone.”

Title: From Apple’s record valuation to Zara’s share surge: An A-Z of financial markets in 2024

It was the year that the drawn-out Apple tax case finally came to a conclusion as the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) confirmed that the European Commission had been correct in deciding back in 2016 that the iPhone maker had received illegal state aid from Ireland and must pay the State €13 billion in back taxes, plus interest. Outgoing EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who persisted with the case, would tell reporters hours after the final ruling that she had broken down in tears when she learned the outcome. The €14 billion pot, including interest, held in escrow since 2018, took centre stage in the recent general election, featuring in all party manifestos as they pledged to spend the windfall on everything from housing to the green transition. The case had no bearing on Apple’s own share price, however, as it spiralled to new heights, making it the first business to beach the $3.5 trillion (€3.3 trillion) level. Bulmers ciders’ parent C&C was rattled in June when the drinks group restated three years of its earnings due to accounting errors, resulting in the company taking an underlying charge of €5 million and parting way with its chief executive of just over a year. C&C subsequently said that it will pay a €1.3 million settlement to the former CEO, Patrick McMahon. He had succeeded David Forde, who quit in May 2023 after the group incurred a one-off charge of €25 million related to the delayed implementation of a new business management system at one of its UK units. Corre Energy, the second-last company to float on the Irish stock market, in 2021, plunged 95 per cent this year as the storage developer for renewable energy required two emergency cash injections from large shareholders as it searched for a long-term investor and saw members of its original board, including its founders, depart. The Irish-run but Dutch-based company said in October that it was now prioritising capital expenditure on two projects in Germany, with the first of these on track for a final investment decision in 2026, after its previously most advanced project in the Netherlands encountered permit challenges. DCC, the Dublin-based but London-listed distribution and services conglomerate founded in 1976 by businessman Jim Flavin, moved to abandon its conglomerate roots in November as it set out on a path to sell its healthcare and technology units to focus on its fast-growing energy division. It follows the disposals over the past decade of DCC’s food and beverage assets, including the Robert Roberts tea and coffee and Kelkin health foods brand, the frozen and chilled foods logistics business, and recycling and waste management arm. Analysts estimate the healthcare and technology units could fetch a total of more than £3 billion (€3.63 billion), with the cash generated set to be returned to investors, most likely by way of share buy-backs. CEO Donal Murphy is hoping the narrowing of DCC’s focus will turn investors’ attention to how its energy division, which still earns most of its money selling fossil fuels to households, is increasingly targeting the green energy transition. The European Central Bank (ECB) and other big central banks remained centre stage during 2024 as they began to reduce interest rates following a series of hikes in recent years in a war against inflation. The ECB cut its key deposit rate a total of one percentage point spread across four quarter-point reductions since June. The rate-setting body for the euro zone expects inflation across the region to be back at its 2 per cent target next year, down from a peak of 10.6 per cent in October 2023. Wall Street in New York lured more Iseq heavyweights this year, with Flutter Entertainment, parent of Paddy Power and Betfair, delisting from Euronext Dublin, the Irish Stock Exchange operator, in January. It was followed in July by Smurfit Kappa, which moved its main quotation to the US on completion of its merger with cardboard box-making rival Westrock to form Smurfit Westrock. CRH had quit the Irish market in late 2023. Greencore more than doubled in value in 2024 following a tumultuous eight years, as its CEO of two years, Dalton Philips, steered a recovery for the maker of sandwiches to ready-made Italian meals for big supermarkets. In the process, Philips backed out of low-yielding contracts and leaned into trends such as the “joy of missing out” to push dine-in meal kits to those happy to forgo going out. Greencore’s earnings for the year to September topped the company’s own guidance, even after it had raised its forecasts three times during the period. Philips also signalled that the group is preparing to get back out on the acquisitions trail for the first time in years. Harland & Wolff, the Belfast-based shipbuilder that produced the Titanic, collapsed into administration in September, with insolvency practitioners at Teneo assigned to oversee the process, after it failed to find new funding to stay afloat. The company’s AIM-listed shares in London were suspended in August and ultimately delisted in October. The administrators entered exclusive talks the same month to sell the business to Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navartia. A deal was agreed before Christmas. Ires Reit, the Republic’s largest private residential landlord, reached a truce with activist investor Vision Capital in April by offering two board seats to nominees of the Canadian firm as the group continued a strategic review into its options as the share price remained under pressure. Ires hired property industry veteran Eddie Byrne as its CEO that same month, succeeding Margaret Sweeney. The board concluded in August that a substantive sale of the group or its assets – which Vision had been seeking – was not in Ires’s best interests, though it committed to a “capital recycling programme”, selling off noncore apartment assets to unlock some value for investors. The outcome has yet to excite stock market investors. Ires’s shares fell over 17 per cent this year. Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) shares were in the doldrums this year as the US pharma and medtech giant continued to add to a settlement offer aimed at ending thousands of ovarian cancer lawsuits linked to its talcum powder. J&J moved in September to wrap the $9 billion (€8.54 billion) settlement in a pre-packaged chapter 11 bankruptcy of a unit, called Red River Talc, in Texas. A federal judge will decide on the validity of this route – which would end almost all cases – early next year. Kingspan was in focus in September as a long-awaited final UK report on the Grenfell tower disaster in London. The company’s Kooltherm K15 insulation board had been used for 5 per cent of the insulation behind the building’s cladding. The Cavan-based group didn’t know that its product had been used in the development and the report found that insulation was not the main cause of the fire that claimed the lives of 72 people. However, the chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was scathing of the group for falsely claiming that a form of K15 had successfully passed fire tests that allowed it to be used on the external walls of high-rise buildings in the first place. It “knowingly created a false market” for the insulation, he said. Luxury goods groups from LVMH Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy and Kehring, owner of brands including Gucci, Alexander McQueen and Balenciaga, to Swatch, whose watch brands span Omega to Longines, saw their shares slide this year amid uncertainty around demand out of the key Chinse and Japanese markets. Management consulting firm Bain & Company estimates that global sales of personal luxury goods will fall 2 per cent this year, with economic uncertainty shrinking the industry’s customer base. It reckons China, which had seen a sustained boom for years amid a growing middle class, is on track for a 22 per cent sales slump in 2024. CRH selected chief financial officer Jim Mintern to succeed Albert Manifold, who had pursued record levels of deal-making over the past 11 years to move the traditional seller of cement and other base materials into full-scale construction services, as of the end of 2024. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€12.5 million) last year and CRH said in its latest annual report that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align” with practices in the US, where it moved its main stock market listing last year. Nvidia, the undisputed darling of Wall Street as the global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) computing, saw its shares soar over 190 per cent over the course of 2024 – pushing its market value to $3.43 trillion (€3.3 trillion) – as it continued to deliver blowout earnings. Its stock rose at a multiple of the pace of the other members of the so-called magnificent seven, which also include Facebook’s parent, Meta, Tesla, Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet, Apple and Amazon. Japanese camera giant Olympus was in focus for all the wrong reasons in October when its German CEO, Stefan Kaufmann, was booted out amid allegations of the purchase of illegal drugs. Kaufman, who had joined a European unit of Olympus 21 years ago, was subsequently indicted by prosecutors, suspected of having taken possession of cocaine and the synthetic drug MDMA multiple times in Tokyo in 2023. Irish financier Paul Coulson’s Ardagh saw its riskiest bonds trade at below 20 cent on the euro during 2024 as investors became increasingly concerned about the glass and metal containers group’s $12.4 billion (€11.7 billion) debt pile – especially as the outlook for its glass bottles unit continued to weaken. The multinational glass and metal containers manufacturer for the drinks industry, built up by Coulson over the past 25 years, continues to weigh how to reduce its borrowings. The price at which its most-junior – or subordinated – bonds have been trading indicates that holders of these notes expect they will have to write off much of what they are owed as part of restructuring. Coulson owns about 36 per cent of the business, which traces its roots back to the now long-defunct Irish Glass Bottle Company. CEO quitting and firings hit record levels globally in 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the international firm that assists “transitioning” executives find new roles. Big CEO exits include Laxman Narasimhan from Starbucks, who was ousted by his board in August after 17 months, Mark Schneider at Nestlé, Dennis Muilenburg at Boeing, Pat Gelsinger at Intel and Carlos Tavares at Stellantis, the car-making group whose brands include Peugeot, Fiat and Jeep. Reddit, the Californian social media company, made its long-anticipated stock market flotation on the Nasdaq in March in a deal that valued the business at $8.87 billion (€8.4 billion). The 19-year old company, popular for its member-led communities known as subreddits that span interest areas from world news to brain-rot memes, has seen its share price soar about 250 per cent since, helped by the posting its first-ever profit in the third quarter of this year, as a new artificial intelligence (AI) feature that translates English posts into French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German drove user numbers higher. Sterling became the surprise best-performing currency among those by G10 (group of 10 industrialised nations), following years of volatility that has seen it dubbed the British lira among other names, according to the Wall Street Journal. The pound rose as much as 5.2 per cent against the euro alone, as the Labour Party’s election victory in June lifted a lot of political uncertainty and the Bank of England trailed other big central banks in cutting interest rates. Still, that was nothing on the performance of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, which soared as much as 150 per cent – turbocharged in November by Donald Trump’s re-election as US president. The Republican has vowed to make the US the “crypto capital” of the world. Elon Musk’s Tesla soared 29 per cent in the week of the Trump victory, pushing it above the $1 trillion (€950 billion) valuation mark amid hopes the president-elect’s highest-profile promoter on the campaign trail (who contributed more than $130 million to the cause) will see his companies get favourable treatment from the incoming administration. Still, China’s BYD overtook Tesla late last year as the world’s top seller of electric vehicles with its more affordable range. It also sped past Tesla in terms of overall revenues in the third quarter for the first time, helped by hybrid sales as well as battery-powered vehicles. Italy’s second-largest bank, Unicredit, ruffled political and labour union feathers in Germany in September when it swooped in to snap up a 21 per cent stake in Frankfurt-based Commerzbank with a view to launching a takeover bid. While chancellor Olaf Scholz has been a big proponent of an EU banking union, he denounced the Italian manoeuvre as “an unfriendly attack”. Unicredit has since launched a €10 billion bid for domestic rival Banco BPM – and its CEO, Andrea Orcel, has indicated he is unlikely to make a move on Commerzbank at least until German elections are done and dusted in February following the unrelated collapse of Scholz’s government. Still, he has since upped the Commerzbank stake to 28 per cent. Irish banker David Duffy led Virgin Money to a £2.9 billion (€3.5 billion) sale to fellow UK lender Nationwide Building Society at the end of September to create the second-largest mortgages and savings business in that market. The former AIB chief executive quit the Irish bank in 2015 for Clydesdale and Yorkshire Bank Group (CYBG), then a subsidiary of National Australia Bank. He led CYBG through an IPO in early 2016 and into a merger two years later with Virgin Money. Duffy stepped down as Virgin’s CEO as the Nationwide tie-up was completed and is estimated to have secured a pay-day worth as much as £15.3 million (€18.3 million) through the sale of shares and stock options he held in the bank. Walt Disney defeated a challenge to its board in April from activist investor and Brooklyn Beckham’s father-in-law, Nelson Peltz, handing a victory to CEO Bob Iger and ending one of the most expensive boardroom battles in history. The stock has rallied strongly in the past few months after the company reported better-than-expected results for its financial year to September, boosted by its streaming business and issued a rosier outlook than followers of the company had been used to in recent times. French telecoms billionaire Xavier Niel set out on a path towards full ownership of Eir, as two US hedge funds began to exit their investment in the former Irish telecoms monopoly, in which debt market investors hold €1.35 billion of bonds. Firms belonging to Niel acquired 64.5 per cent of Eir in April 2018 in a deal that saw two of the company’s largest pre-existing investors, hedge funds run by New York firms Anchorage Capital and Davidson Kempner, roll most of their shares into a combined 35.5 per cent interest. It is understood that Davidson Kempner sold its 8.9 per cent holding in the business over the summer to Anchorage Capital. Anchorage began to gradually sell down the combined stake by participating in a share buyback by a holding company above Eir in October. Neil’s stake currently stands at about 69 per cent. The market interest rate – or yield – on French 10-year government debt rose above those of crisis-scarred Greece for the first time in late November as Michel Barnier’s government limped towards collapse after he controversially used special powers to force through his budget without a vote. Marine Le Pen’s far-right grouping and the left-wing New Popular Front united in early December to force through a no-confidence motion in the former Brexit negotiator’s government. Greece, which emerged from a third international bailout in 2018, saw its creditworthiness upgraded to investment grade in late 2023 by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings, following 13 years of junk status. Its economy has grown faster than the EU average over the past five years, its government is rapidly reprivatising banks that were rescued during the crisis and it is repaying chunks of its bailout loans ahead of schedule. Zara owner, Inditex’s shares soared as much as 45 per cent in 2024, twice the pace of the wider European retail sector as its popular fashion ranges and nimble operations helped it cope better than some of its rivals with changing consumer demands. The group, which also owns the Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear brands, has been quicker to adapt to fashion trends and potential headwinds than some of its rivals, thanks to its tightly managed supply chain, according to analysts. Investors are also keeping a close eye on Inditex’s ambitious expansion plans in the US, its second-largest market by sales, where it opened its first Zara store in 1989 and where its Massimo Dutti brand has made a tentative return recently after a previous foray into market failed. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: From Aer Lingus pilots to Alias Tom: Who were the winners and losers in Irish business this year?

Mopping up the messy entrails of 2024 isn’t a straightforward job. What kind of year was that anyway? For much of the business world, it felt like a wait-and-see period – a damp purgatory for some, a cushioned holding pattern of a year for others. Plenty enjoyed a 2024 that was somewhere between reasonable and decent, if not the definitive bounce-back they had hoped for in January. Some started the year in positions of strength and went on to manifest more success than ever. Some, channelling corporation tax receipts, were worryingly buoyant. But within industries wracked by inflation, cost-of-living pressures and/or retreating rates of investment, “survive ‘til 25″ became the quiet catchphrase. Some ran out of money, then ran out of time. Some just wilted. Others swam in a sea of setbacks, gasping through another quarter, another season. Dispiritingly, those for whom the year could have been better included much of the hospitality industry. More than 600 restaurants, cafes and food businesses closed, according to the Restaurants Association of Ireland industry lobby group, as swollen costs and the legacy of pandemic debt overwhelmed them. In August, there was shock among restaurateurs as celebrated chef Dylan McGrath shut down two restaurants, Brasserie Sixty6 and Rustic Stone, warning that hospitality in Dublin was “simply not sustainable”. Other big names joined in the retrenchment: October saw Shanahan’s on the Green close for the foreseeable, while Dillinger’s in Ranelagh said goodbye to customers after a 15-year “wild ride”. For Press Up, the fast scaled-up group founded by schoolfriends Paddy McKillen jnr (son of the property developer) and Matt Ryan, there was something even more unpalatable on the menu: a reckoning. In September, London-based lender Cheyne Capital took control of the group in a debt-for-equity swap that aims to solidify its financials. One Wowburger and three Wagamama restaurants in Dublin were shuttered and though it later opened Asian restaurant Kaldero in the former Wagamamas outlet on South King Street, it was still a glum autumn for a group that had previously seemed immune from the woes of the sector. Not far away, a retailer at the heart of Dublin since the 1970s was counting the cost of changed fashions: Alias Tom, which in its time had clothed U2, Westlife and the business and political elite, went into liquidation, citing “the move toward less formal workwear”. Founded in 1976 by Tom Kennedy, Alias Tom once had exclusivity on brands such as Prada, Hugo Boss and Gucci. But in 2024, the “only realistic option” left for the company – 10 per cent of which was still owned by Kennedy – was to wind up. Dublin stockbrokers were part of the Alias Tom clientele at one point, but Dublin stockbrokers are now themselves a lesser spotted breed. As for the Irish Stock Exchange, which has traded as Euronext Dublin since 2018, this wasn’t a vintage year. In July, packaging group Smurfit Kappa, as it was then known, completed a hat-trick of heavyweight exits that started in 2023 with CRH and continued in January with Flutter Entertainment. Mention of the 231-year-old exchange in the budget speech of the somewhat younger Minister for Finance, Jack Chambers, reflected the extent to which a halving of companies on the Iseq All-Share index since 2018 was perceived to have become an Ireland Inc problem, not merely a Euronext one. It hasn’t helped that HealthBeacon and Corre Energy, two of the only three companies to take initial public offerings (IPOs) in Dublin over the past five years, have not had a tremendous time of it. By January, cash-burning medical technology company HealthBeacon had progressed from “embattled” status to officially in need of rescue. One arrived courtesy of US-based kitchen appliance maker Hamilton Beach Brands, but the company consequentially delisted. Corre Energy, for its part, spent most of 2024 watching its share price plunge. There was little else to do. The company develops underground storage facilities for renewable energy, but permit challenges have pushed back a crucial final investment decision on its key Zuidwending (ZW1) compressed air energy storage project in the Netherlands until after 2027. Back in February, co-founder Darren Patrick-Green exited his president and executive director roles after an unrelated business he owned was linked by UK revenue officials to a tax avoidance scheme. In November, with Corre still desperately seeking a strategic investor, chief executive Keith McGrane stepped down. A search for new executive energy began. The relief at the start of the year was that there appeared to be no sequel to “tech winter”, the job-shedding phenomenon of 2022-23 that had seen just about every technology company in town announce at least one round of redundancies. But 2024 ended on a bum note for the indigenous sector after the Government opted not to extend the National Digital Research Centre (NDRC) accelerator programme – which trains, mentors and invests in start-ups – beyond its November 2025 end date. It was open-letter time. [ The Irish Times view on the National Digital Research Centre: ending State funding is short-sightedOpens in new window ] More than 200 tech founders warned that if the Government didn’t reverse the decision, which they blasted as “disconnected from reality”, it would stymie future innovation and economic resilience. Alas, a general election had already been called by this point and no one was paying much attention. Michael O’Leary, an early election headline-maker, more often than not appears in the winners’ section of this annual review. The longest-serving chief executive of any large airline doesn’t really have bad years, not relative to everyone else. The short-haul king doesn’t even have to crack a joke for a roomful of Fine Gael supporters to collapse with laughter because they think he has. Alas, one of the key tasks to befall him in 2024 was to wait for multi-troubled Boeing to pony up the planes it owes his airline, and for that reason alone it can’t have been a hilarious year. The new executives in charge of the US manufacturer “continue to disappoint”, O’Leary was heard lamenting in summer. By October, he seemed resigned to the likelihood of having to “walk back our traffic growth” as a result of delivery delays he summed up in characteristic style as a “pain in the backside”. To the election, then. Losing slowly in count centres is a common fate, but presumably no less deflating for that. Caught up in a comprehensive greenlash, Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media Catherine Martin was second only to Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly on the high-profile casualties list. Martin, who will be missed by an arts community she supported better than most, came under Oireachtas committee-grilling pressure in the spring after she appeared to stir up tensions from nowhere with then RTÉ chairwoman Siún Ní Raghallaigh over the precise nature of the information conveyed to her about the procedures followed when RTÉ reached an exit agreement with former RTÉ finance chief Richard Collins. RTÉ hadn’t done anything wrong this time, but the organisation-reforming Ní Raghallaigh, baffled by the Minister’s arcane complaint, felt forced to resign, and later echoed Martin’s critics in the Opposition by accusing her of “taking a hands-off approach” to its various crises. It seemed there was also nothing any Minister could do, meanwhile, about airport operator DAA’s strange obligation – thanks to a 32 million passenger cap mandated by planning laws – to actually suppress passenger numbers at Dublin Airport. In August, the airport had the busiest month in its history. A good return on investment for the public money that is annually poured into promoting Ireland to potential overseas visitors? DAA chief executive Kenny Jacobs, frustrated by the uncertainty and branding the cap “not the best look for Ireland”, was not the only one wishing it was that simple. As the year neared its close, one Irish export was confirmed as a toxic brand. Conor McGregor’s earning power unravelled at pace after a High Court jury upheld Nikita Hand’s civil claim that she was raped by the mixed martial arts fighter in a Dublin hotel. IO Interactive, the Danish owner of the Hitman gaming franchise, was the first to “cease its collaboration”. Then, one by one, every retailer that had previously been keen to sell McGregor’s Forged Irish Stout and Proper No. Twelve Whiskey destocked them. Proximo Spirits – the company to which McGregor sold his whiskey in 2021 – valiantly announced it would stop using his name and likeness in its marketing in a bid to save its acquisition. But with even the paraffin wax version of McGregor at the National Wax Museum taken out of circulation, the taint by association was unmistakable. Let’s swiftly segue now to some bona fide winners via the spectre of Donald Trump, a man who showed us all in 2024 that being a judge-confirmed rapist is no barrier to becoming US president. Trump’s election victory threatens to make losers of vast tracts of the planet, if not the planet itself – a cheery thought to dwell on when Jools Holland’s Rhythm & Blues Orchestra breaks into its traditional Hootenanny rendition of Enjoy Yourself (It’s Later Than You Think). But if the world ends in 2025, at least some people can say they went out on a high. Those highs were literal for Aer Lingus pilots. By late July, they were back in the air after a two-week work-to-rule period plus an eight-hour strike. Holding firm in the face of “management intransigence” meant they pocketed a 17.75 per cent pay increase – following a Labour Court recommendation – rather than the 12.25 per cent originally offered. They also won a boost to their allowances and swerved the rostering concessions sought by the IAG-owned airline. Along the way, the travel plans of 90,000 passengers were disrupted while, as the dispute hit the headlines, social media users were quick to spy a certain resemblance between Capt Mark Tighe, president of the Irish Air Line Pilots’ Association, and one Captain Birdseye. He won’t have cared. For the pilots, the outcome was, he said, “the greatest pay award seen in 30 years”. After seeing his stock plummet within international tech circles in 2023, Web Summit founder Paddy Cosgrave ascended once again this year to cruising altitude. He was back as chief executive of the events group, having served a six-month hiatus to placate the tech luminaries who found his stance on Israel – that “war crimes are war crimes even when committed by allies” – controversial. Some of them, including Meta and IBM, returned to sponsor this year’s event in Lisbon at which a more muted Cosgrave avoided any further turbulence. A memorable main character of another kind was at the centre of the film Poor Things, in which Emma Stone played an adult woman implanted with a baby’s brain, bringing home four Oscars and a box office take of $117 million (€110 million). [ Poor Things review: Emma Stone is properly unsettling in this provocative feminist fable drenched in Victorian horrorOpens in new window ] This was heartening for fans of unsettling, offbeat fantasy cinema. But it was even more rewarding for Element Pictures, the prolific Dublin production company led by Ed Guiney and Andrew Lowe, with the total of 11 Oscar nominations garnered by Poor Things setting a new record for the most ever secured by an Irish-produced film. Another home-grown company generating joy was Smyth’s Toys. Accounts filed later in 2024 showed the retailer’s combined pretax profits across the regions in which it operates hit €54.6 million in 2023. That’s a lot of Lego. Indeed, with its businesses in the Republic and Northern Ireland now representing just 14 per cent of its total revenues, the Mayo brothers behind Smyth’s Toys have made expansion across Europe look like child’s play. Also doing well overseas was Co Tyrone’s Sarah Friar, the former chief executive of neighbourhood social networking service Nextdoor, who in June joined artificial intelligence hype-lodestone OpenAI as its chief financial officer, working alongside Sam “superintelligence” Altman. Another appointment of note came in December when Trump nominated Dublin-born Gail Slater as assistant attorney general at the US department of justice’s antitrust division. “Together, we will Make America Competitive Again!” the president-elect posted on Truth Social. Making America Healthy Again, genuinely, were the EY Entrepreneur(s) of the Year: Sharon Cunningham and Orlaith Ryan, the chief executive and chief technology officer respectively of Clonmel-headquartered Shorla Oncology. Their company, which raised $45 million this year, counts four US Food and Drug Administration-approved products within a growing portfolio of accessible, life-saving treatments for patients with rare, orphan and paediatric cancers. At the ceremony, Ryan described the award as “validation” for the Shorla team’s years of hard work. But whatever happened to those erstwhile Iseq stalwarts after they upped sticks from the Dublin stock market? It was onwards and upwards for Tony Smurfit as he moved seamlessly from his role as boss of cardboard box-making giant Smurfit Kappa to the new position of group chief executive of packaging mega-giant Smurfit Westrock. This followed July’s formal seal on the Irish company’s deal to merge with US peer WestRock. Smurfit Westrock, which has its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange, reported a net loss for its first quarter as a merged group, booking $500 million (€461 million) of expenses and accounting adjustments related to the transaction. But its earnings otherwise pointed to “a strong foundation to build upon”, said a confident Smurfit. True, not every athlete at Paris 2024 was a huge fan of the sustainable cardboard beds the company supplied to the Olympic Village. The good news, however, is that these have now been recycled into “the equivalent of 1.5 million wine boxes”. Cheers! Cement-maker CRH, for a long time the largest stock on the Iseq, found itself enjoying New York life. In the 12 months after it relocated its main listing to Wall Street, its share price swelled 60 per cent. By autumn, it seemed not even bad weather could leave much of an imprint on its performance. It will be all change for the company in 2025, with acquisition-loving chief executive Albert Manifold set to be succeeded in the top job by his finance chief, Jim Mintern. Manifold earned $13.2 million (€11.9 million) last year, hanging on to his title as the highest paid boss of an Irish plc, but Mintern could be in line for an even bigger bonanza, with the company indicating that its “compensation structures will evolve to more closely align with US practices”. Insert dollar signs here. Will gambling company Flutter Entertainment have a ka-ching of a 2025? You wouldn’t bet against it. The owner of Paddy Power and Betfair, led by chief executive Peter Jackson, recently snapped up Italy’s Snaitech and a 56 per cent stake in Brazil’s Betnacional operator NSX Group – deals that give Flutter top three positions in most of the world’s regulated gambling markets. National Football League (NFL) results didn’t quite go the way of its US brand FanDuel in October, but you can’t win them all – not in the short term. Over the medium term, as more US states legalise sports betting, FanDuel and Flutter remain poised to cash in. There were comebacks of sorts this year for two Irishmen who both resigned from their previous roles after different forms of misconduct. Declan Kelly – who quit his global public relations firm Teneo in 2021 after accusations of drunken misbehaviour at a charity concert – spent 2024 signing up sports stars and business names for his new-ish advisory vehicle Consello, which expanded its operations into Ireland. As for former BP chief executive Bernard Looney, he was “wishing BP well”, he said, as joined the board of US data centre company Prometheus Hyperscale a year after he was obliged to resign from the oil giant for failing to disclose past relationships with colleagues. Having spent 32 years at BP, Looney (54) told the Financial Times he was “thinking about the next 32 years” of his career. Same, Bernard, same. It may take almost that long to assess the full ramifications of the creeping change and dramatic power swings we witnessed and endured in 2024. But for now, with the tendrils of Christmas already starting to unwrap, the only thing left to do is to wish everyone who deserves them many sustainably profitable returns in 2025 – and everyone who doesn’t, none. © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Slower AI spending could ignite a 'vicious' downturn for chipmakers, Nvidia supplier says

Semiconductor companies will suffer if Big Tech's spending on data centers slows, the head of the largest provider of chip-testing equipment told the Financial Times. Artificial intelligence-linked smartphones could save the day, he added. According to Advantest CEO Doug Lefever, the downswing wouldn't have to last long to have a pronounced effect on the industry. Given the concentration of hyperscalers in the space, he said, "any slowdown in the data center buildout is going to have big reverberations in the supply chain." Firms such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure, generating both excitement and apprehension on Wall Street. By the end of the year, hyperscalers will have spent an estimated $222 billion on AI chips and data centers to run the emerging technology. Although AI spending is projected to keep surging, some industry watchers have grown anxious about whether the spending spree can last — especially if AI doesn't live up to the hype. Even Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has warned about overspending on AI, which he described earlier this month as a "race to the bottom. " He added, "While there is a big movement of a lot of companies into these kind of public clouds, I think that we have to be careful exactly how much we're investing." Overspending fears briefly dented the performance of key semiconductor companies in September. Lefever has good reason to pay close attention to the space: Enthusiasm for AI has made semiconductors increasingly complex, boosting demand for Advantest's equipment. ADRs on the Tokyo-based stock are up 71.32% this year as a result. "I don't like to use the word bubble because it implies that it's going to go away, but there will be cycles," Lefever told FT. "When that next cycle comes . . . it could be pretty vicious." AI smartphones, however, could prove the industry's saving grace, Lefever said. "Everyone is holding their breath, waiting for the killer app with the AI handsets . . . if that happens and people start replacing their phones, it's going to be crazy," he told FT. Wall Street analysts are equally bullish over AI phones, a consideration already seeping into price targets. On Thursday, Wedbush Securities raised its target on Apple to $325, citing high expectations over Apple Intelligence — an AI software accessible on new iPhone products. "This will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases, and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace," analyst Dan Ives said.

Title: Nasdaq 100 Adjusts Weightings Amid Record Gains by Major Tech Firms

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Meta Platforms (META, Financials), Broadcom (AVGO, Financials), and Tesla (TSLA, Financials) all saw weightings within the Nasdaq 100 index shrink after notable stock price gains over the year. Bloomberg data shows that these changes aim to keep the index in balance. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with META. Among those earning higher weight were Apple (AAPL, Financials), Nvidia (NVDA, Financials), Microsoft (MSFT, Financials), and Alphabet (GOOG, Financials; GOOGL, Financials). The rebalancing follows a rule limiting the total weight of the top five components to around 40%. Projected at 515,000 units with year-over-year rise, Tesla is likely to set a new quarterly record for vehicle deliveries in the fourth quarter. Third week of December saw 17,600 weekly insurance registrations for Tesla; its weekly insurance registrations in China showed a 12% rise over previous quarter and a 13% year-on-year increase. Although it declined consecutively from last week, Tesla's quarterly performance in the Chinese market is probably going to be outstanding. A tire pressure monitoring system issue that might lead to an accident by not sufficiently notifying drivers of low tire pressures has caused Tesla to issue a recall for over 700,000 automobiles. Among the specific models from 2017 to 2025, the recall calls especially for the Model 3, Model Y, and the 2024 Cybertruck. Tesla will provide a free over-the-air software update to address the problem. Although some recent dips, Tesla's stock has seen noteworthy rise and now ranks among the $1 trillion market capital value. Shares for this month are up 35%; for this year they are 87%. Broadcom officially joined the $1 trillion club driven by a demand for its chips running artificial intelligence. Its AI-generated fiscal 2024 revenue doubled year-over-year to $12.2 billion, therefore fueling total sales of $51 billion more. Forecasts of a 40% rise in fiscal 2025 and rising market share inspire experts about Broadcom's potential AI income growth. Claiming violation of its patents on "virtual machines," Netflix has sued Broadcom's subsidiary VMware. This legal action feeds ongoing disputes between Netflix and Broadcom that include claims of Netflix breaching Broadcom's video streaming technology patents since 2018. Broadcom's stock has exploded over 100% as demand from artificial intelligence customers takes hold. AI revenue surged 280% to $3.1 billion only in the last quarter. Broadcom's acquisition of a significant quarter growth driver, a cloud computing software company, VMware has also drawn compliments from investors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks struggled to meaningfully extend a "Santa Claus" rally the day after Christmas while Wall Street digested one of the only significant economic data points of the week. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell below the flatline while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) fell slightly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed the session up 28 points after flipping between positive and negative territory throughout the light trading session. Small cap stocks inched higher, sending the Russell 2000 (^RUT) up 0.9%. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) fell to hover near the $96,000 level as volatile trading continued. Crypto-linked stocks like MicroStrategy (MSTR) tracked the declines. Markets kicked off the "Santa Claus" rally on Tuesday as the S&P 500 notched its best Christmas Eve performance since 1974, according to Bespoke. The broader index and Nasdaq Composite moved to within striking distance of their records after clawing back gains from a Fed-fueled dive last week. As Wall Street saunters back from its holiday break, the normally routine release of weekly jobless claims took more of a spotlight than usual as the only piece of the jobs puzzle on the docket this week. According to the latest Labor Department data, weekly jobless claims fell to 219,000 compared with expectations of 223,000. However continuing claims pointed to a cooling labor market, jumping by 46,000 in the week ending Dec. 14 to 1.91 million, the highest level since November 2021. Stocks closed mixed amid a light trading session on Thursday following the Christmas holiday break. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed just below the flat line. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose about 28 points, or nearly 0.1%. Stocks were little changed throughout the session, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory as the market struggled to meaningfully extend its Santa Claus rally. Small cap stocks however rose as the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gained more than 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up nearly 15% year-to-date, but Boeing (BA) and Nike (NKE) have been the big laggards of 2024. As Bespoke Investment Group pointed out, with the exception of Intel (which was booted off the blue-chip index in place of AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) in November), industrial giant Boeing is the biggest laggard, down 30% since the start of the year after a slew of production and safety challenges. Sports apparel com[any Nike is also down about 29% since the start of the year. Tesla (TSLA) extended declines to 2% on Thursday afternoon, making it difficult for the Nasdaq (^IXIC) and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to firmly trade in positive territory. Still, shares of the EV maker are up more than 80% year to-date. The majority of those stock gains were achieved following Donald Trump's presidential victory in November, which Tesla CEO Elon Musk was instrumental in supporting. Trading volume for Tesla stock on Thursday was about 30% less than average daily volume, according to Yahoo Finance chart data. Bitcoin was trading 3% lower on Thursday afternoon as prices hovered below the $96,000 level. The token is down about 10% from its all-time highs north of $108,000 reached over a week ago. Despite the recent dip, bitcoin is up nearly 120% year to date, far outperforming other asset classes like gold and the major stock market averages. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports, 2024 has been a year when everything changed for the cryptocurrency once viewed as a fringe sideshow, a concern for D.C. policymakers, and a subject of ridicule for top Wall Street figures. Crypto's widespread acceptance this year translated into major gains for investors who were along for the ride. Stocks wavered by 1 p.m. ET, with the major averages flipping between positive and negative territory. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hugged the flat line while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also little changed. Shares of EV giant Tesla (TSLA) and social media company Meta (META) both fell, weighing on the Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Meanwhile, chip stock Broadcom (AVGO) rose for a fourth straight day. GameStop (GME) stock rose as much as 10% early Thursday before paring gains. Shares were up roughly 6% midday. The stock's gain comes after infamous meme stock trader "Roaring Kitty" — whose real name is Keith Gill — posted a mysterious photo of a wrapped present on Dec. 25. GME's climb Thursday puts the stock on track to notch a roughly 16% gain over the past five days. The stock is up over 88% in 2024, fueled by Roaring Kitty's return to social media after three years of silence. Still, GameStop shares remain well below all-time highs of over $80 during the stock's short squeeze in 2021. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early session losses by 11:30 a.m. ET. Shares of Honeywell (HON) and Boeing (BA) rose more than 1%, helping lift the blue-chip index slightly above the flatline. Apple (AAPL) touched intraday highs after a price target raise to a Street high of $325 from Wedbush analysts Dan Ives. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) pared early morning losses to trade just below the flatline. Apple (AAPL) stock hit an all-time intraday high Thursday after a nod of confidence in its continued upswing from Wall Street. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives raised his price target on Apple shares to a new Street high of $325, anticipating “a golden era of growth” for the Tim Cook-helmed tech giant in 2025. Apple stock touched $260 early Thursday before modestly paring gains. The stock was still on track to notch another record close after hitting a high of $258.20 on Christmas Eve. Shares have rallied more than 11% over the past month, and the iPhone maker is nearing a $4 trillion market cap. Read the full story here. Shares of AI chip heavyweight (NVDA) fell more than 1% while the rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks wavered on Thursday. Technology stocks led the modest market declines as the "Santa Claus rally" from Wednesday took a pause after the Christmas holiday break. Shares of iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) flipped between positive and negative territory during morning trading. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: If 2024 was the year of AI chatbots becoming more useful, 2025 will be the year AI agents begin to take over. Autonomous and semi-autonomous AI systems, you can think of agents as super powered AI bots that can take actions on your behalf, such as pulling data from incoming emails and importing it into different apps. You’ve probably heard rumblings of agents already. Companies ranging from Nvidia (NVDA) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM) are increasingly talking up agentic AI, a fancy way of referring to AI agents, claiming that it will change the way both enterprises and consumers think of AI technologies. Read more here. Stocks opened lower on Thursday following a Christmas break, putting a pause on a Santa Claus rally. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was down 0.3% while the the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) declined 0.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.4%, leading the way down. All 11 sectors of the S&P 500 were lower, with Real Estate stocks leading to the downside.

Decrypt conducted analysis using data from CoinGecko and Nasdaq to identify top-performing coins. To qualify, assets needed a starting market cap of at least $500 million, observed from January 1 to December 17. Other digital asset-related investments, including those of major companies, also did quite well. Here's a look at this year's top-performing assets. One of the newer meme tokens to sit near the top of the market, Pepe (PEPE), launched last year. The token is based on Pepe the Frog, an internet cartoon later labeled a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League after alt-right groups strangely adopted it. Pepe hit a new all-time high in December. The Ethereum-based token started the year with a market cap of $590.8 million, but landed at $9.4 billion by December 17—a 1,492% surge. Pepe grabbed headlines for—in typical meme style—its absurd rise in value and how rich it made a small number of traders. But unlike many assets in the bizarre space of meme tokens, Pepe kept going up, and it’s now the 28th biggest coin by market cap. It wasn’t long ago that the little-known Sui (SUI) came on the scene: Launched in May 2023, the blockchain was developed by ex-Meta (formerly Facebook) engineers and now has a buzzing DeFi community using its speedy network. Rapid blockchain Sui’s native SUI token has boomed this year. In January, its market cap stood at $925 million. A 1,193% rise means that by December, it had hit nearly $12 billion. SUI is now the 18th biggest cryptocurrency by market cap. Michael Saylor’s software company went all in on Bitcoin this year—and the firm’s stock shows that it was trading for less than $70 a share at the start of the year. By December, it had increased nearly fivefold—touching $386. That’s a 464% increase and better than everything else on the Nasdaq, including Nvidia. MicroStrategy was formerly a quiet software company. It then started buying Bitcoin in 2020 and rebranded itself as a “Bitcoin treasury company.” This year, the Tyson, Virginia-based entity accelerated its orange coin buys, promising speculators the best deal for Bitcoin exposure. Investors—including hedge funds looking to get volatile returns—piled in on the stock. The O.G. meme coin. Created as a joke to poke fun at the silly amount of altcoins being minted into existence, Dogecoin (DOGE) is now the seventh largest crypto by market cap. Its market cap jumped by 342% this year and now stands at $45.9 billion. Bitcoin’s rise certainly helped. It’s mainly got Tesla CEO Elon Musk to thank for that: The world’s richest man posted frequently about the asset in 2020-2021, and did so again this year amid speculation that the coin would be used on his platform X (formerly Twitter). XRP has had a strong year. The token facilitates transactions on the Ripple network, which provides institutions with a blockchain solution for cross-border payments. The token’s market cap has shot up so much that it’s now the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, increasing 286% from $34 billion to $131.2 billion. It was briefly the third largest this month, overtaking Tether; and on January 1 of this year, it was sixth. The coin has made headlines over its dealings with the authorities. The SEC hit Ripple with a $1.3 billion lawsuit in 2020, alleging that the company sold unregistered securities to investors to raise funds. But last year, the company scored a partial win against the regulator when a judge ruled that programmatic sales of XRP on crypto exchanges to retail investors did not qualify as securities. The ruling was interpreted as a win by Ripple—and the crypto industry as a whole—despite the judge ruling that $728 million worth of tokens for institutional sales constituted unregistered securities sales. Let's call this one an honorable mention, given the title of this article. It’s been an incredible year for Bitcoin, and the world’s biggest asset manager has played a part by making the biggest and oldest cryptocurrency available to all via an ETF. The iShares Bitcoin Trust is a traditional investment vehicle that allows investors to buy and sell shares that track Bitcoin’s price. The shares are traded on the Nasdaq. When it started trading in January, IBIT broke record after record with trading volume and inflows: By December, it had more than $50 billion in assets under management, achieving the milestone in just 228 days—quicker than any other ETF in history. Several other top asset managers also have Bitcoin ETFs trading, but BlackRock’s product has been the most successful.

Oracle's co-founder has gained roughly $75 billion in paper wealth as the software company he started in 1979 enjoyed its biggest stock rally since 1999 and the dot-com boom. While the S&P 500 index has gained 27% in 2024, Oracle shares have shot up 63%, lifting Ellison's net worth to more than $217 billion, according to Forbes, behind only Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos among the world's richest people. At 80, Ellison is a senior citizen in the tech industry, where his fellow billionaire founders are generally decades younger. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, whose net worth has also ballooned past $200 billion, is half his age. But Ellison has found the fountain of youth both personally and professionally. After being divorced several times, Ellison was reported this month to be involved with a 33-year-old woman. And at a meeting with analysts in Las Vegas in September, Ellison was as engaged as ever, mentioning offhand that the night before, he and his son were having dinner with his good friend Musk, who's advising President-elect Donald Trump (then the Republican nominee) while running Tesla and his other ventures. His big financial boon has come from Oracle, which has maneuvered its way into the artificial intelligence craze with its cloud infrastructure technology and has made its databases more accessible. ChatGPT creator OpenAI said in June that it will use Oracle's cloud infrastructure. Earlier this month, Oracle said it had also picked up business from Meta. Startups, which often opt for market leader Amazon Web Services when picking a cloud, have been engaging Oracle as well. Last year, video generation startup Genmo set up a system to train an AI model with Nvidia graphics processing units, or GPUs, in Oracle's cloud, CEO Paras Jain said. Genmo now relies on the Oracle cloud to produce videos based on the prompts that users type in on its website. "Oracle produced a different product than what you can get elsewhere with GPU computing," Jain said. The company offers "bare metal" computers that can sometimes yield better performance than architectures that employ server virtualization, he said. In its latest earnings report earlier this month, Oracle came up short of analysts' estimates and issued a forecast that was also weaker than Wall Street was expecting. The next day, the stock fell 7% in the worst performance of the year, eating into the gains for 2024. Still, Ellison was bullish for the future. "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure trains several of the world's most important generative AI models because we are faster and less expensive than other clouds," Ellison said in the earnings release. For the current fiscal year, which ends in May, Oracle is expected to record revenue growth of about 10%, which would mark its second-strongest year of expansion since 2011. Jain said that when Genmo has challenges, he communicates with Oracle sales executives and engineers through a Slack channel. The collaboration has resulted in better reliability and performance, he said. Jain said Oracle worked with Genmo to ensure that developers could launch the startup's Mochi open-source video generator on Oracle's cloud hardware with a single click. "Oracle was also more price-competitive than these large hyperscalers," Jain said. Three months before its December earnings report, at the analyst event in Las Vegas, Oracle had given a rosy outlook for the next three years. Executive Vice President Doug Kehring declared that the company would produce more than $66 billion in revenue in the 2026 fiscal year, and over $104 billion in fiscal 2029. The numbers suggested acceleration, with a compound annual growth rate of over 16%, compared with 9% in the latest quarter. After Kehring and CEO Safra Catz spoke, it was Ellison's turn. The company's chairman, technology chief and top shareholder strutted onto the stage in a black sweater and jeans, waved to the analysts, licked his lips and sat down. For the next 74 minutes, he answered questions from seven analysts. "Did — did he say $104 billion?" Ellison said, referring to Kehring's projection. Some in the crowd giggled. "That's going to be so easy. It is kind of crazy." Oracle's revenue in fiscal 2023 was just shy of $50 billion. The new target impressed Eric Lynch, managing director of Scharf Investments, which held $167 million in Oracle shares at the end of September. "For a company doing single digits for a decade or so, that's unbelievable," Lynch told CNBC in an interview. Oracle is still far behind in cloud infrastructure. In 2023, Amazon controlled 39% of the market, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 8.2%, according to industry researcher Gartner. That left Oracle with 1.4%. But in database software, Oracle remains a stalwart. Gartner estimated that the company had 17% market share in database management systems in 2023. Ellison's challenge is to find opportunities for expansion. Last year, he visited Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, for the first time to announce a partnership that would enable organizations to use Oracle's database through Microsoft's Azure cloud. Microsoft even installed Oracle hardware in its data centers. In June, Oracle rolled out a similar announcement with Google. Then, in September, Oracle finally partnered with Amazon, introducing its database on AWS. Oracle and Amazon had exchanged barbs for years. AWS introduced a database called Aurora in 2014, and Amazon worked hard to move itself off Oracle. Following a CNBC report on the effort, Ellison expressed doubt about Amazon's ability to reach its goal. But the project succeeded. In 2019, Amazon published a blog post titled, "Migration Complete – Amazon's Consumer Business Just Turned off its Final Oracle Database." Ellison looked back on the history between the two companies at the analyst meeting in September. "I got kind of got cute commenting about Amazon uses Oracle, doesn't use AWS, blah, blah," he said. "And that hurt some people's feelings. I probably shouldn't have said it." He said a friend at a major New York bank had asked him to make sure the Oracle database works on AWS. "I said, 'Great. It makes sense to me,'" Ellison said. The multi-cloud strategy should deliver gains in database market share, said analyst Siti Panigrahi of Mizuho, which has the equivalent of a buy rating on Oracle shares. Cloud deals related to AI will also help Oracle deliver on its promise for faster revenue growth, he said. "Oracle right now has an end-to-end stack for enterprises to build their AI strategy," said Panigrahi, who worked on applications at Oracle in the 2000s. So far, Oracle has been mainly cutting high-value AI deals with the likes of OpenAI and Musk's X.ai. Of Oracle's $97 billion in remaining performance obligations, or revenue that hasn't yet been recognized, 40% or 50% of it is tied to renting out GPUs, Panigrahi said. Oracle didn't respond to a request for comment. Panigrahi predicts that a wider swath of enterprises will begin adopting AI, which will be a boon to Oracle given its hundreds of thousands of big customers. There's also promise in Oracle Health, the segment that came out of the company's $28.2 billion acquisition of electronic health record software vendor Cerner in 2022. Unlike rival Epic, Oracle Health lost U.S. market share in 2023, according to estimates from KLAS Research. But Ellison's connection to Musk, who is set to co-lead Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, might benefit Oracle Health "if there is a bigger push towards modernizing existing healthcare systems," analysts at Evercore said in a note last week. They recommend buying the stock. For now, Oracle is busy using AI to rewrite Cerner's entire code base, Ellison said at the analyst event. "This is another pillar for growth," he said. "I think you haven't quite seen it yet." Hours earlier, Ellison had put in a call to Marc Benioff, co-founder and CEO of Salesforce. Benioff knows Ellison as well as anyone, having worked for him for 13 years before starting the cloud software company that's now a big competitor. "It was awesome," Benioff said in a wide-ranging interview the next day, regarding his chat with Ellison. Benioff spoke about his former boss's latest run of fortune. "Larry really deeply wants this," Benioff said. "This is very important to him, that he is building a great company, what he believes is one of the most important companies in the world, and also, wealth is very important to him."

December 26, 2024 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Dec. 26, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs”. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Trump is surrounding himself with a tight-knit group of right-wing tech barons

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with an interconnected group of tech barons. President-elect Donald Trump has surrounded himself with a tight-knit group of wealthy tech barons whose ideas will help define his second term in the White House. Three key allies — members of a group known as “the PayPal Mafia” for their involvement in the money-transfer company two decades ago — seem to be shaping policy and staffing decisions in Trump’s incoming administration, and they are part of an expansive right-wing tech network that will accompany Trump back into power. The network is highly interconnected, sharing not only a political alliance but also social ties, investment opportunities, anti-regulatory ideas and geographic proximity in Austin, Texas, or Northern California. Some of their friendships and professional connections go back decades, and almost all the members of the network are men. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has been called the “shadow president” or “first buddy,” and he wants to take a hatchet to the federal budget at Trump’s request as co-lead of the newly formed “Department of Government Efficiency” with biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy. David Sacks, a tech investor and podcaster, will have the role of Trump’s tech “czar,” advising him on artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. Peter Thiel, a longtime Trump supporter, has given the incoming Trump administration a staffing pipeline filled with at least 10 of his former co-workers, employees or investing partners — including Vice President-elect JD Vance. And dozens of other tech figures are now orbiting in Trump’s gravity, as either informal advisers, government officials-in-waiting or supporters pushing Trump’s agenda from outside Washington. While some converted to his side only recently, many of the tech figures know one another very well. “They’ve turned profits into power,” said Rob Lalka, author of the book “The Venture Alchemists,” which came out this year and profiled many of the figures who are headed into the administration. Lalka, a professor at Tulane University’s Freeman School of Business, said several characteristics define the technologists surrounding Trump, including their wealth and skepticism of institutions and the heavily online personas they’ve created. And he said they have a shared history, with many of them overlapping at Stanford University during and after Thiel’s time there. “That contrarianism, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. It comes from real-life experiences they had as college students,” he said. In other words: A right-wing faction has coalesced within the usually progressive tech industry, and much of it is preparing to make Washington a second home for the next four years. The Trump transition team describes it as a natural fit. “President Trump’s agenda includes economic, energy and regulatory policies that will allow the US to reclaim its global dominance of innovation and technology,” Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the transition, said in a statement. “President Trump is surrounding himself with industry leaders like Elon Musk as he works to restore innovation, reduce regulation, and celebrate free speech in his second term,” he said. Musk, Sacks and Thiel didn’t respond to requests for comment on the transition. Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, said it’s notable that many in the tech industry crowd that’s close to Trump don’t come from the biggest-name tech companies, such as Meta, Google, Apple and Microsoft. “This specific group is unique because it’s coming a lot from venture,” he said, referring to venture capitalists who invest in startups. “Venture is very different from Big Seven incumbent tech. The Big Seven incumbent tech, those people are trying to be very neutral.” The Magnificent 7 collection of tech companies includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, NVIDIA and Tesla. Venture capitalists often are less interested in corporate initiatives such as diversity programs, he said. Instead, they have a reputation for ruthless competition, focusing in their most extreme moments on growth at all costs and upending the existing order. “The contrarian culture of Silicon Valley and venture has pushed back against big corporate ideas coming out of the professional managerial class,” he said. Trump’s second term won’t be the first administration to have strong influence from the modern tech industry. The Obama administration was closely tied to tech, especially to Google and its executives, such as former CEO Eric Schmidt. But there’s little overlap between the tech figures who advised President Barack Obama and those working now for Trump. And there’s a different dynamic this time around, said Nathan Leamer, a Republican consultant in Washington and CEO of Fixed Gear Strategies. “Obama was following Big Tech’s lead in 2008, and there was an excitement that the Obama administration’s approach to tech mirrored the blogosphere and early Twitter and how these companies saw themselves as fitting into the world,” he said. “The difference now is that, with Trump, it’s following the Republican Party’s lead,” he said. “Tech is watching Republican leaders and realizing that they have to get in the game. Otherwise, they’re going to be left out.” Previously Trump-skeptical tech companies such as Meta, Amazon and OpenAI are each giving at least $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, donations that Trump can use for whatever purpose he wants. Setting a tone near the top of the new administration will be Vance, who worked for one of Thiel’s venture capital funds, Mithril Capital, after law school and has benefited ever since from the association. Thiel was one of the main backers of Vance’s run for the Senate in Ohio in 2022. “From the top, you see that connection with Silicon Valley,” Leamer said. (He noted that Trump himself now qualifies as a tech investor, with a majority stake in the parent company of Truth Social, Trump Media & Technology Group Corp.) Leamer said that while some industries rely on Washington-based trade and lobbying organizations to be the faces of their businesses, figures such as Musk, Sacks and Thiel pursue a different model: cutting out the trade groups as middlemen and speaking directly to large audiences through social media and podcasts. “These are the people behind the microphone,” he said. “It’s fitting that these very famous people are now disintermediating the marketplace.” Trump’s choices for Cabinet-level nominations are generally people from political backgrounds, including members of Congress, Republican governors and campaign loyalists. But just below that level, tech figures are populating some of the most important positions. Jacob Helberg, an adviser to the government contractor Palantir Technologies and the husband of another ex-PayPal executive, Keith Rabois, is Trump’s pick for undersecretary of state for economic growth, energy and the environment. A tech investor, Trae Stephens, a co-founder of the defense contractor Anduril and a partner at Thiel’s Founders Fund, has been under consideration for Defense Department jobs, according to Politico and The Wall Street Journal. Jim O’Neill, former CEO of the Thiel Foundation, is Trump’s choice for the No. 2 job at the Department of Health and Human Services. Trump has named Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, for the Pentagon’s top research job. Vance’s economic adviser Gail Slater, who has worked for Fox Corp., Roku and a now-defunct trade group called the Internet Association, is Trump’s choice to lead antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department. Announcing his choice of Slater on Truth Social, Trump highlighted the conflicts between large incumbent tech firms and the tech startups that have venture capitalists’ backing: “Big Tech has run wild for years, stifling competition in our most innovative sector and, as we all know, using its market power to crack down on the rights of so many Americans, as well as those of Little Tech!” Trump has also designated appointees friendly to the same tech faction to lead the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. But there are hundreds or thousands of potential appointments still to come in the middle levels of the bureaucracy where other tech figures could end up. Vance said in a 2021 podcast interview that if Trump were to win another term, he should replace all federal civil servants with “our people,” meaning conservatives. Lalka, of Tulane University, said that for all the rhetoric about meritocracy coming from right-leaning tech entrepreneurs and investors, Vance’s vision for the federal workforce is more like the opposite. “That is literally ‘to the victor go the spoils’ from the 19th century,” he said. “It’s not how you attract top talent.” Malhotra, of Stanford, said one outstanding question is how many tech figures will take full-time jobs in government rather than part-time ones. Sacks’ White House role, for example, is expected to be part-time only, and Musk’s task of co-leading an efficiency commission also won’t be his day job. “That’s going to really limit their power,” he said of the part-time roles. “This is a really good way for Trump to marginalize these people and give them the facade that they’re powerful.” Despite his part-time role, though, Musk has lately left his imprint on the transition by helping block a government funding bill and globe-trotting with Trump to meet foreign leaders. There’s a long list of actions that Trump’s tech appointees are expected to tackle, including deregulation of the cryptocurrency industry, fewer constraints on artificial intelligence development, easier environmental approval for projects such as Musk’s SpaceX rocket launches, a shakeup in antitrust enforcement, an overhaul of military procurement and, with congressional approval, low tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals. Adam Kovacevich, the CEO of Chamber of Progress, a Democratic tech industry organization, said that despite Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in November, he’s trying to see potential upside for tech overall in part because of who’s advising Trump. “You have to go into the new administration with optimism,” he said. “A lot of these people who have supported Trump, they’ve supported Democrats in the past, so we’re not necessarily talking about people who are always in the Republican corner,” he said. Tech figures in that category include Musk, Sacks and investor Marc Andreessen, who recently said he’s spending half his time at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida advising on the transition. Kovacevich said he believes their alliance with Trump is best thought of as a narrow reaction against President Joe Biden, a longtime skeptic of the tech industry, rather than a complete rejection of Democratic politics. Kovacevich said he thinks Trump won’t be able to follow through on some of his most radical ideas about technology, including forcing social media platforms to further bend their content moderation in favor of conservative users. “Any efforts there will probably run into a First Amendment buzzsaw,” he said. One closely watched question: How much money will Trump’s tech allies make during his administration? Musk’s wealth has soared 70% since last month’s election, to about $450 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — fueling progressive theories that he and others in tech are motivated by a desire to increase their net worth. The stock price of Palantir Technologies, a government contractor, has roughly doubled since the election, and defense tech startup firms such as Anduril have also expressed optimism about increased sales during the new administration. Leamer, the Republican consultant, said he thinks Trump’s tech allies have a different motivation: to prove that they’re right. “I think they see it as a chance to put their ideas into practice,” he said. “These individuals have been thinking about these ideas, and they really have an interest in entrepreneurship and the future of the country.” CORRECTION (Dec. 26, 2024, 1:00 p.m. ET): A diagram in a previous version of this article included a wrong photo.

Title: RICH BODY

. For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. Just be focused on one thing at a time? When is future forecasting good and when is it bad? Anti normies When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Title: What will 2025 bring for Linux PCs?

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. The year ahead has a lot in store for Linux users. Many of the trends, hardware products, and software developments below comprise a colorful mix that focuses on the use of Linux in particular. We also include other current and future events in hardware and software that will influence or characterize everyday IT life — Linux or otherwise. The upshot is that Linux users will see a lot of change on the horizon. Raspberry Pi Foundation Since the Raspberry Pi Foundation went public in mid-2024, the future of the successful board computer has been quite uncertain. The share price has been volatile since then, but has held up reasonably well overall. The fresh millions on the stock market open up opportunities for technical innovations for the mini-computer, but on the other hand the project is moving away from its non-profit origins. Nothing concrete is currently known about future models, but prices will be higher than before. The continued production and stocking of older models, as was previously the case, could also fall victim to profit maximization. See also: 10 surprisingly practical Raspberry Pi projects anybody can do The Gnome 47 and KDE Plasma 6 desktops are forcing the switch to the Wayland display protocol by setting Wayland as the standard despite some remaining detail problems. Most Linux distributions with these desktops (Fedora, Ubuntu, Kubuntu, KDE Neon, Endeavour, et cetera) will follow this specification in 2025. The fact remains, however, that apart from Gnome and KDE, only the niche desktop Enlightenment (current version E20) is aggressively pushing for Wayland. The Gnome-like Budgie desktop, as well as Cinnamon (Linux Mint) and Mate, still offer Wayland as an “experimental” option. XFCE (announced for the upcoming version 4.20) and LXQT are just starting their Wayland conversion. Cinnamon running in Wayland. Linux Mint The replacement of the old X11 window system will obviously continue well beyond 2025. This is a stumbling block, not least because every Wayland operation currently still has to drag along the Xwayland mediation layer in order to be able to display older X11 windows. The current Gnome 47 is the first Linux desktop that is at least technically prepared to completely dispense with Xwayland in the future. Debian A new Debian version is released approximately every two years. After version 12 “Bookworm,” which was released in 2023, Debian 13 (“Trixie”) is due in 2025. With Debian “Forky,” the name for version 14 has already been decided. Debian 13 will continue to offer a variant for 32-bit processors, but no longer for very old i386 CPUs, but at least from i686 onwards. i686 CPUs are also ancient processors such as Pentium Pro, Pentium II, Pentium III, and some early Pentium 4 models. The oldest of these CPUs are over 25 years old and date back to the 20th century. Regardless of Debian’s 32-bit continuity, the recycling of such oldies is usually unsatisfactory. New Debian is always immensely important because many derivatives are based on Debian and must also be updated as a result — such as Antix, Bunsenlabs, Kanotix, MX Linux, Linux Mint Debian, Ope Media Vault, Pi-OS, Rescuezilla, Sparky, Q4-OS, Tails, and many more (Ubuntus!). Ubuntu After April 2025, there will be no more update support for Ubuntu 20.04, unless you have taken out the 10-year ESM (Expanded Security Maintenance) support with Ubuntu Pro. On devices with version 20.04, you will then either have to reinstall or make up for several upgrade stages. A new installation with the current LTS version Ubuntu 24.04 is particularly recommended for systems that work as servers. After 14 October 2025, Microsoft will no longer offer free updates for Windows 10 and technical support will be discontinued (EOL, End of Life). As a simple upgrade to Windows 11 will fail for many laptops and PCs due to the high hardware requirements, a significant wave of users switching to Linux desktops can be expected over the course of the next year. Last year’s Linux growth to a market share of around 4.5 percent is probably already linked to this Windows date. Unicon is launching the eLux operating system for companies. The system is designed to combine security, hardware flexibility, and performance. The download requires registration with an email address. Windows 10 will be discontinued on 1 October 2025. If Windows 11 does not run on the hardware, any (even more demanding) Linux will run. Anton Watman/Shutterstock.com Experience has shown that Linux distributions are generally too fragmented to make concerted and aggressive use of the opportunities offered by the Windows runtime. Only some of the typical Windows detractors such as Linux Mint or Zorin-OS will refer to their Windows-like concepts and optimize them. In addition, most tried-and-tested Linux desktops (mostly Debian/Ubuntu-based, in some cases also Arch-based) are also suitable as Windows 10 alternatives. See also: 3 free Linux distros that look and feel like Windows Open Suse Leap 16.0, the successor to Leap 15.6, is not expected until mid-2025 at the earliest. Version 16 aims to end the technical continuity with the previous Leap, but at least promises the possibility of a direct upgrade to Leap 16. If necessary, an interim version 15.7 will be added. openSUSE Open Suse Leap 16 will be an “immutable” Linux. Suse is developing its own Adaptable Linux Platform (ALP) architecture with a write-protected base system that increases security and stability. The required software is to be provided by isolated containers — presumably flatpaks. With its focus on cloud systems and automated system management, Open Suse Leap 16 is likely to follow the trend of recent years. The Suse system is becoming increasingly uninteresting for the needs of a flexible end-user desktop. The same applies to Fedora Workstation, which in the Silverblue “Immutable” version is signalling the path that Fedora generally wants to take. The security and maintenance advantages of the immutable concept are aimed at cloud and server instances and mainly have disadvantages on the desktop. Nix It is perhaps not necessarily the Linux distribution Nix-OS itself, but its concept of “declarative configuration,” which probably has a great future ahead of it. Nix-OS uses a central configuration file as a meta-level. This allows the entire system to be reproduced identically (e.g. for cloud and server instances), but can also be reset to previous system states (relevant for servers and desktops). Package dependencies are avoided because — similar to container formats — software is always stored separately with all dependencies. The concept requires a lot of storage space and the adoption of completely customized methods for package installations and updates. Cloud providers are already in the thick of it, but Nix-OS should still provide some additional convenience features for desktop users. While Microsoft has included the sudo tool as an option for developers in Windows 10/11 in 2024, leading Linux developers want to abolish sudo or offer a better alternative. The new run0 tool is already available in the latest versions of the Systemd init system. IDG In future Linux distributions, run0 will certainly not immediately replace the familiar sudo, but will at best run as an alternative for the time being. The run0 tool has several advantages over sudo: In principle, it requires no configuration, whereas sudo requires the not entirely uncomplicated “/etc/ sudoer.” run0 is based on Polkit, whose individual configuration is not simpler, but is usually unnecessary. As run0 loads an isolated systemd target, it is more secure than sudo, which relies on rights masks in the file system (SUID bit). In addition, run0 gives visual signals in the terminal and window title to indicate the current elevated permissions. We have barely gotten used to the new term IoT (Internet of Things) when the next “internet” is added. IoB — Internet of Behavior — is more or less a consequence of IoT: the Internet of Things with smartwatches, webcams, health trackers, sensors, measuring stations, and smart home devices expands the data material that websites and apps collect through direct communication. IoT provides masses of additional data that can be analyzed statistically (trends, anomalies, causalities). These IoB statistics and behavioral analysis are not only driven by the retail and advertising industries: IoB can provide insurance companies, health insurance companies, traffic planners, the police, and entrepreneurs with interesting information and correlations that do not necessarily have to be personalized. It is not yet clear which IoB analysis will become part of everyday life in the future. Data protectionists are already warning that there is a lack of transparent user consent for data collection. In the context of the growing customs dispute between the USA, EU, and China, Huawei is preparing to say goodbye to Windows operating systems on its laptops. In the future, the Chinese manufacturer intends to offer its self-developed Harmony OS operating system. Harmony OS is based on its own Linux-independent (Hongmeng) kernel. The operating system was previously only planned for Huawei smartphones, but will also be available for laptops in the future. Huawei laptops will run Harmony OS from mid-2025. Microsoft is thus losing a major Windows customer. Huawei Harmony OS is said to perform better than Linux desktops. It is entirely plausible that the Chinese IT giant can achieve this for the hardware it produces itself. However, compatibility with software is problematic. It is not yet clear to what extent Harmony OS will also offer customized standard software or integrate it via a translation layer. Potential buyers of the attractively priced Huawei laptops should consider this question carefully. TP-Link Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) is five years old, many older routers and devices still work with 802.11ac or even older 802.11n. From 2024, there will be more and more devices with radio chips of the new Wi-Fi generation 7 (802.11be). The Linux kernel is prepared for this — from version 6.5 to be precise. Wi-Fi 7 will not only significantly increase data throughput, but will also use MLO (Multi-Link Operation) to communicate across multiple radio bands between the transmitter and receiver devices. This improves both throughput and stability. New DDR5 RAM modules with higher speeds and lower latency will come onto the market in 2025. However, DDR6 is already on the runway: The next generation of DDR RAM is not due to be released until the end of 2025 at the earliest. DDR6 will again be significantly faster than current DDR5 RAM. The specification speaks of at least 8800 MT/s (megatransfers per second) for the first DDR6 generation, which is roughly double that of DDR5. Later DDR6 components should then achieve up to 21,000 MT/s. G.Skill Innovative graphics formats have been flourishing in photography and imaging for years, but they have been very slow to catch on. While all browsers and many image editing applications now support the Google Webp format, the Apple HEIF/HEIC format and the JPEG successor JPEG XL still need help from add-ons for software or additional packages for the system on many systems and image viewers. REDPIXEL.PL The High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) is favored by iPhones for photos. HEIC is the associated container format that also stores image sequences, comments, and audio in addition to (HEIF) images. JPEG XL (jxl) is the designated successor to the long-standing JPG standard. In 2025, it is expected that all Linux distributions will increasingly prepare their viewers and file managers for these formats. Experience has shown that the question of which image format will prevail is obsolete: There will simply be a few more in the future, while JPG, PNG, and others will continue to exist. There is no question that there will be no standstill in CPU development in 2025. AMD will introduce new Ryzen CPUs such as “Kraken” and Intel is planning Panther Lake processors based on its latest production technology (18A). The goals are the same — more performance, more efficiency. Alexander56891 / Shutterstock.com Regardless of new CPU records, the new (marketing) term “AI PC” or Copilot PC (Microsoft) will come into focus. In this product class, which performs AI functions on the local device, a fast CPU is not enough — at least a dedicated GPU graphics chip (preferably Nvidia), plenty of DDR5 RAM, and a fast SSD are also required. The more obvious feature that distinguishes an AI PC from a gaming PC or a powerful workstation is the additional NPU chip (Neural Processing Unit). NPUs cannot process AI models any better or faster than the GPU, but they are much more energy-efficient. In other words: computer bolides are AI-capable, but only energy-efficient with an additional NPU. Processors with an NPU extension already exist — from Intel (Lunar Lake), AMD (Ryzen AI), and Qualcomm (Snapdragon). However, it is not yet clear how future-proof these first NPUs are. See also: The AI PC revolution: 18 essential terms you need to know Mass storage devices are experiencing continuous capacity growth every year. New records are on the horizon for 2025: SSD: The maximum capacity of SSDs is expected to increase from the current maximum of around 60TB to 128TB by mid-2025, more than doubling. This has been announced by several manufacturers such as Western Digital, Huawei, and Samsung. Mechanical drives: The classic hard drive is reaching its technical limits and has already seen its greatest leaps in capacity. However, the current maximum of 24- to 32TB should be able to be increased again in future thanks to new HAMR technology (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is announcing drives with 40TB for 2025, and up to 60- or 80TB by the end of the decade. Jon L. Jacobi NVMe SSD: Capacities of up to 16TB are expected for M.2 NVMe storage on the PCI Express bus by 2025. This means a doubling of the currently largest NVMe SSDs. For end users, the record capacities are hardly relevant and generally hardly affordable. More important is the market law that with new, faster, and larger media, the prices for smaller and medium capacities will fall. USB 4 is the joint successor to USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 with a theoretical maximum throughput of 40Gbps (approx. 5GB/s). USB 4v2 (also “USB 4.0 Gen 4” and more recently “USB4 2.0”) theoretically achieves 80- or 120Gbps. The first controllers and drives of this generation are already on the market. Drivers for USB 4v2 are included in the current Linux kernel. This article originally appeared on our sister publication PC-WELT and was translated and localized from German.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us The tech layoff wave is still going strong in 2024. Following significant workforce reductions in 2022 and 2023, this year has more than 130,000 job cuts across 457 companies, according to independent layoffs tracker Layoffs.fyi. Companies like Tesla, Amazon, Google, TikTok, Snap and Microsoft have conducted sizable layoffs in the first months of 2024. Smaller-sized startups have also seen a fair amount of cuts, and in some cases, have shut down operations altogether. By tracking these layoffs, we’re able to understand the impact on innovation across companies large and small. We’re also able to see the potential impact of businesses embracing AI and automation for jobs that had previously been considered safe. It also serves as a reminder of the human impact of layoffs and what could be at stake in regards to increased innovation. Below you’ll find a comprehensive list of all the known layoffs in tech that have occurred in 2024, to be updated regularly. If you have a tip on a layoff, contact us here. If you prefer to remain anonymous, you can contact us here. Ceased operations and laid off about 1,000 workers. But the company might be saved after all: Lilium announced that a consortium of investors agreed to acquire two subsidiaries, which would allow it to restructure and exit insolvency. Has laid off 45 employees, accounting for 5% of its total workforce. A spokesperson told The Boston Globe the cuts impacted “nearly every function throughout the business.” Is cutting 22% of its workforce as it attempts to expand into new product lines. The total number of workers impacted is not currently known. Is undergoing another layoff round two months after the EV startup relocated employees to Texas to avoid bankruptcy. More than 20 employees were included in the cuts. Eliminated 27% of its workforce. The cuts include 16% of its U.S.-based employees, as well as a “small team in India,” affecting a total of 74 workers. Laid off 70 employees, roughly 13% of its workforce. The cuts impacted teams in engineering, customer experience, marketing, and billing. Laid off around 25% of its cybersecurity team — known as The Paranoids — over the last year, TechCrunch has learned. The cuts impacted 40 to 50 employees out of a total staff of 200. Is cutting 100 employees, impacting its global workforce by roughly 18%. It’s the fintech company’s second layoff round in six months. Has abruptly shut down. The news follows several lawsuits filed against the proptech company and an FTC consumer alert about controversial sale-leaseback models. Is eliminating 76 roles in a reorganization effort. The cuts account for about 7% of the Singapore-based company’s total headcount. Is shutting down its operations, co-founders Kerry Schrader and Ashlee Ammons Halpin announced. Reportedly laid off 40% of its roughly 220-person workforce in a major restructuring effort following the departure of CEO Liza Landsman in September. Has laid off 60 employees in one of its B2B units as the company shifts its focus to AI. Will lay off roughly 200 employees as part of a “strategic review” of its business while exploring a potential sale. The company cut 280 workers in April as part of a restructuring effort. Laid off 150 employees, impacting 8% of its workforce, in a new restructuring effort following its July 2024 acquisition of Tegus. Is reportedly letting go of up to 500 employees in an effort to boost its profitability. The cuts would impact more than 10% of its total workforce. Cut roughly 10% of its workforce, affecting 60-65 employees, as the online travel agency conducts another reorganization attempt. Eliminated 202 employees, accounting for roughly 1% of its total workforce. The cuts impacted engineering and customer support roles, spokesperson Greg Snapper confirmed to The Information. Is cutting 13% of its workforce and shifting its staff of clinical therapists to part-time or contract roles in an effort to “reset” the unicorn startup. It’s unknown exactly how many employees were impacted. Reportedly laid off roughly a quarter of its employees. Sources told City AM that the former unicorn startup cut 71 roles before announcing a $50 million funding round. Announced 120 layoffs in a new WARN filing. The filing comes a week after the advertising software company hit a $97.7 billion valuation. Has shut down its operations after four years in business, CEO Raj Kunkolienkar announced on LinkedIn. Is laying off 4% of its workforce to focus on “large growth opportunities.” AMD had roughly 26,000 employees as of last year, so the cuts could impact approximately 1,000 workers. Is cutting 40% of its workforce, impacting more than 200 employees, as part of a restructuring effort at the company. Since going public in 2021, 23andMe has lost more than 99% of its value amid declining interest in its products and subscriptions, plus a data breach in 2023 that resulted in 7 million users’ ancestry data being stolen. Is laying off 319 employees, accounting for 21% of its total staff, as it struggles to compete with ChatGPT and other AI products. Like 23andMe, at the time of writing, Chegg has also lost 99% of its valuation since going public in 2013. Is laying off roughly 500 workers, affecting 17% of the solar and EV charging company’s total workforce. Enphase laid off 10% of its workforce less than a year ago, as they and other solar companies continue to face significant headwinds. Is shutting down after five years of operation. In 2020, the supersonic aircraft startup joined Y Combinator’s Winter cohort in 2020 and went on to raise over $4.5 million. Is laying off 660 employees globally, accounting for 13% of the company’s total workforce, as the software-as-a-service company for customer and IT service management aims to finish a restructuring effort by the end of the year. The cloud computing company is eliminating 2.5% of its workforce, impacting roughly 250 employees. The company made a similar sized cut to its workforce at the beginning of 2023. Announced it will cut nearly 200 jobs in North Carolina, shortly after its acquisition by Progress Software Corp. Is reducing its headcount by 300 employees, accounting for 2% of the food delivery company’s total work force. Is laying off 105 employees — about 16% of the company’s workforce. The move comes after iRobot slashed roughly 350 jobs earlier this year, following the scuttling of an acquisition by Amazon for $1.7 billion. Has laid off 30% of its employees as the organization says it faces a “relentless onslaught of change.” It’s the second layoff round at Mozilla this year. Reportedly cut 10% of its staff, impacting roughly 60 employees. In October 2024, the company announced a $125 million Series F Round. Is shutting down its operations. The agtech company was valued at $2.3 billion in 2021. Is conducting another round of layoffs, reportedly impacting up to 100 employees. CEO Jack Dorseytold employees in an email that the company needs to operate “like a startup again.” Reportedly conducted a round of layoffs. The number of employees impacted is currently unknown. Cut 10% of its total workforce as the education company struggles with its customers not renewing their subscriptions. Is letting go of 20% of its workforce as the company undergoes what CEO Drew Houston calls a “transitional period.” The reduction in headcount will impact 528 employees. Has laid off 20% of its total workforce as it faces struggles in the Ethereum market. Is trimming its global workforce by nearly 2% in a cost-cutting measure, impacting roughly 100 employees. Is pulling out of almost all of its major markets in the U.S. and has cut its workforce roughly in half as it shifts its focus on just San Francisco and New York City. Is reducing its total workforce by 21% as the company aims to generate $60 million in annual cost savings. Will lay off 100 employees after being acquired by risk and vendor management company Ncontracts. Is laying off staff in a reorganization effort impacting 22 employees in the U.S. Cuts will reportedly also impact staffers in France in the coming months. Has been shut down, founder Sheena Allen wrote on LinkedIn. The Y Combinator-backed fintech sought to bring financial services to people in banking deserts.Meta Employees across multiple teams across Meta have been laid off as the company looks to “ensure resources are aligned with their long-term strategic goals,” in the words of its emailed statement to TechCrunch. What Meta did not detail was the scope or specific teams affected by the layoffs, though Threads, recruiting and legal were confirmed not to be unaffected. Will cut 10% of its workforce, impacting roughly 17,000 employees. The cuts follow a loss of $9.97 a share in Q3 amid a continued machinist union strike. Is laying off 1,100 employees in Michigan, impacting the company’s subsidiary brands Chrysler, Jeep, Ram, and Dodge. Is laying off hundreds of employees, mainly in Malaysia, as the social network turns to AI for content moderation. The company said fewer than 500 people were affected. Is cutting jobs in Southeast Asia and Australia to “improve operational efficiency.” A spokesperson told TechCrunch that it hasn’t “set a target number for any particular positions,” though the cuts could impact roughly 10% of workers in those markets Is shutting down its UK office and laying off dozens of workers, TechCrunch has learned. The cuts come just three months after the company started closing down its U.S. operations. Laid off four employees as the firm looks to “rebalance” its resources from its software and product teams to its investing team, general partner Pete Flint told TechCrunch. Is laying off 500 employees as it begins winding down its operations.

Title: The Goal is Higher Testosterone, Not Muscle?

Time Published: 2024-12-24T17:51:26Z
Full Content:
For example ,,, ￼ you would not want to be the world’s most muscular and glorious demigod body if you only got two hours of sleep a night, and felt like you were physiologically dying, and had very low testosterone. ￼ Similarly speaking, it wouldn’t matter if you were like the worlds strongest man, you could lift like 100,000 pounds or whatever, but, once again, you had naturally low mood, low testosterone, and once again only slept two hours a night? So one random thought I have in regards to fitness is the criticality of sleep and recovery. For example, I think I have a simple antidote, to reset your circadian rhythm, or sleep patterns, for dinner, the night prior, eat a shit load of beef ribs. Why beef ribs? First, ancient Greek literature, the Iliad confirms this. ￼￼ For example, when Achilles had his friends joined him in his hut, he carved out the backbone of the ox, often prized, the most choice meat. Also, it is easily accessible, you could find it at any Costco, even Food 4 Less. Even with the price of inflation, it is still affordable, around 499 a pound, or 449 a pound. I found a very very simple recipe, just take a baking tray and cover it with aluminum foil, and you don’t even have to season the ribs or prepare them, just put them directly on the aluminum foil, heat the oven at 325°, let it cook for an hour and a half, and boom you’re done! And then later you could just coat it with some salt pepper and garlic powder, and smoked paprika is actually good too. Anyways, after consuming about two trays of beef ribs, I’ve been sleeping way better, like on average another two or three hours a night, which I feel at least 500% better in the morning? The weird idea is in a lot of self improvement circles is that waking up super early every day, at like 3:30 AM or for whatever is considered virtuous. No. I would actually say that the ultimate virtue and active mainlines is to try to secure at least 8 to 12 hours of sleep a night. Why? Simple biology; assuming that during the day you are doing some sort of physical exercise and weightlifting, then what that then means is that the corresponding rest and recovery time will also be in similar accordance. Also, a simple thoughts; the stronger you become the heavier way to lift, you must also correspondingly spend equal amounts of time stretching, warming up etc. For example on the road to hitting my legendary thousand pound Atlas lift, all of these low testosterone guys would always tell me ￼“be careful”, which was their strange way of trying to feel superior to me that they thought I was doing something foolish in which I actually might injure myself? The simple idea that I have is once again, obviously! The higher weight you go, the more careful you become. And my personal way of mitigating safety was simple; spending at least two or three times more effort stretching warming up, doing dynamic exercise exercises like a bunch of yoga stuff on steroids. And this is where a lot of fools also don’t understand; when that would be warming up for my really really heavy weight lifts, I would also do a lot of calisthenics that looks like I would just do a single muscle up to warm up, planches etc. ￼ So currently my practical thought is the best car or vehicle to own in LA, maybe anywhere in Southern California, maybe even America is probably a white Toyota plug-in Prius prime. Why? First, once again you want to have the best of all worlds! For example, when you become dumb rich, it ain’t about showing off, rather, it is about adding more convenience to your life. For example, you want maximum optionality. What that means is you want to have access to gasoline pumps when necessary, and also you want to have access to electric charging ports when also available. But you don’t want to be dependent on either. ￼ Once again, do you want to have the optional not the dependence. So I just finished reading principles of economics by Saifedean, and one really really fascinating idea I encountered is this idea that perhaps, what if a lot of these doomsday Colts were simply predicated on false science math and philosophical principles? For example, just ChatGPT; what percentage of the earths crust has been mined for oil, and it will spit out an absurdly tiny number. Also all this hysteria when it comes to carbon dioxide and carbon footprint whatever; also once again, just ChatGPT the percentage of carbon in the earths atmosphere, compared to nitrogen which is about 70%, oxygen which is about 20%, and carbon which I think is like .01%? Anyways, I think the biggest issue here is that almost 99.9999% of all these doomsday cults is that once again, the world is going to shit, and it is precisely because we are boiling the earth, carbon footprint, running out of oil etc. But what if I could tell you, that with 100% certainty that human beings will be fine for the next hundred million years on planet earth, and even at the rate we are going, we have only tapped .001% of the earths natural gas and oil supply, in that, we would never run out of natural minerals even for the next hundred billion years? Certainly I cannot make this prediction but this is a thought experiment. If this were the case, then what? ￼￼ anyways, the reason why I think this is important is that even though I am 100% fan of Tesla Elon Musk, the truth is, getting an electric vehicle or a Tesla is more about fashion rather than saving the planet or whatever. Even an ancient Taoist philosophy says this; How dare you have the audacity to think that somehow the planet needs your help? I think there are virtues to arrogance, but also, the arrogant line of thinking that somehow the Earth needs our help, is also an arrogant thought? Sandbox thinking So currently I really really like this idea of a sandbox. The general idea is that what if we lived in the world in which we had unlimited time unlimited resources, essentially god mode, then how would we proceeded and live life? ￼￼ first, I think 99.9999% of the current modern-day misery that most humans face is body poverty. It don’t matter if you make seven figures or eight figures at Google, at Apple, Meta or Facebook whatever; it seems that almost all these people that I know who work in tech, all of them have extreme bodily poverty? Once again, not enough time weightlifting, too much time jerking off to VR porn, or going on Reddit late at night, with incognito browser on, or their VPN on with pirate bay, whatever it may be. Also, not enough meat consumption. All of these bizarre virtues signaling folks with plant-based diets whatever. Also once again, this anti-sleep mentality, the strange idea that sleeping is a vice? I find everybody on all sides of the political spectrum bad. Republicans and Democrats are bad, Libertarians are bad, moderates are bad etc. The left the right the alt left the alt right whatever. ￼ I don’t know any independent thinkers. All thinkers are dependent on others, nobody stands on their own two feet. I think currently the only independent thinkers that I appreciate and love include Elon Musk, Steve Jobs, Kanye West, Jeff Bezos, Michael Saylor, NASSIM Taleb etc. But once again, these individuals are good role models but not the end in itself. For example you could spend 100,000 years studying Elon Musk but the truth of the matter is you do not want to become Elon Musk. Why? The critical issue here is he has extreme body poverty until you see him topless on a yacht, with a golden bronze tan, and a six pack, don’t follow him. In some ways Jeff Bezos might be a better guide, look at him, he’s so fucking jacked. But then again I’m pretty sure that Bezos is on the juice, I’m sure he trains good, but he also does steroids good. Michael Saylor is a good example, he knows the virtues of intermittent fasting, and at the age of 59 he looks great! But I also think that maybe he could get into weightlifting; I want to see a sleeveless Michael Saylor with huge guns. MSTR FOLKS email me at Eric@erickim.com for tips So some simple training ideas: First, killing 10 birds with one stone. What that means is just go on a morning walk around town, with your 60 pound weight vest on! Titan.fitness is good ￼ Also, a very simple thing you could do is just get those wooden gymnast rings, you get on Amazon or Titan fitness, and just hook it up in your garage or backyard your front lawn, on a tree, your parking spot whatever ,,, and with your 60 pound weighted vest on, just do a few ups dips, “skin the cat”, Essentially an exercise in which you’re holding the rings you do kind of a backflip and un backflip it again, planches etc. ￼ Currently I think actually one of the most underrated exercises is the rack pull. Essentially, you rack your barbell at around waist level, and then you load it up with weights, and then you kind of do like a mini hip thrust, and you just get it off the rack for like half an inch and you’re done. Imagine like doing like a super mini deadlift, but it is far superior because you don’t have to deal with racking and unracking the weights annoyingly off the floor, and also, the transfer injury is almost nailed because there is not much load on your lower back. A rack pull is more like a hip thrust, meets thigh exercise, meets upper back and trap exercise? ￼ Another very simple one is the Atlas lift, once again, you don’t have to squat all the way down. You just rack up the weight, like you’re doing a squad, and the only goal is to just lift it up half an inch. For the fools who say this don’t do nothing, I have like the most insanely jacked legs thighs calves quads of all time and once again I’m not on steroids. It don’t matter if they are vegan plant-based, professional or whatever, everyone is on steroids! Even your favorite vegan power lifter and weightlifter is on steroids! Even your favorite yoga instructor or calisthenics or CrossFit instructor is also on steroids. Note, steroids are vegan! Ha ha. My massage therapist Aaron at massage envy in Beverly Hills, 100% recommended, told me something interesting that all body mechanics are pretty much the same, but the only difference is our levels of fitness. Also he encouraged me that because I am so physically active, to once again, the more physically active you become, the more time you must also dedicate to stretching mobility work etc. As an investor, you need to have big balls and high testosterone, good mood, good sleep, good physiological and mental health. The primary issue is that a lot of these degenerate traders, have very very poor physical and physiological health. If you’re checking prices like 100 times a day, this is bad. I would actually make the argument if you’re like a single person, and assuming that you’re trading bitcoin and investing a micro strategy stock whatever, the intelligence strategy is if you want to get your mind off things, invest in your physical fitness and health 10x. What that then means is like spend maximum time outside, outdoors, walking outside in the elements, go on nice hikes, be a nature, spend some time with the gym or weightlifting at home, essentially embrace a natural lifestyle. Also, quit marijuana, alcohol. These are all bad toxins. Just be sober. When in Doubt, Buy More Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Fund manager Stephen Yiu of Blue Whale Growth Fund has forecasted that Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) will yield substantial returns for investors by 2025, potentially surpassing AI chip heavyweight Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). What Happened: Yiu said that tech giants like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google LLC (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are looking to broaden their AI chip supplier base. Despite their substantial purchases of Nvidia’s GPUs, these companies are now also creating their own custom chips for AI applications, CNBC reported on Monday. Don’t Miss: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast — here’s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate. Warren Buffett once said, "If you don't find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die." These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. Yiu sees Broadcom as the next Nvidia in terms of potential outperformance, thanks to its strong partnerships with major tech firms. “Nvidia's GPUs are very powerful, but at the same time also very expensive,” Yiu noted. “From Microsoft's perspective, you don't want to become overly dependent on one single supplier.” Broadcom’s year to date returns have climbed 103.42% this year, as of Monday pre-market hours, according to Benzinga Pro. It hit a market cap of over $1 trillion after announcing that its AI revenue tripled to $12.2 billion in 2024. The company is working with three major cloud computing customers, Meta, Alphabet, and ByteDance, to develop custom AI chips. Despite still holding an investment in Nvidia, Yiu has significantly cut it from nearly 10% of his fund's portfolio. He views Broadcom as a more attractive investment opportunity due to its smaller size. “For a $1 trillion company to grow 50% to become $1.5 trillion is reasonable. But for Nvidia to do that, they would need to add another $1.5 trillion, which is a very big number,” he elaborated. Trending: Arrived Home's Private Credit Fund’s has historically paid an annualized dividend yield of 8.1%*, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with just a $100 minimum. Why It Matters: Broadcom’s CEO Hock Tan has expressed strong confidence in the sustainability of the AI boom. Big tech companies like Google, Meta, and ByteDance are investing heavily in designing custom processors to accelerate the training and deployment of AI systems. Even OpenAI and Apple have partnered with Broadcom to develop their AI server chips, diversifying their exposure to Nvidia. Kurv Investment Management’s CEO Howard Chan recently mentioned that chipmakers like Nvidia and Broadcom are leading the AI wave. He noted that demand is outstripping supply in this sector, benefiting chipmakers and cloud computing service providers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), known for her active stock market investments as a member of Congress, disclosed in June that she had acquired call options on Broadcom. These options, adjusted to a strike price of $80 after a 10-for-1 stock split, are set to expire in June 2025. Pelosi, a widely followed Congressional trader, has drawn significant attention to her stock holdings, inspiring dedicated Pelosi portfolio trackers. Check It Out: EquityMultiple's ‘Alpine Note — Basecamp Series' is turning heads and opening wallets. This short-term note investment offers investors a 9% rate of return (APY) with just a 3 month term and $5K minimum. The Basecamp rate is at a significant spread to t-bills. This healthy rate of return won't last long. With the Fed poised to cut interest rates in the near future, now could be the time to lock in a favorable rate of return with a flexible, relatively liquid investment option. What's more, Alpine Note — Basecamp can be rolled into another Alpine Note for compounding returns, or into another of EquityMultiple's rigorously vetted real estate investments, which also carry a minimum investment of just $5K.

Title: Nvidia dominated 2024 big-time. Next year? Plenty of challenges.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Apple Nears $4 Trillion Valuation, Surges Past Nvidia, Microsoft. Here's Why

Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia and Microsoft in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16 percent jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion (roughly Rs. 42,59,194 crore) to its market capitalisation. The latest rally in Apple shares reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion (roughly Rs. 3,27,95,962 crore) as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first US company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800 percent over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if US President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10 percent on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion (roughly Rs. 3,40,73,552 crore) market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments. © Thomson Reuters 2024 (This story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)

Mega automobile mergerNissan and Honda have begun official merger discussions, the two companies announced on Monday. Negotiations will end June 2025. Japan-listed Honda shares were last up 13.4% on Tuesday and on track for their best day since October 2008, after the company announced plans to buy back 24% of its issued shares by Dec. 23 next year. Taiwan tops Asian marketsAs of Dec. 23, Taiwan's Taiex had gained 28.85%, making it the best-performing stock market in Asia-Pacific in 2024. The Taiex's focus on tech and tech-related stocks helped supercharge its performance. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company soared 82.12% in 2024, and Foxconn — which trades as Hon Hai Precision Industry — advanced 77.51%. Positive start to holidaysU.S. markets rose on Monday on the back of a strong showing by large tech stocks. The New York Stock Exchange closes early Tuesday for Christmas Eve. Asia-Pacific stocks traded mixed on Tuesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped roughly 0.4% even as Honda shares popped. Meanwhile, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed more than 1%. UK GDP not OKThe U.K. economy failed to expand in the three months ending September, according to revised figure from the Office for National Statistics, published Monday. Previous estimates had pegged third-quarter gross domestic product at 0.1%. Earlier this month, data from the ONS showed the U.K. economy had unexpectedly contracted by 0.1% in October. [PRO] Buffett's biggest war chestWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding $325 billion in cash — the largest amount it's hoarded in absolute terms. Cash now comprises around 30% of Berkshire's total assets, the highest proportion in 34 years, according to data from Oppenheimer. Buffett sold large quantities of Apple and Bank of America shares this year. Why is the 94-year-old legendary investor holding on to so much cash? Analysts weigh in. U.S. markets began the trading week in holiday cheer. The S&P 500 gained 0.73% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, recovering from earlier losses, ticked up 0.16%. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.98% on the back of strong performances from large tech firms such as Nvidia, Tesla and Meta Platforms. However, shares of bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy slumped 8.8% on its first day in the Nasdaq-100 index, following the cryptocurrency's price falling to below $93,000 on Monday. That said, MicroStrategy is still among the best-performing U.S. tech companies valued at $5 billion or more, according to FactSet data. Its shares have rocketed 426% so far this year, mostly thanks to the company's stockpile of bitcoins, which it started to amass in 2020. With the rally in bitcoin following Donald Trump's election victory, MicroStrategy's bitcoin holding is now worth around $42 billion. It's the basis for the company's market capitalization ballooning to $82 billion from roughly $1.1 billion from the time it began buying bitcoin in bulk. Investors looking to ride on MicroStrategy's explosive rise should remember that the company's share price is currently trading on the back of bitcoin prices. The flipside of it is that if bitcoin prices crater for any reason — volatile as cryptocurrency can be — MicroStrategy shares may stumble too. Trading is likely to be thin this week. Markets in the U.S. will close early on Tuesday and take a break on Wednesday for Christmas Day. But light trading doesn't mean small moves in markets. "With the market's primary uptrends still intact, we are not giving up on the potential for a Santa Claus to come to Broad & Wall this year," Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, said in a note. As investors celebrate the festivities — and the S&P's 25.25% year-to-date pop — they might find an extra present underneath the tree. — CNBC's Yun Li, MacKenzie Sigalos and Ari Levy contributed to this report.

Title: US stock futures steady after tech rally pushes Wall street higher

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 closed higher Tuesday in thin trading ahead of the Christmas holiday, as tech stocks continued their strong start to the week. At 1:00 p.m. ET (18:00 GMT), both S&P 500 rose 1.1%, the Nasdaq 100 added 1.4%, while Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.9%, or 350 points. The New York Stock Exchange is set to close early Tuesday for Christmas Eve, and the market is shut on Christmas Day. Tech added to its strong start to the week as the so-called Mag 7 including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet Inc Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) climbed, though NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) traded flat. Chip stocks, which racked up stocks gains a day earlier, were marginally higher Biden after the Biden administration launched a new trade investigation into Chinese-made legacy chips, which could elad to fresh tariffs on Chinese semiconductors. American Airlines Group (NASDAQ:AAL) shares were flat recovering intraday loss Tuesday as the airline briefly grounded all flights in the U.S. due to a "technical issue." The ground stop was later lifted. Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) slipped, halting its recovery from a recent plunge that was triggered by results from a late-stage study of its weight loss drug that fell of expectations. BofA Securities stated its clients continued to buy US equities for the seventh straight week. Specifically, inflows reached $10 billion – the second-largest amount since 2008 and the biggest since January 2017. Similar to recent weeks, purchases were spread across both individual stocks and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), with stronger inflows directed toward single stocks. Large-cap stocks saw the bulk of the buying activity, while small caps experienced more subdued inflows. Institutional and retail investors increased their equity holdings for another week – the third for institutions and the second for retail clients. In contrast, hedge funds were net sellers for the second consecutive week. The rolling four-week average of inflows from institutional clients hit its highest point in nine months, reflecting a typical pattern of renewed buying activity following October’s tax-loss selling by mutual funds. “Private clients typically are big sellers in December amid tax loss selling vs. big net buyers in January. While this group has been a buyer of ETFs this month, it has sold single stocks, though slightly less so than in the average December,” BofA strategists led by Jill Carey Hall noted.

Title: Financial Market Volatility: Blame The Fed
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/23/financial-market-volatility-blame-the-fed/
Time Published: 2024-12-23T22:41:12Z
Full Content:
Despite the highly anticipated 25 basis point (0.25 percentage point) reduction in the Fed Funds Rate announced by the Fed on Wednesday, financial markets tanked.[1] The reason: the “dot plot,” the graph of the individual Federal Open Market Committee members’ (there are 19 of them) anticipated future rate levels showed only a half-percentage point (50 basis point) drop in the Fed Funds Rate (to 4.00%-4.25%) by the end of next year (2025).[1] At the September meeting, that “dot plot” showed a full percentage point drop (to 3.50%-3.75%). As a result, on Wednesday, stock prices tanked (the Dow off -1123 points (a -2.6% drop in one day), the S&P 500 fell -2.9%, the Nasdaq -3.6%, and the small cap Russell 2000, -4.4%). On Friday, the PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditure) Index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, rose only +0.1% at both the headline and core levels.[6] That eased market angst and sent equity markets up by 1.4%. For the week, the major indexes were down about -2.0%, with the small-cap Russell 2000 off more than -4%. For the month of December, the Dow was off -4.6%, the S&P 500 –1.7%, the Russell 2000 -7.5%. Only Nasdaq had a positive reading (+1.8%).[7] Equity Markets On the bond side, rates rose swiftly on Wednesday. They had been rising since late September when the 10-Year Treasury was flirting with 3.6%. 10 Year Treasury Yield On Thursday (December 19th) that 10-Year T-Note closed at 4.57%, the highest yield since late May. After today’s PCE report, it has retreated slightly to 4.53%. The Nasdaq has been the market leader all year, mainly because of the performance of the Magnificent 7 stocks.[8] Magnificent 7 On Wednesday, December 11th, META hit a record high; as of the close of business on Friday, it is down -7.5% from that record high. This past Monday (December 16th), AMZN, and GOOG both hit record highs. APPL closed at a new record high on Friday, but AMZN and GOOG are off their peaks by -3.4% and -2.6% respectively. We are often asked if a market correction is near. No one knows when such an event might occur. What we do know is that, based on market history, a correction is long overdue. All the historical market metrics, like the PE ratio (at 23x) are two standard deviations above their historical norms. For the PE ratio, the historical norm is closer to 17x. Based on that, a -25% correction would just take the markets back to its historic norm.[3] The Fed revised its interest rate view significantly at its December meeting. The reason: stubborn inflation. That view likely changed again on Friday with the PCE number being so light. In the last couple of months, the disinflation that we had been seeing looked like it had stopped. The Fed, which had switched its focus from its inflation mandate to its full employment mandate, became worried that it was no longer on the path to its 2% inflation goal. On the other hand, we see a lot of market data that says the Fed has already achieved that 2% goal. Apparently, the FOMC doesn’t want to prematurely declare victory at the risk of another inflation flare-up. After all, they were burned several year ago when they said the inflation was “transitory.” The Fed’s work is actually done by the bond market. Since the CPI and PPI releases on December 11th and 12th, the 10-Year Treasury Note yield, which was 4.15% in early December, rose to 4.57% on Thursday (December 19th) with the last 20 basis points coming since the Fed meeting on Wednesday (December 18th). As of Friday (December 20th), the 10-Year Treasury closed at a yield of 4.53%.[4] The first data point here is the BLS’s benchmark revision to the employment data for the year ended March 31st. It was a staggering downward revision of -818K jobs, that’s -68K per month. That means that all those job market “beats” that has kept the equity market buoyant were actually “misses.” And it means that the labor market is much more fragile than the Fed currently thinks and is a major reason why our view is that there will be more rate cuts in 2025 than is currently embodied in the “dot plots.” If that is the case, bond yields will be much lower (bond prices much higher) than the market has currently priced in.[5] It is also quite likely that in next year’s benchmark revisions, we will see negative numbers emerge in Q2, Q3, and Q4 of 2024. The Fed was correct to have placed emphasis on their full-employment mandate in September; why they switched back to their inflation mandate is truly puzzling. Perhaps they felt that the pause in September and October’s disinflation readings was something they had to address. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released a week ago Wednesday (December 11th) and the PPI the next day. The headline CPI rose +0.3% in November from October’s level and is up +2.7% from a year earlier. This was a disappointment because the year/year inflation rate rose to +2.7% from +2.6% in October. While the Fed doesn’t use the CPI, per se, it does have an influence. The “core” rate of inflation (ex-food and energy) also rose +0.3% in November, and its year/year rate disappointingly held steady at a too high +3.3%. Consumer Prices (CPI) The headline Producer Price Index (PPI) also disappointed, coming in at a +0.4% in November, mostly due to a large rise in wholesale food prices. (Note that these rising food prices get translated pretty quickly to the consumer level and will likely show up in the CPI in the next month.) Markets expected only +0.2%, so the rise was double the expectation. If we take out the food prices, the rise was a tamer +0.2%, i.e., what the market expected. Note that Services prices, which has been driving the inflation lately, rose only +0.2%, the smallest gain since July. So that’s a positive. Another such positive is that Core PPI (the headline ex-food, energy, and trade services) did print +0.1% (market expected +0.2%). Producer Prices (PPI) What is so confusing about the Fed’s new attitude is that if we calculated the November CPI the way the Europeans calculate their CPI (the HICP method), November would show up as 0.0% from October, and 2.0% on the nose year/year, dead on the Fed’s inflation goal. Again, we are puzzled as to why the Fed has become so hawkish and is another reason why we believe that 2025 will have more than two rate cuts. We think there will be four to six cuts amounting to 100 to 150 basis points, bringing the Fed Funds Rate to the 3% to 3.5% range. Note that 3% is the Fed’s view of neutral – so if the economy weakens and there is a threat of Recession, the Fed will go to at least “neutral,” and most likely lower. Housing starts have continued on their downward path, falling -1.8% in November vs. October, and are down -14.6% on a year/year basis. By the way, market expectations were for a +2.6% increase for November, so the -1.8% was a big miss and was another reason for equity market volatility this past week. If we look at more detailed data, we find that while single-family starts rose +6.4% in November, that didn’t make up for the -9.1% fall in October’s starts. For the single-family area, starts are down -10.2% from a year ago.[6] The real action was in the multi-family space, down -23.2% in November from October’s pace. That’s the second lowest print since April 2020 (Covid). In addition, the pipeline shows that there were +780K new multi-family units under construction. The vacancy rate is already high, and it is likely going to continue to rise. The end result will be that the lower rents we’ve seen for the past year and a half will continue. Multifamily Units Under Construction The BLS uses lagged rents when it computes the CPI. We have noted in several blogs that rents have been falling for over a year.[7] So, now that those lagged rents that the BLS uses to compute the CPI have turned negative (such rents have a 35% weighting in the CPI), we expect to see much better inflation numbers going forward, another reason we see more rate cuts by the Fed that are currently priced in. Wage growth is also slowing. It was 3.8% year/year in November vs. 4.2% in October vs. 4.9% in September. Given that productivity growth is at 2%, that would put inflationary pressure from the wage side at 1.8% (that’s the 3.8% wage growth minus 2.0% productivity). That’s right in the Fed’s wheelhouse, and another reason we see more than two rate cuts in 2025. Another indicator of a softening economy is Industrial Production. It was off -0.1% in November and is down -0.9% year/year. Industrial Production has flatlined for the past year and a half and it is clear that manufacturing in the U.S. is in Recession. The only components that show any signs of life are in the tech area. Industrial Production The NY Fed’s Services Index showed up as -5.2 in December after a -0.5 print in November and has been negative for three months in a row. In the employment arena, initial claims for unemployment insurance are up and the average duration of unemployment (time between jobs) is the highest since Covid. Clearly new hiring has slowed. Yet another reason for rate reductions. Retail Sales were up a hefty +0.7% in November. The consumer is being fueled by asset growth, i.e., the stock market. According to Rosenberg Research, asset growth on consumer balance sheets was up $5 trillion in Q3 alone and it is up +10.4% from a year ago. Meanwhile, consumer liabilities have risen by a mere 3.4%. Consumer incomes have been rising too, but not nearly as much, growing at 1/8th the pace of financial assets. It appears that it is the financial asset growth that has been supporting consumption. In fact, we’ve seen a -127 billion annual rate savings drawdown in Q3, and Rosenberg notes that savings growth has been negative in four of the last five quarters. One other point: Throughout the Q3 earnings reports, the large retailers unanimously reported that the consumer is revolting against high prices. We’re not talking about the current rate of inflation, but about past inflation that has raised prices to their current high level. The consumer is looking for cheaper alternatives or is foregoing consumption altogether. Even in the buoyant Retail Sales numbers, note that November Restaurant Sales were down -0.4% vs. October, sales at the Grocery chains were off -0.2%, sales of apparel fell -0.2% (unusual for the holiday season), and Department Store sales were off -0.1%. The Fed has scared both the bond market (rates rising) and the equity market. The equity downtrend, currently in the -3% range for the week (higher for small caps) – it’s only a couple days old. Whether it becomes a trend is another issue. Markets clearly did not like the Fed’s move back to inflation fighter mode, as it is clear that disinflation will continue. The CPI and PPI disappointed for November, are the likely cause of the Fed’s return to its inflation mandate, and have contributed to the recent rise in interest rates. The main contributor to higher rates was the Fed itself as it moved away from its employment mandate and back to being the inflation doctor. It now forecasts only two rate cuts of 25 basis points each in 2025, down from four at its November meeting. Rents have been falling for more than a year and that is now set to put downward pressure on the inflation indexes, especially the CPI where rents have a 35% weight in the index. The industrial sector continues to slow and is clearly in Recession. And the unemployment data and jobs market in general are starting to cause angst. The consumer continues to spend, and it appears this has been driven by asset growth (rising stock prices) on consumer balance sheets. A long overdue stock market correction will definitely slow consumption and GDP growth. There are signs that the consumer is revolting against high prices.

Title: Global markets quiet at start of Christmas festivities

Global markets were quiet on Monday at the start of a holiday-shortened week. After a solid run since the November presidential election, Wall Street’s rally hit a bump this month, especially after the US Federal Reserve forecast just two 0.25 per cent rate reductions for 2025 – down from its September view of four cuts – and raised its annual inflation outlook. The Iseq closed down 0.18 per cent on Monday. AIB was up 1.55 per cent finishing at €5.24. Bank of Ireland dropped 0.16 per cent to €8.65. Ryanair fell 0.80 per cent to €19.10. Dalata Hotels was up 1.09 per cent to €4.63. Food supplier Kerry Group fell 0.11 per cent to €91.90 a share. Glanbia was up 0.52 per cent to €13.47. Shares in Kingspan decreased by 0.79 per cent to €69.45. Home builders Cairn Homes fell by 0.85 per cent to €2.33. Glenveagh Properties rose by 0.13 per cent to €1.59 a share. The export-oriented FTSE 100 was up 0.2 per cent after logging its worst week in more than a year on Friday. The domestically focused FTSE 250 was down 0.2 per cent. AstraZeneca rose 1.6 per cent after its lung-cancer drug was approved in the European Union, helping pharma and biotech shares lead sectoral gains with a 1.2 per cent rise. Energy companies were up 0.6 per cent after last week’s lower-than-expected U.S. inflation reading stabilised oil prices. On the flip side, industrial support services led losses with a 0.8 per cent decline. Meanwhile, official figures showed Britain’s economy failed to grow during the first three months of Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s new government, adding to signs of a slowdown that has cast a shadow over his time in office so far. Among individual stocks, Direct Line rose 3.8 per cent to the top of the mid-cap index after insurer Aviva agreed to buy the smaller rival in a 3.7 billion pound (€4.46 billion) cash-and-stock deal. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index ended the session 0.1 per cent higher. Healthcare stocks outperformed as Novo rallied, recovering from the previous session when it hit levels not seen since August 2023. European government bonds fell after European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde said policymakers remain alert to lingering price pressures in the services sector, while confident the central bank is nearing its consumer-price target. The euro-area economy will pick up less momentum next year than previously foreseen and only expand slightly more strongly than in 2024, according to a Bloomberg survey. The predictions are more downbeat than those of the ECB, which also lowered its outlook this month as it cut interest rates for the fourth time since June. The S&P 500 and the Dow fell on Monday in holiday-thinned trading after a stopgap government funding bill averted a US government shutdown and investors braced for a slower pace of rate cuts from the Federal Reserve next year. A cooler-than-expected inflation report on Friday helped U.S. stocks recoup some losses. However, overall market sentiment was still cautious, said Thierry Wizman, strategist at Macquarie. The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.27 per cent, to buoyed by gains in chipmakers and megacap stocks. Nvidia added 1.6 per cent and Meta Platforms rose 1.4 per cent. Apple’s market capitalisation stood at $3.84 trillion (€3.69 trillion) as the world’s most valuable company inched closer to the $4 trillion (€3.8 trillion) milestone. Qualcomm’s shares rose 1.7 per cent after a jury found its central processors are properly licensed under an agreement with UK-based Arm Holdings. Shares of Arm, which has vowed to seek a fresh trial, fell about 5 per cent. Walmart fell 3.3 per cent after the U.S. consumer finance watchdog accused the retail giant and workforce payments company Branch Messenger of forcing more than a million delivery drivers into using accounts that cost them more than $10 million (€9.6 million) in junk fees. Eli Lilly gained 1.7 per cent after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the drugmaker’s weight-loss treatment, Zepbound, for obstructive sleep apnoea. Shares of sleep apnoea device makers ResMed and Inspire Medical fell about 4 per cent each.

Stocks are slightly higher to start the final full trading week of the year as the dollar strengthens and oil and gold pull back. We have one big question heading into the holidays: Was Friday's double dose of good news a market turning point? 2. Bloomberg reported that Apple is looking into smart doorbell and lock devices to bolster its home security offering and better compete against Amazon's Ring and other rivals. Meanwhile, Wedbush reaffirmed its view that Apple Intelligence will bolster demand for new devices. "In our view, Apple could sell north of 240 million iPhone units in FY25 as this AI-driven upgrade cycle takes hold and this will be the highest iPhone unit sales year in Apple's history." 3. Bristol-Myers Squibb said that the European Commission has approved Opdivo plus Yervoy — two drugs that can be used in combination for treating certain kinds of cancer — for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. 4. Thousands of Amazon workers at a Staten Island warehouse walked off the job, joining the tens of thousands of employees in other states on strike to protest unfair labor practices. Meanwhile, Starbucks workers expanded their strike to New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia and St. Louis. 5. Reuters reported that President-elect Donald Trump indicated over the weekend that he might be open to some solutions to allow TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments on Jan. 10 as the social media company tries to halt a federal ban that would start on Jan. 19, one day before Trump re-enters the White House. While a ban would likely prove positive for engagement on other social media platforms offered by Meta and Alphabet, we still like those Club names even if TikTok successfully challenges the ban. 6. The Financial Times reported that Meta Platforms is looking to add displays to its line of smart glasses, possibly as soon as next year. 7. Honda and Nissan officially began merger talks, with the two signing a memorandum of understanding to consider a business integration. A second memorandum of understanding was also signed that offers Nissan's strategic partner Mitsubishi the chance to join the new company. 8. Xerox will acquire Lexmark, a Chinese-owned printer and printing software maker, in a $1.5 billion deal expected to close in the second half of 2025. 9.

Title: The AI smartphones that never materialized in 2024

By Allison Johnson, a reviewer with 10 years of experience writing about consumer tech. She has a special interest in mobile photography and telecom. Previously, she worked at DPReview. I’ve spent the past year covering every major phone launch in the US, and each one loudly declared the same thing: AI is here, and ours is the AI phone you’ve been waiting for. Each was followed by much applause and favorable stock price movement. But when I got those phones into my hands, the AI was underwhelming, to say the least. The theory is that smartphones as we know them are evolving into something new: AI smartphones. An AI smartphone will be a new kind of device that doesn’t force you to interact with a grid of apps all day long; you’ll be able to ask it to order pizza or send an email just by using an AI-imbued voice assistant. You’ll be able to point your camera at a flyer for a show, have the AI check whether you’re free, and add it to your calendar. You’ll ask it about something a friend said to you — maybe in an email or a text, you’re not sure which — and it will go find the information for you. Personally, all of the above sounds great to me. I’d love some help with the chores I carry out a hundred times a day on my phone — and with the firehose of incoming information and notifications I deal with. But AI smartphones are not here yet, not by a long shot, despite what you may have heard. Instead, what we have feels like a collection of loosely associated tech demos. Right now, AI on your phone can help you write and rewrite an email to sound more professional or react to a text with a disco pigeon emoji. There’s AI to translate phone calls, which kind of works and is actually pretty neat. And there’s AI that can turn a nice picture of food into something horrifying. AI on our phones has offered one weird trick after another: sometimes funny, sometimes interesting, but hardly the platform shift we’ve been promised. All of the major phone makers are at fault. Samsung opened the year with its Galaxy S24 launch in January, declaring “Galaxy AI is here” at a hockey arena-appropriate volume. To be sure, the devices it announced are good smartphones, and they run a blend of Samsung and Google’s Gemini Nano models on-device, but I wouldn’t call them AI smartphones. Supposedly, they can help you take distractions out of your photos — but you might end up with something even more distracting instead. The live language interpreter feature for phone calls could come in handy for something like making a dinner reservation. But it also translated a statement from my colleague as “I am eating my chair.” (She was not.) Most users will find that these AI features fade into the background once the novelty wears off. Later in 2024, fall hardware season arrived early with AI-ified Pixels. Google has made much of AI on its phones for the past couple of years, but the company’s Gemini AI is absolutely everywhere on the Pixel 9 series. There’s an AI-generated summary at the top of the weather app, a new app that saves and tags your screenshots using AI, a new AI-powered default assistant, and lots of AI image generation tools — from silly to seriously worrying. Some of it does feel useful, particularly the screenshots app, which is the kind of thing you might find handy if you tend to keep infinite Chrome tabs open on your phone as bookmarks. But these features, siloed into their respective apps, don’t feel like they have much to do with each other. Gemini sort of connects the dots with extensions, but support for different apps is being added slowly — and even with an extension, Gemini can only do so much for you. Last but not least, we met the iPhones “built for Apple Intelligence” in September. I think it says a lot about the state of Apple’s AI that the iPhone 16 initially shipped without Apple Intelligence. AI features finally arrived in late October with iOS 18.1. And if anyone was waiting with bated breath, this first update was probably underwhelming. Right now, Apple Intelligence includes summaries for notifications and emails, tools to alter the style of your writing, and a new glowing UI for Siri. Notification summaries can be useful, but usually they’re just funny. The writing tools are standard fare at this point, and Siri is basically the same old assistant with a new coat of paint. There’s more to come, but what’s here now certainly doesn’t add up to an AI smartphone. It’s not just phones; this is a messy moment for AI in general. Depending on who you ask, AI is either a massive bubble that’s about to burst or a few months away from evolving into digital God. AI is being foisted on us in every direction: surfacing in Google search results, lurking in every Meta product, greeting you by name in the Spotify app. It’s hard to separate the signal from the noise when it comes to AI, because the noise is everywhere and it’s so goddamn loud! And there really might be a signal in there — especially when it comes to our phones. Siri really might become more useful, with an Apple Intelligence update this spring that will allow it to take action in apps through something known as App Intents. Developers will be able to surface certain actions — like ordering the pizza that AI proponents keep promising — so they’re accessible at the system level by Siri. Google seems to be preparing a similar framework in Android 16, which could help bridge the gap between Gemini and individual apps without the apps needing an entire extension. And who knows? Maybe Bixby will get in the game, too. The trouble is, after a full year of supposedly game-changing AI on our mobile devices that amounted to nothing, it’s starting to sound like the phone makers are crying wolf. The real AI smartphones need to stand up pretty soon — before our collective patience starts to run out.

Title: Apple approaches $4 trillion valuation as investors bet on AI momentum

By Shashwat Chauhan and Medha Singh (Reuters) -Apple is closing in on a historic $4 trillion stock market valuation, powered by investors cheering progress in the company's long-awaited AI enhancements to rejuvenate sluggish iPhone sales. The company has pulled ahead of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the race to the monumental milestone, thanks to an about 16% jump in shares since early November that has added about $500 billion to its market capitalization. The latest rally in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL) reflects "investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and an expectation that it will result in a supercycle of iPhone upgrades," said Tom Forte, an analyst at Maxim Group, who has a "hold" rating. Valued at about $3.85 trillion as of the last close, Apple dwarfs the combined value of Germany and Switzerland's main stock markets. The Silicon Valley firm, driven by the so-called iPhone supercycles, was the first U.S. company to hit previous trillion-dollar milestones. In recent years, the company has attracted criticism for being slow to map out its artificial intelligence strategy, while Microsoft, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have pulled ahead to dominate the emerging technology. Shares of Nvidia, the biggest AI beneficiary, have surged more than 800% over the past two years, compared to the near doubling in shares of Apple during the same period. Apple earlier in December started integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its devices after unveiling plans in June to integrate generative AI technology across its app suite. The company expects overall revenue to increase "low- to mid-single digits" during its fiscal first quarter - a modest growth forecast for the holiday shopping season - sparking questions about the momentum for the iPhone 16 series. However, LSEG data showed analysts expect revenue from iPhones to rebound in 2025. "Although near-term iPhone demand is still muted ... it is a function of limited Apple Intelligence features and geographic availability, and as both broaden, it will help to drive an improvement in iPhone demand," Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Erik Woodring said in a note, reiterating Apple as the brokerage's "top pick" heading into 2025. The recent surge in shares has pushed Apple's price-to-earnings ratio to a near three-year high of 33.5, compared to 31.3 for Microsoft and 31.7 for Nvidia, according to LSEG data. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKa) has sold shares of Apple - its top holding - this year, as the conglomerate broadly retreated from equities on concerns over stretched valuations. "I suspect the stock in three years will not look as expensive as it does today," said Eric Clark, portfolio manager of the Rational (LON:0FRJ) Dynamic Brands Fund, which holds Apple shares. Apple faces the risk of retaliatory tariffs if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump delivers on his promise to slap tariffs of at least 10% on goods coming from China. "We believe it's likely Apple gets exclusions on products like iPhone, Mac and iPad, similar to the first round of China tariffs in 2018," Woodring said. Apple's shares tumbled last Wednesday amid a Wall Street selloff after the Federal Reserve forecast a slower pace of rate cuts next year but investors expect the broad trend of monetary easing to support stock markets next year. "Technology has been regarded by investors as a new form of a defensive sector because of their earnings growth," said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. The Fed's action "could end up having a greater impact on some of the other cyclical areas such as consumer discretionary and financials and less so on technology." "Apple's approach to $4 trillion market cap is a testament to its enduring dominance in the tech sector. This milestone reinforces Apple's position as a market leader and innovator," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive officer of 50 Park Investments.

The words, donned in all-caps and gray font, were a play on the Latin phrase "Aut Caesar Aut Nihil," which translates to "Either Caesar or nothing" or rather "All or nothing." It was a fitting phrase for a company that in 2024 put the full weight of its resources behind its artificial intelligence strategy. Meta in April said it would raise its spending levels in 2024 by as much as $10 billion to support infrastructure investments for its AI efforts. Although the announcement sent shares plunging as much as 19% that evening, investors have come around to the company's costly AI ambitions. Meta's stock price hit a record on Dec. 11, and it's up nearly 70% year to date as of the market's close on Friday. "It's clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there," Zuckerberg said on a call with analysts in October. He noted AI's "positive impact on nearly all aspects of our work," highlighting how the technology was key to rebuilding the company's online advertising business that took a lashing from Apple's iOS privacy update in 2021. Additionally, he said AI underpins Meta's more nascent projects, such as its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and experimental Orion augmented reality headset that Zuckerberg believes could represent "the next computing platform." Zuckerberg's comments about AI underscore how the technology has become Meta's top priority, directly impacting the company's business and potentially paving the way for future revenue opportunities. Unlike the company's more conventional services, like Instagram and Facebook, AI is an infrastructure technology that Zuckerberg wants hardwired into its various products, particularly as competitors like OpenAI continue to make inroads with consumers. While OpenAI's GPT family of AI models help power apps like ChatGPT, Meta's family of Llama AI models feeds the company's newer generative AI features like the Meta AI digital assistant. That chatbot represents Zuckerberg's primary way to introduce generative AI technologies to its billions of users. "Meta AI is on track to being the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of this year," Zuckerberg said at Connect. The company has been increasingly releasing new generative AI features for advertisers to continue improving the efficiency of its online advertising platform. And with the hiring last month of Clara Shih, who had been Salesforce's CEO of AI, to lead a new business AI group, Meta aims to build a more enterprise-focused unit in the new year. Meta's all-encompassing approach to AI has led analysts to predict that Meta is positioned for more success in 2025. Analysts at Jefferies chose Meta as one of generative AI's "winners" heading into 2025, writing in a Dec. 15 note that the company's massive user base represents "one of the richest surfaces to introduce Gen AI tools." Truist Securities analysts said in a note last week that the Meta AI digital assistant could challenge Google's search as "an answer engine for all kinds of queries" and that the social media company is likely to outperform in 2025, potentially benefiting from offering businesses more advanced customer service chatbots. "We believe META has a unique opportunity to introduce Gen AI tools to the almost 4B users & >200M businesses across its family of apps," the Jefferies analysts wrote. Meta declined to comment for this article, but pointed to previous statistics and executive comments about AI. Meta has been increasingly talking up the number of people who use Meta AI, with Zuckerberg saying in December that the digital assistant "now has nearly 600 million monthly actives." He launched the Meta AI chatbot in 2023 to rival the generative AI chatbots of competitors, most notably OpenAI's ChatGPT. In April, the company brought it to the forefront of each of the apps in its empire by putting Meta AI in the search bars of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Messenger. But because the company doesn't offer a stand-alone Meta AI app, it's difficult to directly compare its usage to similar services like ChatGPT or Anthropic's Claude, said David Curry, the data editor for insights firm Business of Apps. When it comes to monthly active users, the most popular of these generative AI chatbot apps is ChatGPT by a wide margin, followed by Google Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, Claude and Perplexity, Curry said. The Meta AI "standalone website gets less than 10 million views per month, putting it far below the major services (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc) and even lower than some mid-range players like Anthropic," Curry said, based on data he accessed via the Similarweb web-tracking service. Meta's finance chief, Susan Li, told analysts in July that India has become the company's "largest market for Meta AI usage." That usage has coincided with promising signs of retention and engagement on WhatsApp, Li added. Among those users is Sonny Ravan, a music producer in Pune, India. Ravan said he finds Meta AI, which he uses through WhatsApp, helpful for learning about the history of songs that he enjoys. He also uses it as a tool to learn about people in the music industry who he plans to work with or meet, describing it as great for preparation. Sathish Thiyagarajan, 30, a technical support engineer for marketing tech firm GoX.AI, said he's increasingly using Meta AI as a search tool via WhatsApp, which he noted dominates the Indian market for mobile internet communications. "While I'm talking with my family or my friends, if they're saying something to me and I have to search something, I'm not going to go to Google," said Thiyagarajan, of Chennai, India. "I'm just going to put the phone in the speaker mode, and I'll immediately search through Meta AI." However, Thiyagarajan said he only uses Meta AI when he's on his phone. If he's at his computer, OpenAI's ChatGPT is his preferred AI chatbot. Not everyone is a fan of Meta AI's bundling into WhatsApp's search functions. Jawhar Sircar, 72, a retired government official in Kolkata, India, called the Meta AI search feature in WhatsApp "quite a nuisance." That's because whenever a user pauses while typing out a name in the search-find box, the Meta AI technology quickly "picks up whatever has been typed" and generates what he describes as unnecessary search prompt suggestions. As far as the popularity of Meta AI in India, Sircar said he thinks the feature is mostly used by companies, technologists and other professionals who "are getting hooked to AI" alongside the Indian government's continued investment in regional computing infrastructure. "Professionals and companies have started using AI, but the general user has no need, at least not on the Meta platforms," Sircar wrote in an email. Advertising is still the key to revenue. Meta said in December that over 1 million advertisers had used the company's GenAI tools to create more than 15 million ads in a single month. "We estimate that businesses using image generation are seeing a +7% increase in conversions," Meta said at the time, regarding its image generation features. While people may associate generative AI with the visually striking and sometimes surreal imagery derived from popular services like Dall-E or Midjourney, it's more likely that the average small business advertiser uses Meta's GenAI tools for more subtle tasks, said Stacy Reed, an online advertising and Facebook ads consultant. That includes using AI to create multiple versions of an ad's headline, auto-resizing the size of ads so they look appropriate within users' Instagram and Facebook apps, and repositioning certain images within the ads so that the promotions perform better, Reed said. Advertisers that already write strong, creative copy can ask Meta's GenAI tools for "a little bit more" help, Reed said. "That's where you win with their AI tools," she said. Reed said the many small advertisers she supports aren't associating the new features with AI. They "think that Meta is just enhancing the way you build ads," Reed said. Celina Guerrero, an independent corporate sales and training consultant, said she uses Meta's GenAI tools to help with writing headlines for her ads, but she said she finds Meta's advertising interface to be confusing and constantly changing. "It is visually overwhelming from a user experience," Guerrero said. Ahead of a Facebook ad campaign planned for January, Guerrero said she is debating how to use Meta's GenAI tools for more in-depth tasks, like modifying her ad's entire in-line copy. "I don't want my copy to sound like ChatGPT," Guerrero said, referring to the sterile, run-of-the-mill AI-generated text that's proliferating the web. "I have two options: One, I don't use the variations, or two, I spend an inordinate amount of hours editing it." Most big companies and advertising agencies are turning to more marketing-specific tools for their generative AI-based ad campaigns, said Jay Pattisall, principal analyst at Forrester. Those services are more robust than Meta's built-in AI ad tools, he said. Still, the mere introduction of simple GenAI tools is beneficial to Meta considering it dominates the digital ads market along with Google. Meta's generative AI tools just have "to be good enough to squeeze out more investment" from advertisers, said Maurice Rahmey, CEO of performance marketing firm Disruptive Digital and a former Facebook customer manager. "It's better for their business, even if it's just those small, incremental changes," Rahmey said "It's a business of scale." With Meta's hiring of Shih from Salesforce in November, some analysts say Meta could make an enterprise technology push with its Llama family of open-source AI models. Llama's advancements "represent a significant opportunity for businesses to drive more efficiencies and significantly improve the experiences they offer their customers," Meta monetization head John Hegeman said in a statement. Shih, who was one of CNBC's 2024 changemakers, rejoined Salesforce in 2020 after previously working at the company from 2006 through 2009. As part of her most recent role at Salesforce, Shih helped oversee Einstein GPT for Service and Sales, a GenAI product intended for sales and customer support staff. During her first stint at Salesforce, Shih created a business app that let users connect their Salesforce customer relationship software with their Facebook connections. In 2009, she wrote "The Facebook Era," a book intended for professionals to better understand how to use social networks for business. Multiple former Meta AI and product leaders told CNBC that Shih's vast experience will be helpful considering the company has failed in previous attempts at building enterprise software. Meta announced in May that it plans to shut down Workplace, its business communications product, by 2026. And after buying enterprise startup Kustomer for about $1 billion in 2020, Meta spun it out in 2023 in a deal that was reportedly valued at $250 million. The most logical step for Meta would be to create a larger business around WhatsApp, said Ralph Schackart, an internet equity analyst at investment bank William Blair. Specifically, WhatsApp could help businesses build customer-service chatbots using Meta's GenAI, Schackart said. "Longer term, this is going to evolve into customized sales agents, which is a $3 trillion-plus industry," Schackart said about Meta's WhatsApp business AI chatbot opportunity.

Title: The Lonely Skepticism of a Bull-Market Skeptic

As investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, and lately for a Trump Presidency, has been driving the stock market to record highs this year, Jeremy Grantham has been having flashbacks. At the end of the nineteen-nineties, the veteran value investor—one that looks for undervalued stocks—shied away from soaring Internet and technology stocks, believing that their prices had departed from financial reality, and that the market was heading for a crash. Far from thanking him for sounding the alarm, many clients of G.M.O., a Boston-based investment-management firm that Grantham had co-founded, held it responsible for making them miss out on a vertiginous rise in the Nasdaq, which went up by about a hundred and sixty per cent between 1998 and 1999. Some withdrew their money from the company. “We started off in a good position, and in two years we lost almost half of our business,” Grantham recalled. “The clients treated us as if we’d done it deliberately. It was a near-catastrophe.” Fortunately for Grantham, his skepticism eventually proved well founded. In March, 2000, the dot-com bubble finally burst, and during the subsequent eighteen months the Nasdaq plunged about seventy per cent, inflicting huge losses on those who had got in near the market top. G.M.O.’s investments, which were positioned for the fall, actually made money during this torrid period, and the firm attracted a lot of new clients. “Suddenly, we were superheroes, and the whole thing turned out fine,” Grantham said. “But that was only possible because I was the boss, and I was putting a lot of pressure on people to double down.” A quarter of a century on, Grantham finds himself in a familiar position as a lonely bear in a market that he regards as a speculative bubble, but which so far has stubbornly defied his predictions of doom. In March of last year, he said that the S. & P. 500 could plunge by fifty per cent: since then, the index has risen by about that much. For this year, despite a tumble last week after the Federal Reserve indicated it will be cautious in cutting interest rates in 2025, the S. & P. 500 is up around twenty-four per cent, and the tech-laden Nasdaq is up nearly thirty-two per cent. Stock in Nvidia, which makes chips that are widely used in large-language A.I. models, has risen roughly a hundred and seventy per cent, and since October, 2022, the month before ChatGPT was released, it’s up tenfold. The firm now has a market capitalization of $3.2 trillion. Grantham is unchastened. These days, he has retired from day-to-day portfolio management. At G.M.O., he holds the title “long-term investment strategist,” and he is at pains to point out that he doesn’t speak for the firm. But when he called me the other morning from Mexico, where he had just arrived on a vacation, he expressed deep skepticism about an environment that has prompted many of his fellow-bears to recant. In an interview with Bloomberg earlier this month, Nouriel Roubini, an economist whose warnings before the financial crisis of 2008 earned him the nickname “Dr. Doom,” declared, “I would say I am not Dr. Doom: I am Dr. Realist.” Roubini, pointing to the impact of A.I. and other technological innovations, went on: “There are plenty of upsides in economic growth.” Another seasoned skeptic, David Rosenberg, of Rosenberg Research, posted an article on LinkedIn, “Lament of a Bear,” in which he wrote, “I have gained a greater appreciation that it is going to take a whole lot to upset this apple cart.” If there was a modest market correction in the near future, Rosenberg added, his inclination would be to “buy that dip.” Grantham said that he wasn’t surprised in the least to see some erstwhile bears now making optimistic noises. “The longer the bubble lasts, the more people have to throw in the towel for self-preservation reasons,” he said. “In general, in finance, opposing a bubble is not a survival strategy.” During the dot-com boom, many bearish voices on Wall Street fell silent, and some left their jobs, as their firms sought to profit from the boom by promoting or investing in Internet and tech stocks. In such situations, Grantham said, the competitive pressures and financial incentives to join the crowd can be overpowering. He also cited the real-estate bubble in the years leading up to 2007, when many big banks plunged into the business of cobbling together subprime-mortgage securities, only to get stuck with some of them on their balance sheets when the bubble burst and the securities became practically worthless. Initially, some of the banks had shied away from subprime, which involves lending to high-risk borrowers, but when they saw their competitors generating hefty profits, they felt obliged to join in. In a famous July, 2007, interview with the Financial Times, Chuck Prince, the chief executive of Citigroup, one of the firms that was subsequently bailed out by taxpayers, said, “As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing.” After reminding me of this quote, Grantham commended Prince, kind of. “He got his timing wrong, but at least he was being honest,” Grantham said. That’s not to say, of course, that at least some of the analysts and investors who are still recommending (or buying) stock in such tech giants as Nvidia, Microsoft (up nearly a hundred per cent since October, 2022), Google (up more than a hundred and twenty-five per cent), and Meta (up more than five hundred per cent) don’t genuinely believe that A.I. will enable these firms, and others, to make much larger profits in the years ahead. Nvidia, for one, is already benefitting hugely from the boom. This past month, it reported net profits of $19.3 billion for its latest quarter, on revenues of thirty-five billion. On a year-over-year basis, its revenues and profits were both up by more than ninety per cent. Grantham can’t argue with these figures, obviously, and he doesn’t dispute the assessment that A.I. is a potentially transformative technology. Indeed, he agrees that it is. But he insisted that this doesn’t alter his view that the stock market is in a bubble, a judgment he said was based on his study of history as well as his own experiences. He pointed to elevated market-wide measures of valuation, such as the price-to-earnings ratio, that is the relationship of stock prices relative to corporate earnings. A rise in the P-E ratio indicates that stock prices are growing faster than earnings—a time-tested warning sign for bears like Grantham. Citing the work of his friend Edward Chancellor, a British financial historian, he also noted that the technology-based financial optimism prevalent on Wall Street has been characteristic of many speculative episodes, including the development of canals in England and railroads in the United States. “The more people believe that the technology is utterly transformative, and the more right they are, the more colossal the bubble becomes,” Grantham said. “Because the technology is so important, and is understood to be so important, it sucks in every last single dollar. And of course, A.I., in that sense, is the real McCoy.” Since November 6th, Trump’s election has only added to the euphoria on Wall Street, where many investors think that tax cuts and deregulation will prove to be another plus for the stock market. Grantham said that he hasn’t yet fully digested Trump’s election, but he regards it as a secondary factor in the market next to the A.I. frenzy, which he dated to the launch of ChatGPT, in November, 2022. During the preceding months, stocks had been falling, following the post-pandemic meme-stock phenomenon in 2021, but they were still highly valued relative to past experience. Grantham said that there is no historical precedent for a new bubble starting when stock prices were already so elevated. That sounded like yet another risk factor. But Grantham, despite his reputation as an überbear, isn’t predicting an immediate crash. Before he hung up and went to get his breakfast, I asked him about the takeaway from his analysis. “My attitude is ‘Watch your ass,’ ” he replied. “But can it go on for another year, to ruin any value investor who tries to oppose it? Absolutely it can.” ♦

Title: Compulsion No, Opportunity Yes in the Delaware Law of Externalities
URL: https://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2024/12/23/compulsion-no-opportunity-yes-in-the-delaware-law-of-externalities/

One distinctive feature of the U.S. economy over recent decades has been the rise of the entrepreneur-dominated public company. This development has derived largely from the growth of private funding available through venture capital, so that initial public offerings have commonly served as a “harvesting” moment for the venture capital investors rather than a fund-raising vehicle that would dilute the entrepreneur’s control position. Moreover, the success of the Google IPO in 2004 provided market validation for the entrepreneur’s use of dual class common stock as a way of retaining control while retaining considerably less than 50 percent of the cash flow rights of the public company. The entrepreneur’s “idiosyncratic vision” has also received its celebration in the academic world.[1] We commonly think of corporate law and governance as focused on managerial agency costs, given management’s self-interest and the monitoring challenges faced by diffuse public shareholders. These concerns feature most prominently in the fiduciary duty doctrines that address defensive measures against an unsolicited takeover offer or a control contest through the proxy system. Controlling entrepreneurs present a quite different set of challenges for corporate law and governance. Controllers may limit managerial agency costs, but their self-interest produces so-called controlling shareholder agency costs.[2] Alongside the rise of a new class of controllers has been a fundamental change in capital markets: the rise of portfolio investing, whether through asset managers or self-help portfolio construction, that captures the insight that investors can achieve higher risk-adjusted returns through a strategy of diversification that smooths out firm-specific risk.[3] A specialized financial intermediary, the asset manager, has exploded in significance.[4] These capital market developments came to the Delaware courts this year in a way that produced a series of unusually important cases: In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig.[5] arguably expanded the range of controller-driven transactions that require heightened procedural measures to achieve business judgment rule protection; Tornetta v. Musk[6] looked beyond a bright-line test of equity ownership percentage in deciding whether a CEO had “control;” and W. Palm Beach Fire Fighter’ Pension Fund v. Moelis & Co.[7] held that control-shifting shareholder agreements were inconsistent with board-centric provisions of Delaware law. Moelis was subsequently overruled by legislative amendment.[8] Finally there was McRitchie v. Zuckerberg,[9] holding that a company’s board and officers are not obligated as a matter of fiduciary duty to pursue a strategy that would accommodate the purported interests of the company’s shareholder majority of fully diversified investors (“portfolio investors”) in reducing externalities but rather should pursue a “single firm” or “firm-specific” strategy. This outcome is hardly a surprise, but the broad phrasing of the opinion casts some unwonted shade on the also axiomatic obverse proposition – that a board may, shielded by the business judgment rule, take account of the interests and desires of the dominant portfolio investors in pursuing a business strategy. It is directors’ discretion shielded by the business judgment rule but subject to the legitimating acquiescence of shareholders that is Delaware’s gift to the current debate over corporate behavior. As a bonus, although rejecting compulsion by judicial fiat, the court sketches explicit private-ordering routes under Delaware law to compel management of the firm, as a fiduciary duty matter, in light of the interests of fully diversified investors. The opinion includes a cautionary reflection on the limits of corporate law, at least the law of a single small state, as a lever for the pursuit of pro-social objectives. This is the recent case that I think offers the deepest dive into the possibilities and limits of Delaware corporate law. Compliments must be paid to the cleverness of the McRitchie complaint in two respects. First, it argues that the traditional framing of the directors’ duties in terms of “the corporation and its shareholders” means that at least in cases where the shareholder majority is fully diversified portfolio investors, the directors and officers need to manage by taking account of those shareholders’ portfolio interests. Second, because the directors and officers and controlling shareholder have concentrated investments in the specific firm – here Meta—their interests conflict with the interests of the portfolio investors, and thus they bear the burden of showing “entire fairness” in their chosen strategy. The court rejects plaintiff’s first move as a kind of a pun. “The corporation and its shareholders” necessarily refer to shareholders in the single firm model, and no one would think otherwise, much as a fish has no concept of an environment other than “water.”[10] The court handles plaintiff’s second move with a jujitsu sidestep, arguing that the equity interests held by Zuckerberg, the officers and the directors actually align their interests with their fiduciary duties as seen from the firm-specific perspective. But of course there is a conflict, as there is with virtually every situation of a controller, who directly or indirectly will extract some private benefits of control. A permissible level of private benefit extraction is explicitly and implicitly allowed in the cases. Explicit private benefit extraction is at the core of the seminal case of Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien,[11] in which the Sinclair parent used its control over its partially owned Venezuelan subsidiary Sinven to produce a dividend payout of virtually all Sinven’s profits, which had the effect of denying Sinven the freedom to pursue energy opportunities outside of Venezuela. Because the dividends were paid out pro rata – one share, one dollar – the Delaware Supreme Court held that the dividend payout decision was not “self-dealing” and was subject to permissive business judgment review. By contrast, the cancelling of a contractual obligation owed by Sinclair to Sinven – which would have resulted in disparate pecuniary treatment – was self-dealing and thus triggered “entire fairness” review. It is of course plain that in resolving the conflict of interest between the controller and the public minority shareholders, the court rejected the “firm specific” test. The dividend payout did not maximize Sinven’s value as a public company. Nor as a normative matter should this necessarily trouble us. As Gilson and Gordon (2003) argue, this deviation in favor of the controller reflects an allowable level of private benefits that would compensate the (undiversified) controller for extra risk-bearing while providing a benefit to the public (diversified) shareholders in the control of managerial agency costs.[12] Implicit private benefit extraction is at the core of Mendel v. Carroll.[13] The controlling Carroll family made a take-private proposal for Katy Industries at a price negotiated with the special committee of $25.75 per share, thus presumably triggering the board’s Revlon duty to obtain the highest value for shareholders. Overbidders arrived. The Pensler-Steinhardt group offered $27.80 per share for all shares and asked for an option exercisable at the deal price that would enable it to prevail over the expected opposition of the Carroll family. The Carroll family withdrew its proposal, and the court refused to order the board to grant the dilutive option. Chancellor Allen decided against granting the injunction on the ground that the Carroll family simply valued its control block at more than $25.75 a share. Perhaps the family had private information about the value of the firm, but this presumably would have been elicited in the special committee’s scrutiny of the initial take-private offer. Instead, the family valued the pecuniary and non-pecuniary private benefits of control by more than the offered price.[14] In short, we are far from assuming there is no conflict between controllers and public shareholders just because the controller owns shares. Moreover, validating the controller’s utility function would not necessarily produce the highest value from a firm-specific perspective. [15] Maybe we can put aside the controller cases on the ground that the conflicting shareholder interests in these cases are still about allocation of the pecuniary and non-pecuniary elements flowing from the specific firm and not about increasing the value of other investments of the controller. But this doesn’t do justice to the objection. Sinclair wanted the dividends from Sinven precisely because it wanted to make investments elsewhere in its portfolio of opportunities. Controllers commonly control dividend payouts (or stock repurchases) with the rest of their portfolio in mind. Thus the controller cases show us that the court is incorrect about the incentive alignment of the controller’s stock ownership and also about the demands of a single-firm approach. But those cases show that the plaintiff is wrong too. The corporate world is filled with cases in which controllers bring a multi-dimensional objective function to the operation of the firm, but those decisions are routinely thought of as presenting business-judgment-rule questions only, assuming no blatant skewing of pecuniary payouts.[16] The court cites many cases of different scenarios that employ specific-firm rhetoric, more obviously prioritizing the interests of shareholders over stakeholders (as in Revlon) but implicitly seeming to rule out consideration of the shareholders’ other investments. As a doctrinal matter, this may be mechanically accurate but functionally wrong. Let’s take the easiest case, the forms of corporate governance. Firms typically adopt governance attributes (e.g., single class board; annual say-on-pay; various board committees and leadership structure) because these are regarded as “best practices” by fully diversified shareholders looking to maximize performance across a portfolio of firms without the costly work that would be required for firm-specific tailoring.[17] Boards commonly acquiesce to such shareholder preferences even when they subjectively believe that alternative arrangements would be superior on a single-firm basis. More fundamentally, firms pick their business strategies to accommodate the interests of shareholders who they know are diversified portfolio investors. This is how I have developed the point previously: We have also accepted without question allowing the risk preferences of diversified investors to shape our theory of optimal firm structure in a way that has firm-specific consequences.[18] Diversification at the portfolio level means that such shareholders disfavor diversification at the firm level, biasing the firm against conglomeration and other diversification measures that may reduce the financial distress risk at the own-firm level and may thus increase costs for the undiversified shareholders. Diversified investors encourage risk taking at the firm level to maximize own-firm expected returns, despite the greater own-firm solvency risks, on the view that this strategy will increase expected returns across the portfolio. As part of this approach to risk, diversified investors push for cash distributions despite the increased own-firm risks. Portfolio investors are not mere kibitzers with talking points; their support is a crucial factor in the success of hedge fund activists who commonly push these strategies on target firms.[19] The say-on-pay mechanism is another vehicle by which portfolio investors promote the pursuit of a particular strategy of maximization. These theoretical understandings do not obligate the directors or officers as a matter of fiduciary duty to follow (or avoid) particular business strategies in their management of the firm, but the observed pattern of M&A activity (including divestitures) shows how directors and officers have chosen to accommodate the objectives of portfolio investors. Inevitably there will be a conflict between the interests of diversified and undiversified investors on this dimension. It turns out that a portfolio approach is embedded at the core of ‘shareholder wealth maximization,” as it is commonly understood, in light of how portfolio theory is critically involved in stock price formation.[20]Modern Portfolio Theory holds that investors are compensated for bearing risk, but only for risk that cannot be diversified away.[21] This is operationalized through specific pricing models like the well-known “Capital Asset Pricing Model” (“CAPM”). Thus market prices of specific securities are set on the assumption that investors are holding such shares in a well-diversified portfolio. Firms trying to “maximize shareholder value” will avoid unrelated diversification, the effect of which may be to reduce own-firm risk but at cost of local inefficiencies in managing a conglomerate enterprise, resulting in a stock price penalty. This follows from a price formation process that assumes idiosyncratic risk can be substantially eliminated through portfolio diversification. More generally, when managers are trying to “maximize shareholder value” for a widely held public company they cannot escape the portfolio structure of share ownership and will almost invariably be acting at the behest of portfolio investors. In short, what may serve the interests of portfolio investors will often disserve the interests of the undiversified. In this important respect, there is no such thing as a “single firm focus.”[22] Rather, at most it is what could be described as a “single firm focus constrained by awareness that the majoritarian shareholders are portfolio investors and their interests are best served by a firm strategy that in significant respects takes that fact into account. But perhaps there is less conflict than one might think between maximizing on a firm-specific basis and taking account of the objective function of portfolio investors. If pricing of the firm’s stock is embedded in Modern Portfolio Theory, then running the firm in accord with the preferences of portfolio investors may well produce the highest stock price. But note, while this might produce the best risk-adjusted returns for the portfolio investor, it will not for the undiversified investor, who may have a substantial investment in the specific firm. So this conclusion follows: The doctrinal framing of the board’s role in terms of a single-firm model casts a veil over how board decisions are commonly made, which takes account of the desires and interests of the firm’s dominant, sometimes controlling but sometimes fully diversified, shareholders. The McRitchie court is plainly correct that a board cannot be compelled, as a matter of Delaware fiduciary law, to take account of the interests of diversified investors in the management of the firm, particularly as regards externalities and even patently obvious systemic externalities such as climate change. But the court’s rhetoric goes too far in its insistence on an exclusively firm-specific focus. Surely the firm can seek to avoid externalities, including the systemic externalities that diversified investors will be keenest to avoid. Delaware fiduciary law does not require profit maximization at the cost of what the board determines are externalities that it wants to avoid. More generally the board has freedom under the umbrella of the business judgment rule, certainly if framed as in consideration of the long term as well as the short term, to take into account the pecuniary and non-pecuniary interests of the actual shareholders of the company. So if the board can consider the interests of the shareholders who are controllers, it ought to be able to consider the interests of the shareholders who are diversified portfolio investors. As noted above, this already occurs. The key question is preserving the legitimacy of directors in taking these actions. This is why the integrity of shareholder voting is critical and must be protected. This has been acknowledged in Delaware, most recently in the striking down of anti-activist pills[23] but also more broadly.[24] At the end of McRitchie v. Zuckerberg, Vice Chancellor Laster plays a trump card in turning down plaintiff’s request for an injunction that would impose affirmative duties on a board and management to reduce externalities. Such a mandatory approach is not sustainable, he says. Objecting corporations and shareholders would simply leave. Delaware corporate law does not provide the lever to force corporations to take what at least some shareholders regard as a more pro-social approach. For scholars of corporate law and governance VC Laster’s final paragraphs on the plaintiff’s claim are sobering: By explicitly rejecting the notion that a board of directors can act loyally when consciously deciding to violate positive law in pursuit of greater profits, Delaware ensures that positive laws and regulations have bite. Through those laws and regulations, governments can impose meaningful restrictions on externalities. Through its corporate law, Delaware supports those efforts. It is frankly difficult for Delaware to use corporate law to do more. Reformers who look to Delaware law to address externalities must acknowledge the larger political environment. Delaware is one of fifty states, each of which can offer entities embodying different corporate law packages. Delaware is not California. Among the fifty states, Delaware has one of the smaller human populations (only around one million souls), one of the smallest geographical areas (albeit conveniently located), and a relatively small economy (though mighty in spirit). Delaware does not have the market power to force anyone to use its corporations, its law, or its courts. Delaware must identify niches where it has a comparative advantage—like corporate law—so that entrepreneurs want to use its corporations, legal practitioners want to choose its law, and parties want to litigate in its courts. Delaware has traditionally filled the corporate law niche by taking a distinctively nonpartisan, technocratic approach. Delaware seeks to supply corporate practitioners with a flexible legal framework, broadly enabling in character but subject to some mandatory floors, that gives managers (framed broadly) expansive discretion to take risks and pursue profit, while at the same time protecting the legitimate rights and expectations of investors. Delaware has not used its corporate law to address hot-button social issues or to intervene in societal debates. Depending on an observer’s political leanings, there are any number of salient issues that Delaware might use its corporate law to address. But to the extent the General Assembly sought to intervene on any of them, entrepreneurs who did not like the answer could incorporate their firms elsewhere. Strong externality regulation is just one example. If the General Assembly sought to make Delaware the externality regulatory for the country (or the world), corporations who did not agree could readily opt out. The lesson is a broader one. State-based corporate law in general, and Delaware law in particular, is a poor vehicle for addressing externalities. Delaware law mandates that its entities and the fiduciaries who manage them comply with positive law. That legal requirement promotes legal compliance in its own right, while also providing a mechanism for holding fiduciaries accountable when they knowingly cause an entity to violate positive law. To ask more from state-based corporate law is to pick the wrong tool for the job.[25] So: “’Delaware law does not charter law breakers,”’[26] and officers and directors may incur liability in a derivative suit if they intentionally violate the law, and, it seems, if they egregiously fail in their oversight duty with respect to compliance. In this way Delaware corporate law sails parallel to the democratic process that enacted these laws. In In re Match Group, Inc. Derivative. Litig and in Tornetta v. Musk, we learned that Delaware facilitates shareholder democracy by relying on shareholders to determine the decision rule in a contested fiduciary duty case where, but only where, appropriate disclosure and process have been followed. In McRitchie v. Zuckerberg we learned that the court will honor shareholder decisions to redraw corporate purposes and the board’s duties in the corporation’s foundation documents but will not “blue pencil” those measures through law-like imposition. While Delaware corporate law is not a tool to compel what some might regard as pro-social behavior (other than compliance with law),Delaware would permit directors broad discretion in deciding which externalities to address and to what extent and would treat this permission as subject not to judicial review but to shareholder acquiescence. That leaves ample space for shareholders to petition, for directors to act, and for shareholders, through the processes of corporate democracy, to have the last word.

Assume the target has 100 shares outstanding. Controller owns 50, the public owns 50, the stock trades at $10 per share, based on the company’s expected future cash flows. The controller deems its private benefits are worth $1.50 per share. A prospective bidders believe it can improve the company’s operations by 10 percent and so is prepared to bid up to $11 a share for all shares. The controller refuses, even though the company would, on a cash flow basis, be more valuable after the transaction. [16] The complaint is oddly framed in terms of externalities without any obvious connection to a portfolio investor’s pecuniary interests. It maybe that Meta’s engagement algorithms produce socially harmful behaviors and may spread misinformation that affects elections or disrupts teenage sociability. The impact on the economy and thus the other stocks in the investor’s portfolio is far from clear. There is nothing about the fact of portfolio investing that would necessarily incline such an investor to be more concerned about such harms than an undiversified Meta investor; the reverse seems more likely since the undiversified investor may feel more responsibility for Meta’s conduct.
