March 05, 2025 17:26 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) between May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Querio v. AppLovin Corporation, et al. (Case No. 5:25-cv-02294) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. If you suffered a loss in APP securities, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.

Title: Futarchy As Meta Governance

Full Content:
While anyone can buy stock in public firms, private firms are instead held by a more concentrated and exclusive set of owners. Such firms tend to make higher returns than public firms, and are more responsive to investment opportunities. They tend to be taken public when they reach a stable situation where managers can just “milk the cow”, while public firms tend to be taken private when they start to face many big new decisions. The basic idea is this: when CEOs of public firms make substantial and uncertain investments, they face the immediate judgment of market speculators, expressed in the firm’s stock price. And without a good inside view of particular investments, speculators have to rely on the average return of such public firm investments, which tends to be bad. So the firm stock price falls, after which the CEO may not last long enough to see if their investments actually pay off. Thus CEOs of public firms tend to invest only when they can show speculators enough to convince them of their investments’ unusual value. So they tend to make investments that are clearly much like successful prior projects, and so can be judged on the track records of such projects. In contrast, CEOs of private firms typically hold far larger personal fractions of the firm’s stock, and so consider their investments more carefully. They can invest using info that they can’t effectively communicate to market speculators, and so they can make novel investments, different from what they and others have done before. Thus private firms seem to be a superior form of firm governance. Why then are there any public firms? Because there are only a limited number of skilled CEOs and trusted partners rich enough to take firms private. Over the decades, we have been creating more such people, and a larger fraction of business firms have been converted to private equity. And until the public can more easily invest in private firms, their money will have to go somewhere. All this could be see as a critique of futarchy, since futarchy picks actions using the info that is available to market speculators. Without access to the extra info typically available to private firm CEOs, such speculators must make the sorts of judgments that public firm speculators typically do about possible firm investments. Thus, for max profits, it seems better to take a firm private than to have it run either by a CEO responsive to a public stock price, or by futarchy speculators who advise particular decisions. Futarchy might be able to advise a public firm on whether to go private, but that decision seems to be well made by a simple auction. If private investors are willing to pay more for the firm than public investors, it should go private. But alas we typically block this sort of solution via poison pills, and maybe people would be more willing to listen to futarchy advice on this key decision. Futarchy seems to have a better chance of advising public firms on key decisions where we suspect the CEO might be biased. Such on whether to replace the CEO, or on how much more money to raise from investors, when, and at what price. But while this is a reasonable hope, it is far from a sure thing. The best case for futarchy seems to be in cases where we are just not sure that max profits, even if expertly executed, is the outcome we want. Then we can use a futarchy tied to some other outcomes that we better trust, and ask futarchy either re specific decisions, or whether to hand off decisions to something else, like a private firm. Or whether to later change back from a private allocation. Competing private firms seem to be our best known institution for getting the most profits from some area of life. And we economists do have good reasons to expect that this is often the best way for everyone to get the more of what they want. But we economists also know of many plausible exceptions, and many others have stronger doubts than economists about for-profit ventures. So there’s a place for an institution that makes reliable, unbiased judgements about the effects of key decisions on other outcomes, judgements that are quite well informed compared to most other institutions, even if not as well informed as private choices. We can plausibly best trust this institution for our most meta decisions, on which other institutions to use when and where. The main more meta decision that remains is: what are the ex-post measurable outcomes for futarchy to use when making these decisions? It seems like you're using the term "private equity firm" as a synonym for "private firm" here, considering that you contrast and compare it with "public firm." Are you using the term right? To my understanding a private equity firm is a private firm that manages a portfolio of investments in other firms. It's not just any firm that's privately owned. I'm not so sure about your explanation for why a private firm would have a higher rate of return. If the problem with public firms is that CEOs are getting ousted too quickly, it's not the average uninformed investor doing that - it's large activist investors and board members. Activist investors and board members would be highly informed in what's going on with the company. A decision markets based system like futarchy could help public CEOs engage in longer-term bets, traditionally an advantage of private ownership. As it stands there is market feedback but only in the crude form of stock price which can be interpreted in many ways, and there is never a clean signal that "yes we like this long-term bet you're proposing". It also seems more practical to implement futarchy in business than in government. Idea: The bet you make as a participant in the decision market is of the form: I will buy X shares of the company at $Y/share and (enforceably) commit to holding those shares for 3 years, contingent on the proposed decision being enacted. That way a public CEO could pitch their case, see who bites, and commit when there is confirmed demand. The example I would love to see right now is: should Intel divest its fab business into a separate company? It's a clean yes/no question and part of Intel's indecision is they don't have a good way of testing market response. No posts Ready for more?

By The Editors of ARTnews, Art in America March 5, 2025 8:00am A global recession, a pandemic, 9/11, the Arab Spring, Brexit, the rise of Web 2.0, unrest in the face of economic stability, wars in Afghanistan, Ukraine, Gaza, and elsewhere: these were but a few of the many events that have defined the past 25 years, a period characterized by tumult and uncertainty. That all may explain why art appeared to change faster than ever all the while, with artists burning through styles and tendencies with each coming year. With the 21st century now at the quarter point, we’ve taken the opportunity to pinpoint the greatest artworks of the past 25 years. Even though we set down some parameters for ourselves (more on that here), it was no small task—one made more difficult by the restless creativity of artists during this period. The joy of an epic list like this one is that it can’t encapsulate everything: we know we’ve left some artworks off, simply because there was no shortage to choose from. We hope you’ll discover some amazing pieces here, reflect on some that are much-loved already, and debate the merits of others. And moreover, we hope to learn of new artworks through the conversations we hope our list inspires. Below, a look back at the greatest 100 artworks of the 21st century so far, as selected by the editors of ARTnews and Art in America. This article features contributions from the following writers: Francesca Aton, Andy Battaglia, Daniel Cassady, Anne Doran, Sarah Douglas, Maximilíano Durón, Alex Greenberger, Harrison Jacobs, Tessa Solomon, and Emily Watlington. Even from pictures, I can still feel the headache I got from this work’s pungent presence. Half a million cigarettes lean against each other to form a tiger skin carpet; walk around it, and see the colors change. By the time it premiered at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, the world’s tobacco-growing capital had shifted from Virginia to China, where Xu Bing is based. Yet in Chinese branding, “Virginia Tabacco” and other romanticized references to colonial lore still abound. Xu chose the cigarette brand 1st Class because it was one of the few still grown and distributed in the United States. The work’s mass and materiality were not only stunning and stinky; the piece’s enormity gave a glimpse of global supply chains. —E.W. In the uneasy images from this series, crowds of people look up at trees or poles that seem totally unremarkable. In fact, those trees once contained something horrifying: lynched Latinx, Asian, and Native American men. These lynchings have not often been recognized in the historical record, and Ken Gonzales-Day wanted to call attention to them. Rather than reproduce the bodies of these men, however, Gonzales-Day used image editing software to remove them. The focus here, instead, is the white people who attended the lynchings, creating a public spectacle of this brutality and then circulating images of it via postcards, which the artist collected. Gonzales-Day’s jarring images force viewers to reckon with a form of collective violence that is perpetrated by regular people, frequently with little to no consequences. —M.D. Before becoming an artist, Jordan worked as a diver. Underwater, she became fascinated by the symbiotic relationships shared by sea cucumbers and certain fish, who hide from predators in, of all places, the sea cucumber’s anus. Longing for such symbiosis, she turned to the potato, a German transplant much like herself, welcoming it in. First, she made a video in which she appeared to grow a potato in her own butt. Then, when the Humboldt Forum reopened in Berlin in 2021, the project got a second life. In protest of the institution, Jordan replied to the Forum’s invitation with a proposal astronomically overbudget. Home to looted objects in what was once an Imperialist palace, the Forum was occupied by Friedrich II—the king who made potatoes, native to the Andes, a German staple. Miraculously, the Forum accepted. At the grand reopening, Jordan lined the entrance with 3D-printed copies of her rump—33 of them, that butt-shaped number—all with tubers growing from her anus. This cheeky retort to nationalism and imperialism was a reminder that Germany’s treasures, even its cuisine, are extracted from elsewhere. More recently an image of Jordan’s potato-filled rump was used on posters protesting Germany’s crackdown on immigration, as if asking, will they deport kartoffel next? —E.W. Produced in the wake of Occupy Wall Street and a couple years after Meta (né Facebook) made facial recognition ubiquitous, Zach Blas’s Facial Weaponization Suite explores the sinister undercurrent of our surveillance state. For the work, Blas held workshops to collect the facial data of participants, and aggregated it to produce what he termed “collective masks.” Bulbous, strange, and an off-putting shade of magenta, the masks are meant not only to make users unidentifiable, but to protest the technology’s supposed objectivity. The most successful of them, Fag Face Mask, was generated with data solely from queer men in response to efforts to use the technology to determine sexual orientation, a goal obviously ripe for pseudoscience and stereotyping. Other versions respond to the targeting of immigrants and other minorities. More than a decade later, with immigrants, minorities, queer, and trans people under ever-heightening threat, perhaps it’s time to take up Blas’s call to challenge the techno-capitalist order. —H.J. As Schutz’s canvases have grown larger and her compositions more elaborate over the years, it is easy to forget the raw energy of the “Frank” paintings. An exhibition of them, at the now-defunct Zach Feuer gallery in New York, was the first time many of us encountered Schutz’s work and the punch that it packed. The show was called “Frank from Observation,” Frank being a fictional character Schutz made up; he lived on a desert island and was the last person alive. I’ve always considered the title of the show a double entendre: To paint something frankly is to paint something made of paint. Or, as David Salle has observed is Schutz’s greatest asset, “the imagining is inseparable from the paint itself.” (Or, again, as Nicole Eisenman put it more recently: “Someone like Dana Schutz is fantastic because she is painting with her eyes closed.”) This painting stands out from the other Frank paintings in the series because Frank has apparently become something else: a proboscis monkey. Is his mind so addled from isolation that he is imagining this? Is this a painting of Frank’s imagination? The mysteries have only deepened and become more complex with Schutz’s more recent canvases—which have occasionally courted controversy, as one did during the 2017 Whitney Biennial. —S.D. Barriers (Stanchions) comprises rows and rows of retractable belt barriers, arranged to form a maze. At the end stands a vinyl poster printed with a poignant statement borrowed from materials disseminated by the organization Immigration Equality: “FOR LGBT IMMIGRANTS, DEPORTATION CAN BE A DEATH SENTENCE. IT’S TIME FOR A NEW APPROACH.” What would such an approach entail? Surely, one that requires fewer of these seemingly innocuous barriers seen everywhere from national borders to airports, from DMV offices to museum admissions desks. —A.G. Wellness often gets talked about as if it is a science: Which treatments are the best, and how do they work? This leaves out a whole lot: the feelings elicited by buying things in search of healing, and the culture that wellness has brought about. Long before Gwyneth Paltrow’s pivot to Goop girlboss, Shana Moulton created an alter ego named Cynthia who was obsessed, like Paltrow, with finding the perfect cure. Cynthia isn’t trying to sell you anything, though. In this 10-part online soap opera, absurdist videos show Cynthia chasing the high of trying something new. She does so with a wink and a nod—and also with earnest hope, something that distances Whispering Pines from the woman-hating found in many critiques of wellness culture. Moulton’s series was pivotal in steering feminist art’s conversations about bodily difference toward the realm of disability, making space for ailments as a subject in art. —E.W. New Red Order, a public secret society founded in 2016 that comprises artists Jackson Polys, Adam Khalil, and Zack Khalil, along with their collaborators, has slyly critiqued settler colonialism via installation art that calls for greater recognition than simple land acknowledgments. The group’s film Give It Back focuses on the Land Back movement, which seeks the return of ancestral lands to Indigenous people. The film features testimonials about white people who have given their land back, but this is no documentary. Jim Fletcher, a white actor who has played Indigenous characters, is shown here giving an MTV Cribs-style tour of the Upper East Side apartment that houses the Gochman Family Collection, which focuses on Indigenous contemporary art. Fletcher then uses the New Red Order film as a platform to recruit others to the cause. This is a classic New Red Order gag in which irony and seriousness combine, confusing any potential allies. As usual, New Red Order gets the last laugh. —M.D. This video was a case of right place, right time. As serious conversations about the presence of Confederate monuments in American cities were gaining momentum, the Serbian artist made this essay film about monuments cropping up in the Western Balkans after the Yugoslav wars. These statues offered a means to remember histories without heroes: The artist dubbed them “turbo sculptures,” drawing on turbo-folk, a musical genre that emerged in the former Yugoslavia, combining folk tunes with techno. The video introduces bizarre statues of Bruce Lee in Bosnia, then Rocky Balboa and Johnny Depp in Serbia, asking whether these pop icons represented a healthy rejection of nationalism, or just denial in the wake of ethnic wars. Turbo sculpture’s absurdism was not unlike that proffered by other Eastern European artists who were introduced chaotically to capitalism’s dizzying variety. Last year, for her Kunsthalle Vienna retrospective, Domanović updated the work to account for the citizen toppling of the Bruce Lee statue, a reminder that nothing is permanent, neither humor nor history, no matter how sturdily sculpted. —E.W. The US military’s Iraq War–era insistence that waterboarding was not “torture” defied credulity. Bilal made a proposition to test the claim. Online, the Iraqi artist created a poll, asking the world to vote: Should he waterboard a dog or himself? If waterboarding wasn’t torture, after all, it should be no big deal to enlist others—or was it only no big deal when Iraqis were the recipients? Bilal “won” the poll after PETA stepped in (fair enough, considering the artist was the only consenting party). On video, he covered his face in cloth before pouring water over it in a process that simulates drowning. At the end of the video, Bilal, choking, says that “anyone who said it’s not torture should try it.” Here as ever, he puts his skin in the game in solidarity with the many other bodies on the line. —E.W. This brilliant artwork correctly diagnosed the art fair as a site for entertainment: Visitors pay their $30 admission and expect something big and shiny in return, and so, we got Jeff Koons’s diamond rings and hanging hearts and balloon dogs to gawk at—what critic Ben Davis called “bling conceptualism,” exemplified by Terence Koh redoing a Sol Lewitt in gold leaf and bronze (along with a gold leaf and bronze pile of dog poop). When you strolled past the booth of Gavin Brown’s Enterprise at Art Basel Miami Beach 2006 and saw nothing but a crumpled-up cigarette pack on the floor, you felt swindled. But if you stood there for a moment and waited, the thing, attached by transparent fishing line to an unseen mechanism in the ceiling, started dancing around. It is still one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen, a real fuck-you to the whole system. —S.D. In the mid-’90s, Laura Aguilar began a body of work in which she photographed herself and others in the nude, in a variety of landscapes. “Grounded,” her final series and the only one she ever did in color, was photographed in the rugged desert landscape of Joshua Tree National Park. These images are most impactful when they verge on abstraction. In Grounded #111, we see her nude body from behind in front of a much larger beige rock. She is seated on the ground, her back curving as she leans forward, and it takes a second to register that her body is indeed a body at all. The majesty of this natural landscape now includes Aguilar, and that was exactly her point: She wanted viewers to confront her nude fat body and appreciate it in the same way one might contemplate a desert. In doing so, Aguilar forced viewers to confront their own standards of beauty. —M.D. Growing up in Manhattan—specifically, Chelsea—Johnson has witnessed the increasing privatization of urban space firsthand. “Loiter” began when he noticed a certain form this phenomenon took: those medieval-looking spiked-metal contraptions affixed to standpipes, installed to prevent people from sitting on them as benches have become increasingly rare. To draw attention to this form of privatization, and to intervene in it, Johnson began removing the spikes from public areas, displaying them in galleries. This made the standpipes potential seating once again and produced new sculptures too. The effect is critique and repair together: not just a found object with a dark story, but one whose displacement is a victory. —E.W. During the 2005 Venice Biennale, Frieze magazine sent out SMS messages with hints as to what you would see in the national pavilions. The one for Germany was especially cryptic: The display was said to be “so contemporary.” This was the first time many encountered—“encounter” being the operative word—the work of Tino Sehgal, whose performers were seen dancing around you as soon as you made your way into the building. “This is so contemporary, contemporary, contemporary!” they sang. Sehgal had by then become known among curators as one of the primary figures associated with relational aesthetics, a tendency in which artists offered conversations and interactions, not objects, as artworks. A fair number of such works were whimsical and moving: Rirkrit Tiravanija’s 1990s meals-as-art come to mind. But This Is So Contemporary! was relational aesthetics at its most charming. —S.D. When President Joe Biden ended the war in Afghanistan, he did so abruptly: US troops left overnight with no real plan in place for an Afghan future. Predictably, the Taliban took over the next day. In their scramble, the troops left behind a bunch of trash: Gatorade bottles, junk food bags, tires, jugs. Hazara kindly collected all that garbage, effectively cleaning up the mess the Americans left behind for a gesture he has referred to as “a gift to the American people.” Then, he assembled it all into various installations that have traveled to Melbourne, Milan, Bombay, Kolkata, Sharjah, and Berlin. Next fall, at SculptureCenter in New York, the trash will return home, in a pointed provocation ultimately made of flimsy, powerless stuff. —E.W. Santiago Yahuarcani was one of the standouts of a 2024 Venice Biennale that celebrated the vastness and underacknowledged variety of the world, and El mundo del agua (The world of the water) is one of the paintings that broadcast his spirited engagement with Indigenous histories and allegiance to the land. As a member of the Aimeni (White Heron) clan of the Uitoto Nation of northern Amazonia, Yahuarcani channels stories of cosmological creatures, colonial conflict, and ancestral legacies, often on llanchama (a type of parchment made from bark). In El mundo del agua, mermaids rise, snakes writhe, and a marine organism smokes a pipe—all with a sense of intricacy and electricity that make it seem ancient and contemporary at once. —A.B. Though her output has encompassed a dizzying range of mediums, German artist Isa Genzken is best known for her sculpture, from fabricated pieces such as her lacquered-wood “Ellipsoids” of the 1970s and architectonic cast-concrete pieces of the late 1980s to her mixed-media assemblages of the 1990s (which, being in step with the work of younger American artists like Rachel Harrison and Jessica Stockholder, brought her increased visibility in the United States). Despite shifts in modes and materials, a consistent theme in Genzken’s art has been a fascination with modernist design and architecture, particularly their interaction with the messy business of urban life. First shown at New York’s AC Project Room in 2000, “Fuck the Bauhaus (New Buildings for New York)”—a group of six sculptures pieced together from scraps of found cardboard, foam core, plastic, and glass—epitomize the irreverent yet formally sophisticated approach that has marked Genzken’s art for half a century. —A.D. Kudzu, a fast-growing plant that the American government brought from Japan to the US in 1876, is an invasive species that is difficult to contain. In this installation, however, kudzu is something to behold, a species that fascinates because of its unwillingness to be hemmed in. Taking the work’s title from a Fred Moten essay, Precious Okoyomon intended the kudzu as a parallel for Blackness, given the plant’s history as a means of fighting the lingering environmental effects of cotton production in the American South. Fittingly, the artist has described both kudzu and Blackness as being “indispensable to and irreconcilable with Western civilization.” —A.G. Four decades ago, the Guerilla Girls made a name for themselves by provocatively calling attention to the disparities faced by women artists within museums and galleries. In 2018 they returned with an incisive rumination on how the art world handles allegations of sexual harassment and assault against artists—straight white males in particular—in the wake of the #MeToo movement. For this work, the Guerrilla Girls took on the case of artist Chuck Close, who the previous year had been accused of sexual harassment by women who had modeled for him. They presented three versions of a museum wall label for the artist’s 1992 portrait of Bill Clinton: one for museums “afraid of alienating billionaire trustees,” one for “conflicted” museums, and one for “museums who need help from the Guerrilla Girls.” The final text is the only one to mention the allegations; it ends with “the art world tolerates abuse because it believes art is above it all, and rules don’t apply to ‘genius’ white male artists. WRONG!” The work reminds viewers that even something as simple and didactic as a museum label is never objective. —M.D. The community of Kinngait (known as Cape Dorset until 2020) in Nunavut, northern Canada, has produced such renowned Inuit artists as Kananginak Pootoogook, Pitseolak Ashoona, and Kenojuak Ashevak, largely through the West Baffin Eskimo Cooperative, an art studio established in 1959. Until late in the 20th century, works from this cooperative tended toward subjects such as birds, fish, and other animals, as well as idealized scenes of traditional Inuit life. Both Ashoona, Annie Pootoogook’s grandmother, and Napachie Pootoogook, her mother, however, were among the first Inuit artists to create autobiographical artworks. Following their example, Pootoogook likewise based her drawings on personal experience, including her struggles with addiction and—as here—abusive relationships. Her work found fame in the larger world (it was included in Documenta 12 in 2007), but the artist drowned in Ottawa’s Rideau River in 2016 at age 47. Whether an accident, suicide, or murder, her death remains a mystery. —A.D. The imminent has at last caught up with Tishan Hsu, whose work since the 1980s has imagined how digital technologies might transform our visual world, our consciousness, and even our bodies. The pieces Hsu made while a denizen of the 1980s East Village art scene comported with the quasi-minimalist sculptures of the time, but they differed from those by, say, Ashley Bickerton or Haim Steinbach in that they pondered a data-driven future rather than a commodity-oriented present. As Hsu told art critic Martha Schwendener in 2021, “All of my work is really an effort to come up with something that would convey this paradigm that I felt would become very influential, that would have a huge impact on our reality, and that I was already seeing [happen] in much simpler ways.” By the 1990s Hsu was using emerging software like Photoshop to create silk-screened works with photo-based imagery. Since then, rapid advances in computer imaging have afforded the artist the tools he needed to produce hybrid pieces like this one, which combines references to bodies (photos of eyes and flesh-colored silicone protuberances); a screenshot of a quotidian exchange between a user and a program; and an enveloping, vaguely reptilian digital “skin.” —A.D. Perhaps you want to license a digital photograph of a nubile young woman bent over an open dishwasher and smelling a freshly laundered flip-flop? You can do so, for only $200, via DISimages, a library of stock photography that enlisted artists such as Katja Novitskova, Dora Budor, and Anicka Yi to produce the hundreds of images hosted on a website that effectively offers the same services as iStock and Shutterstock. The photographs DIS sold here appropriate the sleek brightly lit aesthetic of stock pictures, except that here, all the subject matter appears dark and downright bizarre. Was DISimages an ironic stunt, a ploy for attention? Not even the collective’s members could agree. But when DISimages went viral on social media, it laid bare an online appetite for meaninglessness, with a side of absurdist humor. —A.G. Debates about who is allowed to represent whom lit the internet on fire when Dana Schutz showed a painting of Emmett Till, a Black teenager abducted and lynched by a white mob, at the 2017 Whitney Biennial. In one particularly controversial remark, Schutz defended herself, saying, “I don’t know what it is like to be black in America. But I do know what it is like to be a mother.” Hamishi Farah extended her logic, painting a blond child Farah claimed was Schutz’s son, Arlo, an image of whom he had found online. In so doing, Farah asked how it feels to have one’s child painted into a political debate. —A.G. In this 11-minute film, one of the most intimate artworks I’ve ever seen, we watch Sophie Calle’s mother’s final moments. At first, the French artist hadn’t meant for the video to be art at all; she had simply left a camera rolling in her mother’s final days, hoping to stay connected when she had to step out and run errands. But then she noticed something profound she thought was worth sharing: though in the footage you are watching someone die, death itself is impossible to see. In the video, Calle’s mother is shown lying still in bed, and after she dies, she simply lies still some more—this is a moving image that doesn’t move. Here, Calle managed to show me something I’d truly never seen before, even though it happens every day. —E.W. After the curator Okwui Enwezor stumbled upon a screening in India by the history-major-turned-filmmaker Amar Kanwar, he liked the film he saw—A Season Outside (1997)—so much that he commissioned a sequel. The follow-up, A Night of Prophecy (2002), premiered in Documenta 11, Enwezor’s defining exhibition that ushered in contemporary art’s so called “global turn.” In this feature film, Kanwar records vernacular poetry—sayings people share—derived from times of conflict, spanning eleven languages from across India. In one memorable line, a young Dalit boy asks his mother whether he is Hindu or Muslim. She replies with a searing line borrowed from a 1970s Prakash Jadhav poem—one likely passed down orally, as few Dalits then had access to literacy education—telling him, “You are an abandoned spark of the world’s lusty fires.” A Night of Prophecy implies that history is recorded not through timelines or forensics so much as the traces of poetry that they leave behind, the stories those most affected pass down. —E.W. A multitude of artists mined archives of all kinds during the 21st century, re-presenting information about under-examined histories in unexpected ways. Tiona Nekkia McClodden exemplified the trend with her multipart “Brad Johnson Project,” examining the archive of the Black American queer poet Brad Johnson, who died in 2011. In a series of 10 videos, McClodden recites Johnson’s works; the final entry shows her hanging upside-down as she reads his 1988 poem “On Subjugation,” as a way to make visceral the subjugation Johnson describes. For the installation version of this work, McClodden places a screen showing the video behind the structure from which she was suspended; that structure is itself hung with her boots and accompanied by a smattering of earth, rose petals, and naval and leather/BDSM paraphernalia. Taken together, these objects give us a fuller sense of Johnson and the life he lived. In looking to queer ancestors of the past and filling in the gaps, McClodden was able to make something wholly new, moving, and poignant. —M.D. Why does the woman in this picture look so familiar? Because she’s meant to. Conceptual artist Christopher Williams’s work, usually produced by professional studios, often mimics 20th-century commercial, ethnographic, or architectural photographs. While deconstructing how such photographs continue to shape our present late-late-capitalist reality, the artist also deconstructs how they were made—here, by including a usually hidden Kodak tool. The photo’s subject is a model Williams chose using the criteria given in a casting call for Jacques Tati’s 1967 film Playtime. Her pose, open-mouthed smile, and towel-wrapped hair vividly recall bath soap ads of the 1960s and ’70s. In another nod to Kodak, the towel is the exact shade of the company’s signature yellow packaging. Despite, or perhaps because of, such extreme deliberation, the resulting artwork is as seductive as the advertisements that inspired it. —A.D. Informed by a visit to a pearl-making facility in China in 2014, this video captures the delicate and repetitive tasks Mika Rottenberg witnessed—in particular, the extracting and sorting of pearls. In her absurdist take on the subject, Rottenberg links these activities with a range of other seemingly unconnected ones: an administrative worker rings a bell that prompts a Chinese factory worker to turn a handle, powering a fan that then blows pollen from a bouquet of flowers into her nose. The sneezes that result mimic the way that oysters, when irritated by grains of sand, eventually produce pearls. But you don’t need to know that Rottenberg’s strange fictions are in fact based in truth for this video, which highlights the global economy’s various forms of exploitation and production that ultimately give way to the treasures we call our own. —F.A. Like many of the most memorable creations by the perennially probing and prescient Pierre Huyghe, After ALife Ahead became all the more identifiable as a work by Huyghe when it started to stray from the control of the artist himself. He created this work—a “time-based bio-technical system,” as he called it—for the 2017 edition of Skulptur Projekte Münster, where it took the form of a sort of excavation of a former ice rink that was transformed into an alternately earthy and technology-abetted biosphere, with materials including bacteria, algae, bees, human cancer cells, and phreatic water (water from below the water table), along with a variety of snail whose patterned shell provided information that triggered sound- and color-changing aquarium glass. Altogether it was a kind of tribute to old and new life forces that are stranger than science-fiction. —A.B. It would be easy, in 2025, as Ai Weiwei produces countless LEGO re-creations of art history, to forget just how revolutionary the Chinese artist-activist’s work has been. Travel back to 2008, however, and Ai was in a very different place in his career. That year, a devastating earthquake hit China’s Sichuan province, killing nearly 90,000 people. It was a national tragedy made more devastating by the government’s censorship of information about it. No one truly knew the scope—no one outside the immediate area, that is—until Ai created “a citizen investigation team” to interview survivors, uncovering widespread corruption in building construction, which was to blame for many of the deaths. That effort resulted in Straight. For the installation, Ai and his team collected 200 tons of mangled rebar rods from schools that had collapsed and meticulously straightened them by hand. The rods were then laid out to resemble tectonic plates in a gallery where the names of 5,000 schoolchildren who had died in the quake were displayed on the walls. A tribute to those lost, the installation is a crushing emotional experience to walk through. And, as Ai recalled in 2018, Straight and his other works around the earthquake made him “the most dangerous person in China.” —H.J. South African photographer Zanele Muholi, whose work was the subject of a recent retrospective at Tate Modern, prefers to be known as a visual activist. Born in 1972, they began studying at photojournalist David Goldblatt’s famed Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg in 2001. The following year, they began photographing members of South Africa’s LGBTQI community, individuals whose rights are constitutionally protected but who are nevertheless frequent victims of discrimination, harassment, and sexual and physical violence. In the series of portraits “Faces and Phases” (2006–14), from which this photograph is taken, Muholi focused largely on Black South African lesbians and trans men, a population with which the artist most identifies. While Muholi has since expanded into theatrical self-portraits and color images of LGBTQI people in public places, these tender black-and-white depictions, which insist on the humanity of their subjects, remain some of Muholi’s most poignant images. —A.D. For nearly a decade now, rafa esparza has transformed institutions with installations made of adobe. His installation tierra, made for the 2016 edition of the Hammer Museum’s Made in L.A. biennial, was among the first of these high-profile interventions, covering the museum’s north terrace with adobe bricks that were produced using dirt from Elysian Park, the site of Dodgers Stadium, which had once been a vibrant Chicano community known as Chavez Ravine. At the Hammer, esparza installed found objects in his adobe brick road, including a mailbox and a blue armchair accompanied by a cactus. Such interventions, esparza has said, stem from his “interest in browning the white cube” as a “response to entering traditional art spaces and not seeing myself reflected.” A vital part of this project has been enlisting members of his community in his art: He learned to make adobe bricks from his father, and for this iteration, he brought on his mother and siblings to help out. —M.D. When Luc Tuymans debuted this painting in the aughts, it seemed that the world had little use for more images of Condoleezza Rice. Then National Security Advisor to President George W. Bush, she was responsible for controversially authorizing waterboarding in the so-called “war on terror” while advocating for the invasion of Iraq, falsely claiming the nation possessed weapons of mass destruction. But the Belgian artist’s portrait and its attendant commentary would prove more relevant still. Tuymans was inspired to paint Rice after her 2005 trip to Belgium, when the nation’s foreign affairs minister called her a “strong, not unpretty woman.” Her neck and chin are cropped out, and her brow is furrowed. The painting’s sickly grays and muted beiges offer a decidedly unheroic vision of this high-ranking politician, neatly encapsulating the distrust of authority that was in the air post-9/11 in the US and beyond, and turning the power dynamics of portraiture on its head. —A.G. In 2014 Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank shot and killed two unarmed teenagers, Nadeem Nawara and Mohammad Abu Daher. The case hinged at the time on whether the soldiers used rubber bullets, as they claimed, or illegally fired live rounds. Together with Forensic Architecture, the London-based research group that investigates armed conflicts, Lawrence Abu Hamdan performed an acoustic analysis of the gunshots, audio of which was captured and disseminated widely alongside video of the incident. Israel initially claimed that its soldiers could not have killed the two teens, but Abu Hamdan’s research suggested otherwise: The soldiers, he ultimately proved, had fired live rounds. A year or so later, he reimagined the body of evidence as Earshot, an installation comprising photographs, video, and audio. The gallery thus became another court of culpability. Here, art functioned as journalism should, with the power to hold politics accountable to fact. —T.S. During the late ’90s, Apple’s Macintosh computer touted a sleek aesthetic, distinct from the less user-friendly PC. That’s why, for this “desktop performance,” as the artists call it, the Dutch duo JODI—Joan Heemskerk and Dirk Paesmans—used a Mac to induce a dizzying experience, one at odds with Apple’s claims of seamlessness. Using an OS 9 operating system, JODI opened up folders within folders, files upon files, until it all climaxed into chaos. Hosted as an interactive work on JODI’s website and later recorded via screen capture, the piece required its user to close out of an overwhelming barrage of windows, putting Apple’s marketing to the stress test. With My%Desktop, one of the defining works of net art, JODI shows how Apple streamlined, and perhaps even sanitized, the act of computing, alluding to how the corporation tried to obscure computational processes. —A.G. Wangechi Mutu had in mind a specific mother while creating this collage: Funmilayo Anikulapo-Kuti, whose son was the pioneering Nigerian musician Fela Kuti. Yet the woman shown here is just as easily a stand-in for many more women, specifically “all the mothers who give us our voices and empower us to be who we are and believe in our talents,” as Mutu put it in an interview published alongside her 2023 New Museum retrospective. Her subject is shown sinking a stiletto into the neck of a severed serpent, a “monster that managed to span two … continents,” per Mutu, who has also said that the work shows opposites colliding: “African/European, archaic/modern, religion/pornography.” The result is a fantastical world filled with disco balls and gigantic jellyfish, with implicit critiques, unglued from reality, laying the ground for a whole new world. —A.G. This installation was a progenitor of the blockbuster immersive video boom that critics love to hate. Indeed, it got the kinds of criticism such videos get today: that it was too pretty, that it was merely spectacle. When it debuted at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, Jerry Saltz wrote that the piece served as but a backdrop while visitors typed on laptops or hung out. In protest of the video’s lulling, hypnotic appeal, another artist even staged a yoga class inside MoMA. But beneath the piece’s consumable veneer, Rist sneaked in something subversive: this sleepy, gorgeous film is about menstrual blood. In it, Rist’s protagonist sets out to collect her menses in a silver chalice, but rendered in fuchsia instead of scarlet. Floating freely in an underwater world, her blood feels palatable, even pretty. Rist’s feat was making menstrual blood as boring and ordinary as it really is. —E.W. Paul Chan’s 1st Light conjures a sense of wonder by way of a sort of shadow play projected on the floor. For 14 minutes, in a state of soundlessness that grows more and more profound, the work cycles through a succession of slow-motion imagery that fluctuates between the familiar and the abstract. As if backlit by a window nowhere to be found, a series of squiggles and lines is accompanied by the silhouettes of birds flying off in the distance. Then, shortly after, the shadows of bodies begin to tumble and fall upside-down, turning the mood unmistakably somber. The presence of streetlights and railroad cars suggests an urban setting being torn asunder, and in that, 1st Light summons memories of 9/11 that remain just as haunting now as they were when Chan debuted this work in 2005, four years after that tragic day. —A.B. In 2010 Basel Abbas and Ruanne Abou-Rahme were in Palestine, watching the Arab Spring uprisings through social media. The images of protesting, dancing, and singing that passed through the digital slipstream made them determined to counteract the amnesia of the internet. That impulse evolved into an ongoing project to document and preserve Palestinian culture against its ongoing erasure at the hands of the Israeli state. The work has taken many forms: installations, an interactive web project, public performances, and sculptures. While the ground-level urgency of May amnesia… has never been more clear following the decimation of Gaza, the work is also formally daring. By engaging a digital vernacular that blurs boundaries between artist, subject, and audience, this work refuses a frozen, historicized vision of Palestinian identity. We are still here, the work says in so many ways—still dancing, still singing, still resisting. —H.J. Louise Lawler took this photograph just after Art Basel Miami Beach held its first edition. The weirdness of the fair—its rampant commercialism and fast-paced sales, both seemingly at odds with much of the conceptual art showcased there—may explain Lawler’s unusual approach to photographing Marian Goodman Gallery’s inaugural booth at this event. Here as in other works, Lawler takes aim at works by her well-known male colleagues—in this case, Maurizio Cattelan’s sculpture of Pablo Picasso and Thomas Struth’s photograph of a museum. Rather than shooting these objects straight-on, Lawler pictures them mid-install, such that the head of the Cattelan sculpture is shown separate from the body, which lies on a blanket beneath the Struth photograph. With the Cattelan sculpture represented as though decapitated, Lawler dressed down Picasso, that symbol of male genius, while also offering an unglamorized glimpse of how the sausage that is the art world gets made. —A.G. Themes of capitalism, colonialism, and immigration meet in this work, a one-to-one replica of Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi’s Statue of Liberty. The work’s 300 or so pieces commissioned in 2010 from a fabricator in Shanghai remain forever disassembled. Depending on how they are exhibited and where, the isolated pieces resemble welded copper abstractions, salvaged artifacts or scrap metal sold on the cheap (one piece was even reported missing in 2014). Myriad readings befit the installation, which alludes to the malleability of state symbols, particularly those purporting to represent freedom—whatever that currently means in America. “We the People is not about going to the past,” Vo said of the work on its debut. “Since it’s one of the most important icons for Western liberty I think [it] is very much about the present and our future.” —T.S. For 10 months, artist Paulo Nazareth traversed the Americas, starting from his home state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and ending in Miami, for an edition of Art Basel Miami Beach. Nazareth has described the trek, covering several thousands of miles and 15 countries, as “a residency in transit” and an “accidental residency.” Along the way, Nazareth documented what he saw in photos, videos, texts, and found objects, providing a firsthand look at how grueling the process of migrating from South America to the United States can be, both physically and geopolitically. In one image from the series, a tiny US flag lies under the artist’s bloated dirty feet; in another, he stands before a sign demarcating the Arizona state border holding a placard that reads WE HAVE RIGHTS AT THIS LANDSCAPE. In many ways, the project points to the absurdity of man-made borders, particularly when confronting the perseverance needed to navigate them. —M.D. Second Life, a multiplayer virtual platform popular during the 2000s, beckoned users with the promise of a fresh start in an online-only world. Yet in using the platform for this piece, Cao Fei showed that digital dreams were inextricable from the IRL world. Named after the shorthand used to describe the Chinese yuan, RMB City may have seemed like an escape from 21st-century China, whose citizenry had been reshaped—and alienated—by attempts at globalization. In Cao’s alternate reality, one found a floating panda, carefully manicured fields, and a giant spinning wheel set on a sunny blue isle. But one also found the stuff of unchecked urbanization: a crane, slick yet scarcely populated skyscrapers, a smokestack belching fire. All this combined to form a landscape that was at once familiar and fantastic, showing how our fantasies are hard to cleave neatly from the worlds we know. —A.G. When this 2-channel, 37-minute piece debuted, the animation felt frighteningly cutting-edge. Over a decade on, it’s still uncanny. It’s clear now that this owes less to the technology, which is already dated, than to how Atkins uses it, blending CGI’s sleek hyperrealism with realism of a gritty variety. The computer-generated skinhead protagonist of Us Dead Talk Love has phrases tattooed on his face—they change over the video’s duration, from ASSHOLE to FML to DON’T DIE. We watch him smoking, shirtless, singing a melancholy tune with lyrics proclaiming that love makes us sad, and sadness makes us drink. Scenes show a limp dick, a man passed out at the bar, words like ENFEEBLED and DISAFFECTION hovering in cheesy fonts. It’s all chillingly affecting—its sadness too real, its presentation not real at all, the video’s sheen incongruous with its sorrow. As ever, it’s Atkins’s skillful, poetic writing that carries the piece. —E.W. The protagonist of Wildness is not a person but a place: the Silver Platter, a Los Angeles bar that narrates the film. Founded in the 1960s in the city’s MacArthur Park neighborhood, the Silver Platter has long offered a safe haven to LA’s queer and trans communities, as well as to immigrants from Latin America. (The bar shut down in 2010 and has since reopened under new management.) The film’s backdrop is the bar’s weekly “Wildness” party, organized by director Wu Tsang, who also stars, and DJs NGUZUNGUZU & Total Freedom. Noirish shots of the bar and its environs, weekly drag performances, and people dancing are interspersed with talking-head interviews. Amid all this is a moody narration spoken by Mariana Marroquín and drawn from oral histories by Tsang. Wildness is a portrait of both a bar and a community built by it, where “the struggle to find adequate labels/identities/descriptors for this ‘community’ is precisely what the film is about,” as Tsang once put it. —M.D. Posters and ephemera salvaged from the streets of Mark Bradford’s South Central Los Angeles neighborhood are layered to form the surface of this unconventional painting, which he made by sanding down its various strata, exposing fragments of information embedded between them. The result looks like a form of cartography—a map, perhaps, of a dense network found in the vast metropolis that Bradford calls home. Yet the painting is not only a celebration of South Central: Its title refers to a Roman term of appeasement used to distract the public from more substantial issues, like poverty and disenfranchisement. The work’s beautiful surface could serve as a similar kind of distraction, but his materials make clear that he’s dealing with real problems impacting his community. —F.A. We may want to imagine that nostalgia-inducing franchises from the past are set in stone. But Cory Arcangel suggested with his 2002 installation Super Mario Clouds that everything is inherently fungible. To make the work, Arcangel undertook the laborious process of hacking a Super Mario Bros. cartridge, removing every element except the game’s pixelated clouds and vibrant blue sky. Presented on monitors and projected on nearby walls simultaneously, those clouds now float on without Mario, Luigi, or their cohort to race around beneath them. From the detritus of consumerism, Arcangel forged something new: an artwork that resembled its source material in spirit alone. —A.G. The sculpture represents a person with the creviced face of a 50-year-old man and the body of a grade-school boy—the contrast would be jarring enough even if it weren’t, well, him. Cattelan himself said he nearly destroyed the piece depicting Adolf Hitler after completing it, but in the end, he made it in an edition of three (a fourth copy, the artist’s proof, sold for $17 million at Christie’s in 2016). We think of Hitler as a dark cloud looming over history, but here we are able to look down on the man, who is posed as a supplicant. Cattelan called the piece “a test for our psychoses.” He completed it in early 2001; a half year later came 9/11 to prove that, pace Fukuyama, history had not ended. We live in it still. —S.D. Some 15,000 objects—roughly half of which remain at large today—were looted from the National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad after the American invasion of the country in April 2003. A few years later, Michael Rakowitz set out with the goal of creating to-scale reproductions of every stolen artifact, a project so epic that it is still ongoing. Each replica is made using Middle Eastern commercial packaging for foodstuffs and local Arabic newspapers that were then exported to the US. Though these looted artifacts are now made visible once more, Rakowitz’s efforts also underscore the fragile nature of the originals, which may never return to the Museum. The piece doubles as both a form of institutional critique and a kind of research art: Accompanying labels reveal each original object’s status, and provide additional contextual information about its whereabouts from experts. —F.A. One way to establish intimacy with an audience is to stage an artwork that revolves around plaintively strumming a guitar while naked in a bathtub and singing a song that tugs at the heart and explodes with emotion. That is what Ragnar Kjartansson did for The Visitors, a mesmeric nine-screen video installation that features the Icelandic artist and a cast of his friends bowing, plucking, and picking their way through a cryptic piece of music whose soft spot for slyness and sentiment is clear. Though the title alludes to the name of Swedish pop group ABBA’s last album, the lyrics draw from a poem written by Ásdís Sif Gunnarsdóttir, Kjartansson’s ex-wife, with whom he had recently split. The words aren’t easy to decipher (they’re both sad and uplifting, and the breakup was said to be amicable), but they strike an improbably moving chord when they cycle back around to a much-repeated chorus: “once again I fell into my feminine ways.” —A.B. When Jill Magid was denied access to the professional archives of Mexican architect Luis Barragán—which were bought by the Swiss furniture company Vitra—she turned the problem into an opportunity, steering the genre of institutional critique away from museums and toward corporations. First, she contrived clever ways to get around copyright restrictions. Instead of paying a licensing fee to reproduce a photograph, for instance, she bought a book that had already printed it, then framed the whole book. Forbidden from re-creating his iconic pyramidal lectern, she skirted copyright law by adjusting the scale—that is, until a French show under new jurisdiction required she throw a blanket on top. Despite these persistent public pleas, archival access remained restricted. Then, Magid managed permission for something even wilder: with the consent of Barragán’s family, she exhumed his ashes and turned them into a diamond, which she then used to propose to the archive’s keeper. The offer of her proposal still stands. —E.W. If you needed a reminder of the sheer power of this artwork, you had a chance to see it last year during Paul Pfeiffer’s survey at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. I saw that show, and can report that John 3:16 has aged exceptionally well, given that, if anything, we revere sports stars even more now than we did at the turn of the millennium. On a tiny screen, a basketball appears to dart around a court in the absence of players, their hands merely hinted at. You have to get up close to see this little screen, as you would with a liturgical manuscript. (The piece is named for the famous biblical passage: “For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”) In casting basketball as revelation, Pfeiffer mined footage from the NBA, splicing together clips with the utmost meticulousness, doing for the game what Christian Marclay did for time with The Clock. —S.D. After the Yes Men made DowEthics.com, a website spoofing Dow Chemicals, they received an invitation from a BBC journalist who was apparently not in on the joke. Andy Bichlbaum, a member of the art collective, gleefully accepted, appearing in front of 350 million viewers on the 20th anniversary of the 1984 Bhopal disaster that exposed hundreds of thousands of Indians to toxic gas. The artist, pretending to be a businessman, took “full responsibility” for the gas leak at a pesticide plant and issued an apology to the thousands killed and the many more rendered chronically ill. Stocks plummeted; the Dow retracted. The Yes Men highlighted the authority we bestow on white men in suits, then wielded that power against, well, power itself. —E.W. In the 1980s, after retiring as a machinist at the Pullman boxcar factory in Bessemer, Alabama, Thornton Dial started making assemblage sculptures and reliefs. By the time of his death in 2016 at the age of 87, he had been widely recognized as a major contemporary artist whose work—materially inventive, formally rigorous, and politically astute—rendered the distinction between trained and self-taught immaterial. In 2011 Dial embarked on a series of reliefs inspired by natural disasters, including the Tuscaloosa tornadoes of 2000 and the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011. In this piece, an undulating wave of tree branches, torn metal, and scraps of sequined fabric set against a watery blue and white painted background, he memorialized the devastation Hurricane Katrina caused in New Orleans in 2005 and its disproportionate effect on the city’s largely Black Lower Ninth Ward. —A.D. When the Statue of Liberty reopened following its eight-year hiatus, the mood was tense. Though the destruction of the 9/11 attacks that prompted the closure was in the distance, the trauma of that fateful day remained present. Steve McQueen captured the spirit of this post-9/11 moment with Static, a film in which the camera circles the motionless Lady Liberty pinned to a tiny island not far from Manhattan. Shot from a helicopter, McQueen’s film takes on the perspective of the surveillance technology that became pervasive after the Twin Towers fell, but offers no direct statement on wounded national pride, and thus comes off confounding rather than clarifying. Therein lies its power: It’s a disorienting gesture for a directionless time. —A.G. Jana Euler has strategically deployed ugly images, sometimes in bad taste, as a means of aesthetic assault, and though nearly every one of these efforts is a banger, her most provocative pictures are the ones in her “GWF” series (2019), in which elongated sharks leap out of the ocean. There can be no mistaking the fact that these sharks, with their ribbed gullets and raging heads, look more than a bit like erect phalli. Yet these sharks are hardly seductive: the one shown in GWF 1 flails ungracefully, bearing its teeth and gazing down at the viewer, who seems poised to become the fish’s lunch. Large for a phallus and agile for a shark, Euler’s apex predator is no object of admiration. Instead, it’s simply a dick joke. —A.G. On its face, Daniel Joseph Martinez’s The House America Built seems like a simple, large-scale installation of a small cabin split in two and painted in complementary colors. But what house is this, really? That’s the point of Martinez’s inquiry: the place could belong to just about anyone, even though his reference points are highly specific to American history. The structure is a 1:1 replica of the remote cabin that Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber, built and lived in, and the color palette draws from Martha Stewart’s seasonal collection of interior paints. Kaczynski and Stewart are both Polish Americans, born within a year of each other, and while they took very different paths in life, both were incarcerated in 2004, the year Martinez made the original installation. The piece presents the ends of what Martinez sees as the spectrum of Americanness: Stewart and high capitalism on one, Kaczynski and anarchy and domestic terrorism on the other. —M.D. El Anatsui has made an artistic practice out of stringing together thousands of metal bottle caps to form large, vibrant tapestries, and while he’s repeated the format many times over, it never gets old. Anatsui’s oeuvre reached new heights with this 24-foot-long sheet of caps, which was originally created for the central exhibition in the 2007 Venice Biennale. This work, like his others, cleverly references contemporary overconsumption in material resulting from that consumerism, and is fashioned with gentle folds in a way that recalls traditional Ghanaian craft traditions, like kente cloth. But here, more so than in other works, Anatsui also makes clear that the strung-together caps nod specifically to his own community, whose many members help him make his grandly scaled art. The title, he has said, could be translated from the Ewe to “communal patchwork made by a team of townspeople.” —F.A. Before 3D printing was widely accepted as an artistic medium, Josh Kline embraced it for this unsettling sculpture of a Manhattan hotel housekeeper named Aleyda, whom Kline interviewed and scanned. Featuring to-scale, 3D-printed versions of several of Aleyda’s body parts along with cleaning supplies arrayed on a janitor’s cart, the piece comments on how technology has forever altered the workforce. The plastic cart was purchased and will last, but the body parts and tools of her trade are disposable prototypes about which a question looms: What role will the human hand play in the future of our lives and our art? —A.G. Animators Meriem Bennani and Orian Barki created this series of eight short videos during the first months of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown in New York City. The videos portray friends, strangers, and the artists themselves as digitally created avatars superimposed on real-life footage. Bennani and Barki star as the titular lizards; friends appear as a snow leopard and a hummingbird, among other creatures; and Dr. Anthony Fauci is depicted as a fanged green snake. Strangely, this approach conveys the weirdness of that time and place more effectively than if the artists had made a straightforward documentary. Moments of panic (the lizards freak out during a nighttime drive through a depopulated Brooklyn) and distress (a hospital-nurse cat recalls helping a wife put through a call to her husband, who is on a ventilator) alternate with scenes of resilience: a Zoom birthday, a stoop meet-up, an impromptu street concert. It is a piercing reminder to anyone who was in the city at that time of just how bizarre things were. —A.D. Pope.L began crawling urban streets in 1978, and though much of his work was made in the 20th century, his influence grew wider after the turn of the millennium. He was overlooked before in part because his public performances were easy to read as regular New York nonsense—and because the art world was not yet ready for his abjection, his pranks, or his Blackness. For this particular Crawl, he shimmied up the entire length of Broadway, going at it in chunks over the course of nine years. And he did so alone, on elbows and knees in a Superman suit. The cartoon-reference humor was strategic: in New York, a Black man on the ground is too likely to be ignored. Pope.L refuted this with a Superman suit that screamed: Look at me. —E.W. To experience this work by Sondra Perry, one must climb onto an upright stationary exercise bicycle, thereby experiencing a degree of discomfort. And discomfort is the point, as Perry’s digitally produced avatar, appearing on the video screen that replaces the bicycle’s control panel, demonstrates when it asks “How does your body feel inside us?” The avatar is an imperfect simulacrum of Perry: Its movements are stuttering, its voice robotic, its body thinner than the artist’s and hairless. This is not Perry’s fault, the avatar tells us, but the fault of the program that created it, which had no preexisting template for Perry’s body type. Over the course of a 9-minute video, the idea of discomfort is expanded to include the question of whether racial uplift must entail making a Black body a neutral body, a process that the avatar likens to working on an exercise machine with its pedals installed backward and no hex key. “We are not as helpful or Caucasian as we sound,” the Perry avatar says. “We have no safe mode.” —A.D. In 2001 Palestinian artist Emily Jacir, who holds an American passport, asked Palestinians unable to enter to Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, as well as Palestinians in those three places whose movements are restricted, “If I could do anything for you, anywhere in Palestine, what would it be?” For the next six months, she did her best to fulfill their requests, documenting her attempts in text and photos. One man asked her to visit his mother; another asked for a photo of his family (they gave her strawberries and lemons grown on their land to take back to him). A third asked her to pick an orange in Jericho and eat it (this, she was unable to do). About this piece, the late Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said wrote, “[Jacir’s] compositions slip though the nets of bureaucracies and nonnegotiable borders, time and space, in search not of grandiose dreams or clotted fantasies, but rather of humdrum objects and simple gestures like visits, hugs, watering a tree, eating a meal—the kinds of things that maybe all Palestinians will be able to do someday.” —A.D. Many artists this century grappled with how painting for its own sake is seen as a Western construct, with Frieda Toranzo Jaeger’s contribution being among the most articulate. In altarpiece-style works with panels on hinges, she renders her subjects in a manner that appears amateurish; she then hires family members to embroider her surfaces using a traditional Mexican technique. Here, her altarpiece format approximates the shape of a Tesla, a subject Toranzo Jaeger took on after noticing that many fellow Indigenous artists were at work to preserve history in the face of erasure. She wanted to supplement these efforts by ensuring that Indigenous imaginations had a voice in visions of the future, and indeed, her Musk mockery would prove prophetic. In the background of her painting, a mansion standing in for the old world order is on fire; in the foreground, a fast car promises both a getaway and an intimate interior, or a private reprieve. —E.W. When Julia Child’s cooking show aired on TV, her network briefly experimented with open rather than closed captions, meaning they could not be turned on and off. Lazard, a disabled artist, picks up here, remixing an episode of Child’s show but taking its commitment to access one step further. Child already describes her actions, since the show is didactic. But where the captions fail to describe sound (only dialogue) and Child’s monologue neglects the scenery (only directions), Lazard fills in the gaps, looping in D/deaf and blind audiences. All this quickly accumulates into cacophony, which Lazard embraces. The crescendo, narrated by artist Constantina Zavitsanos, is a manifesto overlaying it all. Lazard revealed the limits of treating access as an afterthought; other artists—Zavitsanos among them—followed, making work that Geelia Ronkina dubbed “access materiality.” A movement was born, centered around works taking up captions, ramps, image descriptions, and so on as a medium—all recently chronicled in The Agency of Access, a book by art historian Amanda Cachia. —E.W. For several centuries in the West, history painting was considered the highest form of art-making. Yet its scope was narrow, leaving so much history always overlooked. Artists like Marakatt-Labba revisited the genre in the 21st century, filling gaps by depicting histories that had not yet been told widely. Historjá is a 77-foot-long embroidered epic that translates the tradition into fiber, and ambitiously aims to depict the whole of the Sámi people’s history: their Nordic Indigenous lore, rituals, prosperity, and oppression rendered scene-by-scene via spare tableaux stitched into linen in a manner not unlike the canonical Bayeux tapestry. Refuting any narrative of progress that might posit modernism over Indigeneity, it begins and ends in a forest, whence the Sámi came. —A.G. The 7th Havana Biennial, at which Tania Bruguera’s Untitled (Havana, 2000) debuted, invited artists to explore mass communication in the new millennium. But rather than a great connector, Bruguera framed communication as a tool for exploitation in Cuba. Bruguera’s work comprised fermenting sugarcane piled several inches high in a darkened tunnel in the Cabaña fortress, a military bunker once used to jail prisoners of conscience. At the end of the space was its sole illumination: a small television monitor suspended from the ceiling that played footage of Fidel Castro, who was still in power at the time. Only as they approached the monitor could visitors notice several nude male performers fiercely rubbing their hands together. The piece spoke to all that lay at the limits of vision in Cuba, a country whose repressive leadership has long tried to keep dissent out of sight, out of mind. Untitled (Havana, 2000) didn’t stay on view long—it was shut down by authorities hours after going up—but it was enough to spur on many dissident Cuban artists after Bruguera. —T.S. Cremaster 3 is a strong candidate for the best movie ever about lamb-eating giants, balletically crashing cars, and Richard Serra flinging molten petroleum jelly inside one of our most august sanctuaries for the appreciation and narrativization of art. The longest feature film in a five-part cycle and the last to be released, the 3-hour fantasia plays as a sort of wordless cinematic tone poem filled with considerations of human evolution and reproduction (the “cremaster” muscle controls male testicles, and figures in the sexual differentiation of an embryo) and interconnected allusions to Matthew Barney’s expansive artistic universe. Starkly divergent vignettes vary from mysterious happenings within New York’s iconic Chrysler Building (the site of a surreal staging of six automobiles smashing into one another, over and over again) to an extravagant set piece in the Guggenheim Museum’s famous rotunda that features Busby Berkeley–style dancing, a hardcore-punk battle of the bands, and Barney himself climbing up and down the walls while interacting with a spectral woman who changes form into a cheetah. While it’s far from easy to apprehend, the film proves transfixing in its elusive and hyper-imaginative flights of fancy. —A.B. For an ambitious undergraduate senior thesis, Shvarts artificially inseminated herself each month for nine months—a routine she followed up with an herbal abortifacient. Her work highlighted the uncertainty that accompanies having a body, especially one that can become pregnant, and it drew attention to those womanly experiences that can be traumatic and ordinary at the same time. Each month, she would bleed heavily, not knowing whether the blood signaled a period, a miscarriage, or an early-stage abortion. Shvarts’s interventions lay bare the ways that bodies rub up against ideologies, existing in ways for which we often lack the language or knowledge to express. Or so argued Harvard art historian Carrie Lambert-Beatty in her 2009 October article defending the young artist, who’d been subjected to vitriol, even death threats. —E.W. For a show at Kunsthalle Portikus, located on a small island in Frankfurt, Germany, Raza rerouted the Main River so that it ran right through the museum. He didn’t stop there: inside, he filtered the water through a very fine coffee filter, then boiled it and added some minerals. Suddenly, the hydrologist-approved water was drinkable; guests were offered glasses of it. It was at once a mind-blowing feat and an extremely simple gesture. Beyond that, Diversion was galvanizing for the way it made survival and reconnecting with nature seem well within reach. —E.W. In 2001, a shocking item appeared in eBay’s “Black Americana” category: an object that was labeled “Keith Obadike’s Blackness (Item #117601036).” It came with an opening bid of just $10 and a list of potential benefits and warnings, including one that read: “The Seller does not recommend that this Blackness be used in the process of making or selling ‘serious’ art.” In placing the work for sale on eBay, the Obadikes drew a connection between the history of enslavement, the auction block, and the website’s “Black Americana” category. The listing did not last long: eBay removed it after four days, by which point bidding had risen to $152.50. Yet Blackness for Sale has had a more enduring legacy, serving as an important intervention in the history of net.art, which had until then mostly avoided discussions about race. In doing so, the work prefigured later conversations around Blackness on the internet. —M.D. The practice of quipu-making comes from pre-Columbian Peru, wherein various Andean peoples tied cords and colorful strands into knots to record events, information, and stories. For decades, Cecilia Vicuña has been making sculptural works that bring this age-old format into the present day, often with a feminist undercurrent. This work, one of the biggest pieces in the “Red Thread” series, was made for Documenta 14. Vicuña created 52 red wool strands, or chorros, and suspended them in a circular ring that hangs from the ceiling. The cascade of red fiber recalls the tenuous nature of life itself, bringing to mind flows of blood that result from wounds and menstruation; from certain angles, her wool forms even look like umbilical cords. Vicuña powerfully connects Indigenous modes of communication and feminine wisdom, suggesting that there are forms of knowledge that exist beyond history books and archives. —F.A. For a formative show at Essex Street Gallery in New York (now Maxwell Graham), McArthur gathered 20 ramps, most of which had been improvised to accommodate the artist, a wheelchair user, during her visits to otherwise inaccessible art spaces between 2010 and 2013. The makeshift ramps were made of materials including plywood boards, a cupboard door, and handmade wedges. The show took place more than 20 years after the Americans with Disabilities Act was signed into law, and highlighted both the inaccessible entrances that still punctuated McArthur’s every day and the caring improvisation that ensued. But it was more than an autobiographical show or a complaint about lack of compliance, with McArthur’s most crucial gesture easy to miss: Printed on one wall was the URL for the Wikipedia page McArthur built for Marta Russell, a disabled activist who wrote Beyond Ramps (1998), a book arguing that certain American economic policies are greater threats to the quality of disabled life than impairment itself. McArthur shined a spotlight on how disability is politically constructed, and a whole artistic movement took off in the wake. —E.W. Vertigo Sea seems to take place in the past, present, and future simultaneously, clocks ticking throughout the duration of this arresting three-screen video. Archival oceanic images of whales, seals, and enslaved people recur alongside newer shots of people in 19th-century European garb pondering cloud-covered landscapes. The soundtrack features quotations from the abolitionist Olaudah Equiano and novelist Herman Melville alongside other musings on the ocean, ranging from maritime disasters during the transatlantic slave trade to rising sea levels now and in the future. This haunted 48-minute installation can feel too intense to bear as interwoven historical strands accrete. Akomfrah presents history as an unstable narrative, filled with bits and pieces that get dispersed, reassembled, and reshaped in the wake of so much death and destruction. Conventional senses of time and chronology offer no aid in wading through the roiled waters of history. —A.G. No material is more elemental than earth, which Colombian artist Delcy Morelos enlisted to alternately exhilarating and disquieting effect with El abrazo, an enormous arrangement of dirt (or, more properly, a mix of clay and soil laced with hay and coir) that filled a building in the Chelsea gallery district of New York. Commissioned by the Dia Art Foundation, the work was a sort of counterpoint to Walter De Maria’s New York Earth Room—another Dia installation that is basically the soil-filled floor of a building in Soho on view since 1977. But its purview ventured into more worldly, even cosmological, terrain in the way it channeled Andean, Amazonian, and many other belief systems that have been cultivated through the ages. El abrazo was also a rare artwork that granted permission to touch: as Morelos stated in a brochure, “Let the hands listen, see the smell of the earth with the fingertips, let its taste be savored by the skin.” And then, at the end: “To touch the earth is to be touched by her.” —A.B. During the late 2000s, beer gardens became a familiar motif in works by Nicole Eisenman, who sought to vividly evoke contemporary society; this one is her most poignant. Overtly modeled on Renoir’s Bal du moulin de la Galette, the painting updates that famous tableau for modern times. Eisenman masterfully throws art history into a blender, evoking Impressionism, Expressionism (channeling Munch in particular), and contemporary cartoons all at once. The forlorn tank-topped figure in the foreground, fiddling with his BlackBerry while gazing vacantly at the viewer, is a subtle reminder of the backdrop of this gathering: a global recession. Thus, the painting recognizably belongs to a specific time and place, and fulfills Eisenman’s goal of creating art that belongs distinctly to the present. —S.D. Airport blueprints from around the world form the basis of this 20-foot-wide abstract painting. The emphasis on travel appears biographical: Julie Mehretu and her family fled political instability in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and wound up in East Lansing, Michigan, and the artist is now based in New York. But, ultimately, almost everyone is migratory now, and the painting is an apt reflection of our time. The painting is engrossing up close—its intricate marks draw the eye in—but from afar, the work appears even more resonant. Its dramatic scale mimics the sheer vastness of our world, which seemed to grow ever wider as the economy became more global during the 2000s. —F.A. At the start of this video, nearly all the foul-mouthed, catty protagonists seem to be named Jenny. By the end, they take on other aliases. The fka-Jennys film each other, partake in dance-offs, lob insults, and drunkenly run through chroma-key green halls. Along the way, these characters paint their faces in tones ranging from pewter to green, don wigs, sport fake facial hair, and apply garish makeup. Like all Ryan Trecartin’s videos, Center Jenny epitomizes the frenetic pace and glut of options the internet enabled, emblematizing how people began to adopt personas as they broadcast themselves to the world. No surprise that most TikToks now look a lot like this video, with its chatterbox youths, cacophonous soundtrack, and twitchy editing style. —A.G. The water crisis in the majority-Black Michigan city Flint began in 2014 and remains ongoing. That year, the water source for locals was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River, whose contaminated flow was soon consumed as drinking water. The community was forever altered by resulting illnesses and death. To offer visual evidence of all the destruction, photographer LaToya Ruby Frazier documented the lives of those impacted by the crisis. The resulting photographs were not only touching and deeply personal but also doubled as a means of exposing environmental injustice. Initially released as a photobook, this series showed that documentary photography need not be either objective or impersonal, plotting a fresh path for this 20th-century genre in a new era. —F.A. For her breakout show at the Kitchen in New York, Yi swabbed DNA from 100 women in the art world and mixed all the samples together. Working with synthetic biologist Tal Danino, Yi installed the bacteria in a glass vitrine, where it bloomed to spell out the titular phrase. The show ushered in a whole new generation of bio art, work that involves using living material as a medium. But unlike the bio art of yore, exemplified by Eduardo Kac’s glowing green bunny, this new wave drew less from synthetic biology and resisted dominating nature. Rather, the bio art Yi heralded reveals and reveres the dense networks of organisms that we depend on to survive. You Can Call Me F melds this idea with a feminist critique of the lone genius, highlighting the support network behind the artist. —E.W. Eight hands draw crooked lines that connect disparate countries. Eight disaffected voices narrate tumultuous journeys—across seas, through cities, into and out of refugee camps. Eight hanging screens feature unbroken takes of hands running markers across maps. Such are the elements of Bouchra Khalili’s Mapping Journey Project, a video installation that concisely highlights the geographic (and bureaucratic) barriers faced by people who left their homelands for new lives in Europe. Khalili captures the difficulties of these voyages, as well as the long-term impact of the pain experienced along the way, playing recorded testimonials from migrants in European cities. Khalili asked all her interviewees to draw using permanent markers, their lines lingering forever on the artist’s maps, like scars running under vast oceans and across mountain ranges. —A.G. What happens when music becomes a weapon of war? This video offers one answer. Here, Tony Cokes draws on the accounts of Iraqi and Afghan civilians who endured a form of torture that involved playing American tunes at a deafening volume. Chart-topping hits from the likes of Eminem and Britney Spears, Metallica and Bruce Springsteen roared as text excerpts from “Disco Inferno,” Moustafa Bayoumi’s 2005 article from the Nation flashed by, slideshow-style. “Disco isn’t dead,” the video informs us at one point. “It has gone to war.” Cokes shows that mainstream music—heard daily on the radio, where it seems so innocuous—can be used as a weapon, a form of psychological manipulation, and a means of American imperialism all in one. —F.A. The task of choosing one Deana Lawson work was excruciating. Unlike most photographers, whose sensibilities are best portrayed through whole projects rather than single images, nearly every Lawson photo holds its own, triumphant in scale and offering lots to look at. Here, as in most of her portraits of Black people in domestic interiors, you are left to wonder what of it is staged. Lace curtains sag awkwardly and seem candid, yet our subject is dressed up in a satin gown with a hole in the front, where her pregnant bare belly protrudes. The outfit is clearly a choice—hardly what one expects in a photo of a person at home—yet its significance is elusive. As ever, Lawson might get you to believe at first that you are seeing an intimate scene. But incongruous details—wearing heels in bed, posters hung upside down—make it clear the setup is contrived, reminding just how little you can know of a person from a picture. —E.W. Maria Eichhorn lent the phrase “paid time off” new meaning with this piece, for which she shuttered London’s Chisenhale Gallery for the time span noted in the work’s title. Employees were directed not to answer phones, not to reply to most of their emails, and not to report to work at all. Instead, Chisenhale’s staff was given five weeks of free time with pay. Meanwhile, the gallery remained shuttered to the public; all there was to see was a sign with a short text that explained the staff was “not working.” The piece was a salient reminder that any artwork exhibited is indebted to the labor of others. —A.G. Rare are the gestures profoundly poetic and political at once, affecting and effecting without compromising one for the other. Mirror Shield Project is among the finest such examples. Luger, a member of the Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, was born on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, whose name made headlines during the 2016 #NoDAPL movement protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline, which was scheduled to run through sacred land and disrupt water supply. Inspired by civil unrest that unfolded in Ukraine, Luger made a video showing masses how to construct DIY mirrored shields from simple materials. Protesters arrived in droves, holding the mirror shields up against officials in riot gear, building a barrier while inviting those on the other side to reflect. —E.W. The Atlas Group is credited with numerous artworks concerning the 1975–90 Lebanese Civil Wars. Often, these are detailed and painstakingly comprehensive research-based works: a journal tracking every car bomb detonated during the conflict, photographs of bullet-hole-pocked buildings overlaid with color-coded dots that correspond to different types of ammunition, clues to who fired the shots. The Atlas Group, though, was mostly the work of a single artist: a carefully crafted persona named so that you might trust its authority; the Group is an artwork unto itself. You might wonder how an artist could gather data this definitive or, perhaps, how anyone could. It takes only a mildly studious eye to catch the farce: the date of the group’s origin varies in different shows. The Atlas Group parodied the absurdism in claims to comprehension, and pointed to how facts and data can be hardest to procure when they are most urgent, most politicized. This may seem more obvious today than when the project began, but it isn’t any less essential. —E.W. Over the past 35 years, Andrea Fraser has critiqued the systems and structures of the art world, offering biting commentary on its pretensions and class distinctions largely through venturesome video performances. In Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989), she passed herself off as a docent at the Philadelphia Museum, flummoxing visitors with an unhinged commentary on the institution and its history as well as social and political issues. More notoriously, in Untitled (2003), she videotaped herself having sex with the anonymous art collector to whom she presold the piece, literalizing the blurred lines between personal and financial relationships in the art business. In this video from 2001, Fraser takes on the Guggenheim Bilbao and its audio guide extolling the glories of the Frank Gehry–designed museum building. Fraser pantomimes exaggerated responses to the guide’s litany of wonders, until, prompted to stroke one of the museum’s pillars, she lifts her skirt and ecstatically rubs herself against it. “Critique,” Fraser told ARTnews in 2016, “at its best is a verb.” —A.D. Simone Leigh won the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale in 2022 for this sculpture, a 16-foot-tall, 5,900-pound bronze bust. The work originally presided over the High Line in New York City; it is part of a larger series by Leigh in which female forms fuse with historical and contemporary signifiers of Africa and the African diaspora. Here, cowrie shells, a reference to a material used widely in African art, adorn the figure’s cornrows; its skirt honors the architectural traditions of Benin, Togo, Chad, and Cameroon, among others. Few of these references were made plain to viewers, however—if they knew, they knew, and if they weren’t curious, they wouldn’t learn. Brick House evinced a kind of withholding that was widely seen in art of the past decade, rarely with such grace as in Leigh’s sculpture. —T.S. Technically, this piece had a mouthful for a full title: “the Marvelous Sugar Baby an Homage to the unpaid and overworked Artisans who have refined our Sweet tastes from the cane fields to the Kitchens of the New World on the Occasion of the demolition of the Domino Sugar Refining Plant.” Certainly, with this sculpture, Kara Walker gave those artisans their due. It was with this piece that Walker, who had become known for her work in silhouetted paper cutouts that told harrowing stories of enslavement, made a radical shift in scale to the monumental. Drawing on the history of labor in sugar processing, and leaning heavily into the metaphor of its refinement (bleaching from brown to white), Walker created an object that may have tasted sweet but smelled acrid and looked formidable, almost menacing. A sphinx sculpture made from 160,000 pounds of sugar, it was a great artwork—and a controversial one too, many claiming that its highly sexualized representation of a Black woman worked to no end. Like it or not, however, it was a statement of intent from an artist who was just 44 at the time. Walker went on to make other enormous pieces, including a fountain shown at the Turbine Hall at Tate Modern, and remains a force to be reckoned with. —S.D. It was one of those experiences that was so cool you couldn’t believe you got to be part of it. Ace Gallery had a cavernous space in downtown Manhattan, and for this work, it was kept pitch-dark. You were given a little blue penlight and permission to navigate. Here and there, you’d see other blue pinpricks of light—other humans!—but the light was not quite enough to fully illuminate them. There were almost no other objects in the space. By the time he made this piece, David Hammons was already a master of audience participation or, put another way, audience provocation, Exhibit A being a 1983 piece in which he sold snowballs on the sidewalk in New York’s East Village. This work, though, was stranger and more subtle, made during a time—just after 9/11, just after anthrax in the mail—when, in New York, it felt as if we were all fumbling in the dark, wondering what would next happen, what kind of world we lived in, even who among us was safe and who might pose us harm. This Century artwork list was being compiled long before Hauser & Wirth decided to re-create Hammons’s Concerto in Black and Blue at its LA gallery during Frieze Los Angeles this past February; the gallery did well to do so. —S.D. For the 2003 Istanbul Biennial, Doris Salcedo piled 1,550 wooden chairs in a gap between two buildings in the city’s center. Rising almost three stories, the chairs pressed right up against the edge of the sidewalk. The work built upon one made the year prior, in which Salcedo lowered dozens of chairs from the roof of Bogotá’s Palace of Justice to commemorate a siege there. In Istanbul, the historical reference point was more ambiguous, hinting at the city’s history of migration and displacement while also speaking to a desire to “represent war in general” and create a “topography of war,” as Salcedo once said. The totality of this work, in both its location and size, made it hard to miss, a reminder that these histories and the people they affect can be overwhelming when made manifest. —M.D. Sometimes, masterpieces create monsters. So it was for Harun Farocki, whose style of essay film many have emulated, few successfully. The late German filmmaker was deft at exposing the industry of images, and at revealing various systems of power often hidden in plain sight. Eye/Machine I is the first video in a trilogy, and it highlights footage that is more data than aesthetic, with blurry clips of airports unintelligible to the untrained eye. It opens with found footage—aerial surveillance collected by the US in 1991, during the war on Iraq—and features an unseen narrator calling such pictures “devoid of social intent.” Yet Farocki masters the art of show, don’t tell, with Eye/Machine’s narrator intervening strategically, decrypting only the images that are illegible to the human eye. As for the rest, he lets you see for yourself. —E.W. With this piece staged for the Mexican Pavilion at the Venice Biennale, Teresa Margolles transformed the grisly residue of death into art. Known for addressing violence fueled by Mexico’s narcotics trade, Margolles here used materials like bloodstained cloths and shattered glass to expose the human cost of systemic inequities. The piece included fabric soaked in blood from murder sites, along with an accompanying performance that impressively—and grotesquely—involved a man mopping the floor with fluid from the dead acquired from morgues in Mexico. For even greater effect, Margolles distributed cards that doubled as cocaine cutters, suggesting that global consumer culture itself was complicit in sustaining the very carnage she highlighted. It was all unsettling and deeply uncomfortable because it offered material proof of violence that is sometimes tough to see. —D.C. I probably watched Grosse Fatigue in its entirety three times during the 2013 Venice Biennale (curated by Massimiliano Gioni), and with every viewing, new elements of the piece came to the fore. Against a techno/jazz beat by Joakim Bouaziz, artist Akwetey Orraca-Tetteh recites a poem written by Henrot and poet Jacob Bromberg that begins with the first words of the Bible: “In the beginning…” We start on a computer home screen, from which blossoms a mesmerizing bouquet of images. It is impossible to catalog them: snippets of old master paintings, a copy of The Origin of Species next to a Charles Darwin bobblehead, a fish head, a sculpture of an ancient god. (Much of the imagery came from objects Henrot encountered during a residency at the Smithsonian Institution.) What is most striking about the piece is the way it seems to echo the process each of us goes through every day in our digital age in our attempts to make sense of an image-saturated world, to create some kind of narrative out of chaos. In an art world that was going increasingly online (remember all those articles about art on Instagram?), Henrot’s work struck just the right chord. It still does. —S.D. Time flies when you’re having fun watching time—or so it seems when in the thrall of The Clock, a 24-hour assemblage of found footage starring timepieces of different kinds from the past century of film and TV. Drawing on his legacy as a maestro of remix culture (both musical and other), Christian Marclay spent three years combing the annals of moving-image history for brief clips he sequenced together. The result is a cinematic collage made up of appropriated scenes of actors glancing at their watches or waiting for seconds and minutes to tick down on clocks, alarms, and more. Each scene corresponds with the progression of a full day, so that the times in the clips sync up with the points at which they appear in Marclay’s work. While The Clock is an organizational and technical marvel (how did he find the thousands of clips, and how did he piece them all together?), the experience of watching the work as a movie of its own is just as awe-inspiring as the process. Taking stock of time manages to capture the essence of suspense and turn it inside out, leaving a viewer to wonder what it is about viewing that can leave us so rapt. —A.B. This sculpture appears innocuous, as though merely a simple metal corner desk. But a text provided by the artist reveals that it was produced by inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility in New York, who at the time were given hourly rates between $0.16 and $1.25. Rowland was working within the tradition of the readymade sculpture, but unlike Marcel Duchamp and his ilk, the artist was questioning more than artistic authorship, showing instead that everyday objects such as desks could unfurl knotty, horrifying histories of systemic exploitation. When the work was initially exhibited at New York’s Artists Space, it was no coincidence that the desk might have been mistaken for a staffer’s workstation. It was a reminder that objects produced through systems of underpaid, even forced, labor are just about everywhere. —A.G. With a series of essays and videos produced during the early 2010s, Hito Steyerl became the greatest observer of the state of total visibility brought on by the internet and rampant surveillance. Is it possible not to be seen today? Steyerl’s 2013 magnum opus asked that question, then offered a few tips, some practical, others absurdist—like “being female and over 50.” The video demystifies optical engineering by the US Air Force, green-screen technology, and more, all in 15 minutes, so as to suggest that in the age of image overload, none of us will escape becoming pixels to be played with. Her attempts to escape feel comically futile: in one memorable sequence, she smears her face with green paint, revealing color charts that were added in post-production. She goes invisible, becoming a part of the digital ether. —A.G. Completed the year before Kerry James Marshall’s midcareer retrospective at the Met, which went on to acquire this work, Untitled (Studio) exemplifies the noun referenced in the intentionally misspelled title of that show, “Mastry.” There is mastery in the whole, and in all its glorious parts: the crisply modeled dog, the bouquet out of an old master painting, the drapery, the paintbrushes, that Tiepolo sky glimpsed through a window, the uncompleted canvas on an easel, passages of which, viewed up close, can read as pure abstraction. And that is to say nothing of its subject. Here, Marshall took on a scene that to date had mainly been the province of white artists: the studio. He stepped into the pantheon of Matisse, Courbet, and their ilk, inserting and asserting the Black artist as a protagonist in art history. It’s the kind of painting that makes you say to yourself: OK, now he’s just showing off! Shouldn’t he be allowed to do just that? —S.D. Adrian Piper’s conceptual art of the 20th century may have made a bigger mark on art history, but this video is significant for the way it throws all that work into sharp relief. The artist is known for pointed work that tackles serious subjects, from racial inequity to transcendental philosophy. But her sensibility was often playful and irreverent, even when her work was sharp and intense, and this video makes that much obvious. It shows Piper dancing improvisationally in Berlin’s Alexanderplatz, the center of the city she has called home since fleeing the US in 2006. Piper dances for an hour, and she dances quite well, accompanied by 2000s Berlin house music. This is an artist who sees the world’s evils as clearly as she does its joys. —E.W. A scorching sun; Notorious B.I.G. rapping; Martin Luther King Jr. riding in a car; police committing violence; protests raging for civil rights and Black Lives Matter; Barack Obama grieving the victims of the Charleston church shooting; Mahalia Jackson performing. These are among the memorable clips packed into this video, which aspires to distill the rich range of Black experience in the US into just seven minutes. Working from his extensive archive of other peoples’ pictures, Arthur Jafa offered a full gamut of experiences from death to celebration, at a time when footage of Black Americans dying violent deaths at the hands of police proliferated in the media. Set to Kanye West’s “Ultralight Beam,” Jafa’s video is a sublime artwork that teeters between abject horror and bona fide beauty. Its final image is tough to shake: a clip of James Brown performing his ecstatic music until he collapses. —A.G. Get our latest stories in the feed of your favorite networks We want to hear from you!

Full Content:
UPDATED 20:07 EST / MARCH 04 2025 by Mike Wheatley Cloud-based artificial intelligence infrastructure startup CoreWeave Inc. today announced it plans to buy the AI model development firm Weights & Biases Inc. for an undisclosed price. The company confirmed the acquisition plan just minutes after The Information first reported that it was “in talks” to buy Weights & Biases in a deal valued at $1.7 billion. CoreWeave has emerged as one of the AI industry’s hottest properties because it provides enterprises with access to that most treasured resource: the graphics processing units that power today’s AI services. Through its cloud infrastructure, enterprise customers such as Meta Platforms Inc. can obtain on-demand access to some of Nvidia’s most powerful GPUs, including its H100 and H200 chips, which are designed to provide accelerated computing power for large language models and other AI workloads. San Francisco-based Weights & Biases, which had raised more than $250 million in funding from investors since its founding in 2017, has built a platform that promises to speed up the development of AI models. It provides extensive capabilities to AI developers, including tools for managing training datasets, testing how changes to a model affect its performance, and troubleshooting technical problems. In addition, Weights & Biases offers more specialized capabilities, including a set of features for fixing so-called “hallucinations,” or erroneous responses that are sometimes generated by large language models. Its platform has proved to be a major hit, and the company claims it’s being used by more than 1 million AI engineers, including some from enterprises such as OpenAI, Meta, Nvidia Corp., Snowflake Inc. and Toyota Motor Co. CoreWeave said it will integrate Weights & Biases’ capabilities into its cloud infrastructure platform in order to give customers a more comprehensive “end-to-end” AI experience. Not only will they be able to run their models in its cloud, they’ll also be able to build and test their own. Collectively, the two companies aim to help customers accelerate their AI roadmaps and bring new applications to market faster. It promised that Weights & Biases’ existing customers will continue to be allowed to deploy their AI models wherever they like, meaning they won’t be forced onto its cloud infrastructure – though they’ll likely be “encouraged” to consider it. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. told SiliconANGLE that CoreWeave’s management has recognized that many enterprises prefer to buy a complete AI solution that can simplify their forays into AI application and model development, housing everything under one roof. “They want a turnkey cloud platform that lets them build and operate their next-generation AI applications and do everything associated with them in one place, and that’s what CoreWeave aims to give them,” he said. CoreWeave co-founder and Chief Executive Michael Intrator described Weights & Biases as a “phenomenal platform” that helps companies of any size to get a handle on the complexities of building AI models, deploying them and monitoring their performance. “Together with CoreWeave, we will bring this grit and passion for innovation to customers at an even greater scale, with the goal of rapidly accelerating adoption across the world’s leading AI labs and enterprises,” promised Weights & Biases CEO Lukas Biewald. The acquisition is subject to “customary closing conditions” and is expected to be finalized in the first half of the year. Assuming it does go ahead as planned, it will bring an even greater sense of urgency to CoreWeave’s plan to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange later this year. Only yesterday, the company revealed it had filed the necessary paperwork for its initial public offering, saying it intends to trade on the Nasdaq exchange under the “CRWV” ticker symbol. CoreWeave’s IPO filing revealed that the company has seen dramatic growth over the last year, with its revenue rising by a stunning 700%, to $1.92 billion, in fiscal 2024. It’s expecting to grow even faster in the future, too, with more than $15 billion in signed contracts that it has yet to fulfill. The company remains unprofitable, though, posting a loss of $863.4 million that year.

Title: GOP Is ‘Trying to Gaslight’ Americans Into Believing Trump Has Made Their Lives Better, Tara Setmayer Says | Video

“I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for,” the former GOP comms director adds Tara Setmayer thinks the GOP is doing a lot of gaslighting to keep the American people convinced President Donald Trump is making their lives better. In the wake of Trump’s renewed push to place major tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the stock market took a hit and prices around the U.S. continued to increase. Setmayer – a former communications director for the GOP – explained that the party is having to cover for the president’s choices with a lot of gaslighting for promises made before the election. Watch her breakdown while on MSNBC Tuesday below: “I think the Republicans are going to have to explain to the American people why Donald Trump’s actions so far in his few weeks that he’s been in office, how has that improved their lives?” Setmayer said. “It hasn’t and no matter what they keep saying, they’re trying to gaslight the American people into thinking everything’s better. ‘This is much better — you’re going to have to go through some pain but it will be better eventually.’ I don’t think that’s what the American people voted for.” She continued: “They didn’t hear about that ‘some pain’ part first in order to get this magical better economic situation. The economic situation was actually pretty good under Joe Biden, but a lot of the American people didn’t feel it.” The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. Big tech has been hit especially hard since Trump took office – ironic since many of them were prominently displayed behind him on Inauguration Day. Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, all who were represented at Trump’s swearing in, have seen their shares take a sizable hit since 2025 began. Only Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta has enjoyed a price climb so far.

Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA-6.02%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+4.39%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL-0.41%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT-1.25%), Google (GOOGL-0.55%), Meta (META-4.53%) or Amazon (AMZN-4.34%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA-5.49%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR-10.49%), Salesforce (CRM-2.21%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Big Tech Stocks Down Big as Wall Street Hit Hard in Wake of Trump’s Tariffs

Four of the five major tech companies represented at President Trump’s inauguration have seen their share prices decline in 2025, including Tesla, which has taken a 30% hit If, after seeing a who’s who of Silicon Valley executives at President Trump’s inauguration in January, you believed it was going to be the Year of Big Tech, you’d be wrong — at least so far. Instead, four of the five major tech companies represented at the inauguration — Amazon, Apple, Tesla and Alphabet, Google’s parent company — have seen their share prices take a noticeable hit to start 2025. Only Meta, who was represented by CEO Mark Zuckerberg, has seen its share price climb this year. Here’s how those companies have performed on Wall Street since the start of the year, by mid-morning on Tuesday: — Meta: up 4.7% — Apple: down 1.9% — Amazon: down 9.6% — Alphabet: down 11.8% — Tesla: down 30% Tesla, as seen above, has been particularly hard-hit in 2025. CEO Elon Musk has been spearheading the Department of Government Efficiency for President Trump, as both are aiming to cut at least $1 trillion from the federal bureaucracy. Musk’s time spent away from his electric car company has upset some investors, who are calling for him to spend more time on Tesla and less time on DOGE. Reports of softening sales in China have not helped, either, although Tesla bulls are pointing to revamped models, the expansion of its self-driving technology and the launch of its $20,000 Optimus robots as reasons to be optimistic. From a macro standpoint, the market has taken a downturn recently, with many analysts saying the tariffs imposed by President Trump have been a key driver of the dip. The Nasdaq, Dow Jones and S&P 500 were all down about 2% on Tuesday, a day after the president said he would be imposing tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico. The Wall Street slide for the major tech companies stands out, after Musk, Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet chief Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos literally stood behind the president on Jan. 20 in Washington, D.C. Many Trump fans who attended the inauguration told TheWrap they were skeptical of Big Tech’s sudden embrace of Trump, aside from Musk, whom the crowd overwhelmingly seemed to like. Now, it will be worth watching to see if investors remain skeptical of the market, or if they are “buying the dip” on these Big Tech stocks.

Title: Stocks fall in early trading as Trump tariffs take effect

The Trump administration's long-promised tariffs took hold on Tuesday. U.S. stocks tumbled on Tuesday after the Trump administration’s long-promised tariffs took effect. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 670 points, or 1.5%; while the S&P 500 fell 1.2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ticked down 0.3%. The policy taxes imports from Mexico, Canada and China -- the three largest trading partners of the United States -- meaning that it could raise prices for everything from gasoline to avocados to iPhones. Shares of retail giant Target fell 3% on Tuesday, following an earnings release from the company that cited "tariff uncertainty" as a potential impediment for the business. Walmart's stock price dipped about 2.5% on Tuesday, while Amazon shares inched down 0.6%. Shares of Best Buy plummeted more than 13%. The sharp drop came after Best Buy CEO told analysts that price increases are "highly likely" as a result of the tariffs. Higher costs for car production could also pose a challenge for U.S. automakers, many of which depend on a supply chain closely intertwined with Mexico and Canada. Shares of Ford tumbled nearly 3% on Tuesday, while General Motors dropped about 4.5%. Stellantis -- the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler -- saw shares decline more than 4%. Tesla, the electric carmaker led by Elon Musk, saw its stock price drop about 4.5%. The far-reaching losses extend a market slide that began on Monday afternoon when Trump affirmed plans to impose a fresh round of tariffs. Trump stuck to a March 4 start date for 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, as well as 10% tariff on Chinese goods -- which, as of Tuesday, rises to 20%, per an amended executive order. Tariffs of this magnitude would likely increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers, experts said. The duties also raise input costs for manufacturers that import raw materials. In addition to Tesla and Amazon, the tariffs appeared to impact some of the other so-called "Magnificent Seven," a group of large tech firms that helped drive stock market gains in recent years. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, suffered a 2% drop in its stock price. Apple, which makes some of its products in China, fell nearly 1%. Shares of Microsoft defied the trend, however, remaining essentially unchanged on Tuesday. Chipmaker Nvidia, which relies on semiconductors from Taiwan but also imports some materials from Mexico, saw shares increase about 1.5%. Alphabet's stock price climbed about 2%.

Title: Ray-Ban and Meta just teased new limited-edition smart glasses – but they'll be in frustratingly short supply

Ray-Ban and Meta have another 3,600 pairs of clear specs on the way When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has announced that new “limited-edition Ray-Ban Meta glasses” are set to land this month, with promo images suggesting they’ll be transparent just like the previous limited-edition design it launched – but expect them to be even harder to get your hands on. Beyond a look at the Ray-Ban logo on a clear-ish frame that shows off the hardware inside the smart specs, we know relatively little about the design. The previous clear frames used the Wayfarer frame type, but this new run could get the Skyler or Headliner design, which have more rounded lenses, although our money is on a bold new design like the frames A$AP Rocky – Ray-Ban’s new Creative Director – just unveiled at Milan Fashion Week – which would tally with the “straight from the runway” comment in Meta’s promotional material for the new limited-edition specs. We also don’t know if these specs will come with the same limited-edition black case as the previous edition, instead of the standard brown, though we hope they do. Adding to the list of unknown is that Meta has yet to reveal a price. Given that the previous limited model cost $429 – which is about $100 more than the standard translucent frames – we expect this new design will also be pricier than standard Ray-Ban smart glasses, and perhaps even pricier than the previous limited design. We say that because while Meta’s last limited run consisted of 7,500 pairs, this time it’s only making 3,600 – at least, that’s what '0001/3600' printed on the frames in the promo image on its website is suggesting. Given the even more limited supply, Meta may choose to bump the price up, so if you’re keen to pick up a pair for yourself you’ll want to act fast when they drop. There's no precise release date to mark on your calendars, though there is a 'Notify me' button on the website if you want to get an update when the glasses go live –just be prepared to go home empty handed. Scalpers are showing that they’re still in full force in 2025 by ruining limited drops for tech, and there’s a good chance they’ll strike again here. There may also be scammers around looking to take advantage of the hype if stock does run dry – so be careful buying glasses claiming to be the limited edition Ray-Bans from unofficial stores and resellers.

Title: Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality: Navigating the New Frontier of ETFs
URL: https://www.mutualfundobserver.com/2025/03/liquid-promises-illiquid-reality-navigating-the-new-frontier-of-etfs/
Time Published: 2025-03-04T00:36:11Z
Full Content:
In the investment world, there’s an old saying: “There’s no such thing as a free lunch.” Yet the latest crop of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offering both daily liquidity and exposure to illiquid assets might seem to promise just that—a financial equivalent of eating decadent cheesecake without gaining an ounce. Alternately: we keep waiting for The Wizard to save us. The investment industry has traditionally maintained strict guardrails between liquid public markets and illiquid private investments. This separation wasn’t arbitrary—it reflected a fundamental reality that illiquid investments, by their very nature, cannot be quickly converted to cash without significant price concessions. Regulations limiting illiquid investments in publicly traded funds weren’t designed to deprive “regular” investors of opportunities, but rather to protect them from risks they might not fully comprehend or be equipped to handle. We’ve been here before. History provides sobering lessons. In some cases, arrogance, overconfidence, and groupthink led to stunning levels of concentration in portfolios. The Fairholme Fund today has 74% of its portfolio in a single company, St. Joe. Bruce Berkowitz was Morningstar manager of the decade for 2000-10 but they dropped coverage of the fund in 2021, giving it a score of 100+ on their risk gauge, and note that its category rank has been either in the top 1% or bottom 1% of its peer group for seven of the past eight years. The Sequoia Fund not only sunk 36% of its portfolio in a single sketchy stock, Valeant Pharmaceuticals, but its public statements began parroting the Valeant CEO’s. We reported “the dark version of the Sequoia narrative” in 2016: Goldfarb, abetted by an analyst, became obsessed about Valeant and crushed any internal dissent. Mr. Poppe, nominally Mr. Goldfarb’s peer, wouldn’t or couldn’t stop the disaster. “All the directors had repeatedly expressed concern” over the size of the Valeant stake and the decision to double down on it. Mr. Poppe dismissed their concerns: “recent events frustrated them.” The subsequent resignations by 40% of the board, with another apparently threatening to go, were inconsequential annoyances. Sequoia, rather snippily, noted that board members don’t control the portfolio, the managers do. Foot firmly on the gas, they turned the bus toward the cliff. More recently our colleague Devesh Shah reported that Texas Public Land Corporation comprised 47% of the total holdings of Horizon Kinetics, advisor to the various Kinetics Funds. (Morningstar subsequently picked up on the story albeit without acknowledging Devesh’s work.) As of 3/1/25, Kinetics Paradigm has 66% of its portfolio in TPL and its sibling Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities sits at 53%. Both have perfectly splendid total returns coupled with Morningstar risk scores of 100+. Freakishly Morningstar has endorsed both, awarding them a Bronze analyst rating. The most spectacular blow-ups have resulted from the confidence that star managers can magically turn illiquid investments into liquid ones. Consider Firsthand Technology Value Fund (SVVC), which offered public investors access to pre-IPO tech companies. What seemed revolutionary quickly turned problematic as the fund frequently traded at substantial discounts to its net asset value (NAV)—sometimes exceeding 30%. Why? Because investors couldn’t be certain of the true value of its holdings, creating a persistent trust deficit. The fund posted annualized losses of 75% over the past three years and 60% over the past five. It now trades at $0.06/share and can’t even manage to liquidate. If you’re interested in the cautionary tale of the giant that tumbled, read “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund” (March 2025). More dramatically, the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund‘s collapse in 2015 demonstrates how quickly illiquidity can transform from theoretical to catastrophic. In 2016, we described it this way: …offered the impossible: it would invest in illiquid securities but provide investors with daily liquidity. That worked fine as long as the market was rising and no one actually wanted their money back, but when the tide began to go out and investors wanted their money, the poop hit the propeller. When redemptions accelerated, the fund couldn’t sell its junk bonds fast enough and ultimately had to bar investors from withdrawing their money—the ultimate liquidity failure. The fund froze redemptions and placed the fund in a locked trust. Investors exploded, and lawsuits followed, as did a $14.25 million payment from two Third Avenue executives. It took investors three years to receive, drip by drop, 84% of their investment back. Third Avenue was gutted. Despite these cautionary tales, a new generation of funds is testing the boundaries: Franklin Global Allocation Fund has ventured into business development companies, a relatively modest step into less-liquid territory. Effective on February 5, 2025, the fund gained the option of investing in business development companies, “BDCs are a less common type of closed-end fund [which] typically invest in small, developing, financially troubled, private companies or other companies that may have value that can be realized over time, often with managerial assistance.” At around the same time, its management team turned over, leading Morningstar to place its status as “under review.” The fund has seen continuous outflows essentially every single month for a decade with annual returns in the 5-7% range. Adding the ability to goose returns with a new asset class makes business sense; adding illiquid assets and a new team is grounds for caution. SPDR SSGA Apollo IG Public & Private Credit ETF pushes further by investing in private credit markets. Described as “ground-breaking” by Morningstar, the ETF will give investors exposure to illiquid private credit in a liquid vehicle. Up to 35% of the portfolio can be illiquid debt. The plan is for the fund to buy private credit from Apollo with the promise the Apollo will also promise to help them cover their … uhh, exposure. Morningstar’s Brian Moriarty explains: The ETF plans to overcome those concerns through a contractual agreement with Apollo, which will supply private-credit assets for the fund to buy and provide it with bids, or prices, on those same assets. Apollo has further agreed to purchase those investments from the fund up to an undefined daily limit. In other words, Apollo is selling these instruments to the fund and promising to buy them back at the request of State Street. (“A Groundbreaking New ETF Arrives,” Morningstar.com, 2/27/25). Pretty much no one but the adviser is sanguine about these promises. Mr. Moriarty frets “If redemptions are greater than Apollo’s daily limit and the ETF has few public securities, there are many more questions that the filing doesn’t answer… the filing makes it clear that ‘assets that were deemed liquid by the Adviser may become illiquid’ if Apollo is unable to provide a bid or unable to purchase those assets.” One day later the SEC belatedly located its Big Boy Pants and told the adviser to file an amended plan. In a letter to the firms, the Securities and Exchange Commission noted that the fund had “significant remaining outstanding issues” around its liquidity, name, and ability to comply with valuation rules. That’s in part because the SEC accepted a filing with key information blacked-out, or redacted. “We have concerns,” associate director Brent Fields announced. (Tania Mitra, “After launch, SEC raises concerns about State Street and Apollo’s private credit ETF,” Citywire, 2/28/25). ERShares Private-Public Crossover (XOVR) makes perhaps the boldest move by including private equity investments like SpaceX and it’s drawn the attention of two really smart, very different people, Jason Zweig and Jeff Ptak. Both start with the same observation: XOVR’s claim to fame is that it owns a chunk of Elon Musk’s company, SpaceX and it markets that fact relentlessly. The biggest question, though, is “How big a chunk do they own?” The honest answer to which is “sheet, I dunno” because SpaceX is privately traded and its price is anybody’s (and sometimes everybody’s) guess. The Wall Street Journal’s Jason Zweig launched on the fund in January, doing what Mr. Z. does best: he gets to the point quickly, clearly, and with great style. He reports on the possible current worth of one share of SpaceX: private firms variously put it at $115, $182, $185, $207, or $209. Which is accurate? As Mr. Z. puts it “who knows?” Equally troubling is what happens if the bubble starts to deflate: “in a market crash, XOVR would have to sell its most liquid holdings, such as Alphabet, Nvidia, Meta Platforms and Oracle, to meet redemptions if investors panicked. That might leave remaining shareholders owning little but SpaceX—which isn’t readily tradable.” The fund advisor fumbled about every query placed to it, leaving The Z to conclude, “If the investment industry wants to sell private assets to the public, it had better do better than this—a lot better.” (You Can Own Elon Musk’s SpaceX. But at What Price? WSJ.com, 1/24/25) Similarly, Morningstar’s Jeff Ptak did what he does best in his analysis of the fund, “How to Manage an ETF … Right Into a Corner” (2/25/25). The short version: Mr. P. analyzes more data, more carefully, and more extensively, than the firm’s own auditors might have. He notes that “Capital Impact Advisors, added private equity to its mandate last year and has heavily promoted it as ‘the first crossover ETF’ to invest in private equity in the months since.” The marketing worked (“Around 80% of the new money that’s flowed into the ETF since November has arrived after Dec. 10, 2024, when Capital Impact Advisors marked the SpaceX position up from $135 to $185 per share. It’s remained at that valuation ever since.”) The problem, he notes, is that this money could head for the exits just as quickly as it rushed in. In hopes of preventing that, the managers might double down on illiquid positions or might face a huge burden in liquidating a partially illiquid portfolio. It’s a good piece of analysis, and quite detailed. Each represents a different position on the liquidity-illiquidity spectrum, with potentially different risk profiles. As Mr. Moriarty modestly observes, “This is a groundbreaking proposal that could open the door for a multitude of copycat vehicles… It’s a wide new ETF world out there.” The core issue isn’t just illiquidity itself but the misalignment between asset liquidity and fund structure. When a fund promises daily redemptions while holding assets that might take weeks, months, or years to sell at reasonable prices, it creates a structural vulnerability. This disconnect is like promising instant sobriety after a night of drinking—it violates fundamental realities. During market stress, this mismatch becomes particularly dangerous as funds may be forced to sell their most liquid holdings first, leaving remaining investors with an increasingly illiquid portfolio. These new ETFs aren’t offering the impossible—they’re offering a trade-off. The appropriate metaphor isn’t “alcohol without hangovers” but rather “alcohol with a hangover cure that might work.” The cure isn’t guaranteed, especially if too many people need it at once. Smart investors understand that innovative financial products don’t eliminate fundamental trade-offs—they merely repackage them in ways that might obscure the underlying risks. The promise of private market returns with public market liquidity should be approached not with excitement but with heightened scrutiny.

Title: The Weakening Economy Needs Rate Relief

ByRobert Barone ByRobert Barone , Contributor. Equity markets were down for the week (again). But it could have been much worse, as the closing results were much improved from Friday’s lows at about 1 p.m. Eastern Time. The S&P 500, for example, finished the day with a +2% gain as markets rallied into the close.[1] As shown in the table, 2025 has been mixed with the S&P 500 and the DJIA positive while the tech heavy Nasdaq and the small-cap Russell 2000 are negative for the year. Equity Market Uncertainty is clearly the order of the day (Trump vs. Zelenskyy, DOGE’s actions to terminate thousands of federal jobs, the imposition of tariffs beginning March 5). It has now appeared to have permeated and soured investor views. The volatility the markets just experienced oftentimes marks a turn in investor attitudes. According to Rosenberg Research, only 29 other times over the last 9000-plus trading sessions have we seen the intraday volatility that occurred on Friday (February 28).[1] The other occasions occurred in 2022, 2020, 2018, 2008, 2002, 2001, 2000, 1999, and 1998. Some of these years were years of Recession. Magnificent 7 Despite showing strong sales and profits (+80%) and guiding higher, Nvidia’s stock still got pummeled, down -7% for the week and about the same year-to-date.[1] It isn’t every day that a tech titan comes in with such good numbers and its share price tanks. A look at the Mag 7 in total shows lower prices across the board for the week and for six out of the seven on a year-to-date basis (Meta being the exception). Could it be that the markets see a slowing economy? Or has the market just run too far? So far in 2025, all the housing data have tanked. Pending Home Sales Most analysts blame these downtrends on high interest rates. But, as shown in the chart below, mortgage rates have been at or near 7% since late 2022; so, something else must be at play. Perhaps the slowdown in the general economy is the culprit. 30 Year Mortgage Rate The weakening economy, high mortgage rates, and the perception by consumers that inflation will continue to be an issue, has taken its toll. The chart shows that consumers still see many hurdles to overcome in the home buying process. Buying Conditions for Houses Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance rose +22,000 in the week ended February 22 to 242,000 from 220,000 the prior week.[1] Continuing Claims, at 2,234,000 are nearly +101,000 higher than a year ago.[2] Due to the DOGE purges in D.C., these numbers will certainly rise sharply over the next few months. Depending on how rapidly the economy slows, we expect the U3 unemployment rate to rise to somewhere between 4.5% and 5.0% over the next six months. Inflation is a process. It isn’t “high prices.” Those “high prices” are the result of inflation. One cause of inflation that economists and the folks who run the Fed worry about is something called the “wage-price” spiral. Simply put, this is where rising wages cause businesses to raise prices which in turn leads to demands for higher wages. Wage Growth & The Quits Rate The chart shows the year/year wage and salary growth rate (blue line) and a smoothed version of the JOLTS “Quits Rate.” Note the strong relationship. When the Quits Rate falls, so does the rate of wage growth. That seems logical. The Quits Rate falls when employers cut back on hiring and jobs become harder to find. The Conference Board’s latest Consumer Confidence Survey complements this chart, showing a rise in the consumer view that jobs are now harder to get than they were just a few months ago. Also in that Survey, the view that there will be fewer jobs over the next six months hit a 12-year high. Generally, we find such views in a slowing economy. Hence, our view that inflation will be at or below the Fed’s target by mid-year. The University of Michigan’s most recent Consumer Sentiment Survey hit its lowest level since November 2023. Inflation expectations over the next 12 months spiked to 3.5% in December.[1] This is the highest level for this indicator since April 1995. No doubt the tariff threats from the Trump administration played a key role. Just for clarity, the tariffs will have an initial impact on inflation, but economists believe that it is a one-time adjustment and doesn’t feed the inflation process. This is a problem the Fed is going to have to deal with and it is likely why markets don’t see any rate decreases for several months. Policy uncertainty has had a large impact on the equity markets. “Tariffs On,” “Tariffs Off.” Which will it be? March 5 appears to be the destiny date. If the tariffs are actually imposed, expect more equity market volatility as that will be another hurdle for the economy. There is no doubt that the U.S. economy is slowing. This appears to be a worldwide phenomenon as the economies of China and those in Europe are slowing, too. In the U.S., we’ve recently seen a decline in Retail Sales, and we know that it isn’t a one-off because Walmart gave very soft guidance. Housing is the poster child for the economic slowdown. The latest housing data screams Recession. And the latest consumer confidence surveys have all turned negative. High interest rates are killing the housing sector. New and Existing Home Sales continue to slow. Because inflation expectations are stuck at levels higher than the Fed’s target rates, the prospect of much needed interest rate relief still appears to be several months away. Our view is that the Fed is already behind the curve, and if they wait until the inflation indexes actually hit their 2% goal before granting rate relief, the economy will already be in Recession. Remember, interest rates impact the economy with long and variable lags. This Fed’s mindset: “No rate relief until the inflation numbers yield.” But if it waits much longer, it will be too late. In fact, it may have already waited too long. (Joshua Barone and Eugene Hoover contributed to this blog.)

Title: 19 Low-Cost Marketing Ideas for Small Retail Businesses

Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:26:26Z

Navigating the realm of marketing on a tight budget can be daunting for small retail businesses. This article demystifies the process, offering proven low-cost strategies and invaluable insights from seasoned industry experts. Discover how to leverage digital tools and innovative techniques to maximize marketing impact with minimal expenditure. Email marketing platforms can cost as little as $10-$50 a month, and they remain one of the best low-cost tools for driving repeat sales. Unlike social media, where reach is unpredictable even with paid ads, email gives businesses a direct, owned channel to engage their current customer base while also reaching new prospects. Brick-and-mortar retailers and ecommerce businesses who collect email addresses at checkout and through their website with strategically placed prompts can segment their users to send targeted promotions, abandoned cart reminders, and loyalty discounts—all of which improve retention and customer lifetime value (CLV). Automated sequences are also a great help for small businesses especially, so they can stay top-of-mind without requiring constant manual effort. Spending under $100 a month on a reliable email platform allows smaller retailers to build customer relationships that drive long-term revenue, rather than relying solely on new customer acquisition. It’s a small cost with major upsides. Teresha Aird, Cofounder & CMO, Offices.net If you’re running a small retail business, optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) profile isn’t optional, it’s a must. When people search for a local store, they’re not scrolling through Instagram ads or watching TikToks. They’re pulling out their phone, typing “best bakery near me,” and clicking on the first few results. If your GMB profile isn’t fully optimized, you’re leaving money on the table and losing potential customers to competitors. Most small businesses set up their profile once and forget about it. That’s like opening a store and never changing the window display. Google prioritizes businesses that stay active, post weekly updates, respond to every review, and upload high-quality photos. Want to take it to the next level? For $100 or less, tools like Whitespark or BrightLocal can help you build local citations to improve your GMB ranking and visibility. The higher you rank, the more foot traffic you’ll get, turning Google into a free customer acquisition machine. Alex Martkovich, Founder, New Digital One low-cost but high-impact marketing expense under $100/month that small retail businesses should absolutely invest in? A geo-fenced Wi-Fi marketing tool like SpotOn WiFi or Zenreach. Most small businesses overlook this, but your store’s Wi-Fi is a goldmine for customer data and repeat visits. Instead of offering free Wi-Fi with no strings attached, use a Wi-Fi marketing tool to capture customer emails and phone numbers automatically when they log in. Once you have that data, you can retarget them with personalized offers, flash sales, and loyalty perks. Here’s a specific way to make this work: One small café I worked with spent $60/month on a Wi-Fi marketing tool and, within 3 months, grew their customer email list by over 2,000 contacts. More importantly, they saw a 14% increase in repeat visits just by sending simple, automated discount offers to Wi-Fi users. For under $100/month, this is a no-brainer for small retail businesses that want to turn one-time visitors into loyal, repeat customers—without spending a dime on ads. Priyanka Prajapati, Digital Marketer, BrainSpate For small retail businesses, I’ve found GoHighlevel’s $97 monthly subscription to be transformative for lead management. After implementing it in my own business, our lead capture effectiveness doubled within the first month. What really surprised me was how quickly we mastered the platform—we started with basic follow-up sequences but soon graduated to sophisticated multi-channel campaigns that previously would have cost thousands through an agency. The game-changer came when we added Yext integration for an additional $30. This simple add-on automatically synchronized our business listings across multiple platforms, creating the consistent online presence that Google algorithms love. Within three months, our local search rankings improved significantly, and we started seeing a steady stream of new customers who found us through various online directories—all maintaining perfectly consistent business information. TJ Rao, Marketing & Sales Consultant, Zevesto Property Group One unconventional yet highly effective marketing spend for a small retail business is advertising on a navigation app like Waze Local. This is a digital, location-based channel that many small businesses overlook, but it can drive real-world traffic to your store for under $100 per month. Waze Local places your business as a pin on the map or a promoted search result for nearby drivers—essentially a digital billboard that reaches customers in your vicinity at the perfect time (when they’re already on the road). You can get started for as little as $2 a day (~$60/month) on Waze Local’s Starter plan. This yields branded pins on the map and search ads in the app without breaking the bank. Even at this modest budget, you’re tapping into Waze’s massive user base of drivers in your area, gaining exposure on a platform with 100+ million users. Waze Local is specifically designed to drive customers into brick-and-mortar stores, not just website clicks. For example, a retail boutique or coffee shop can appear as a branded pin urging nearby drivers to “make a quick stop” at your store. During beta tests, small businesses using Waze Local saw a 20.4% jump in monthly in-store visits on average—a clear, measurable increase in foot traffic attributable to this channel. Marc Lefton, Fractional CMO, Marc Lefton A small business can run effective Google Ads for as little as 3 to 5 dollars a day. That’s about 90 to 150 dollars a month, but if you cap your daily budget and stay laser-focused on local searches, you can keep it under 100. Take a coffee shop for example. You target searches like “coffee near me” within a one-mile radius. If the average cost per click is somewhere between 0.50 and 1 dollar, that gives you 3 to 6 clicks a day. And these aren’t just random clicks. These are people standing on the street, phone in hand, actively looking for coffee. You don’t need fancy campaigns. Just a simple ad with a strong call to action like, “Fresh coffee, one block away,” and a link to directions. Keep it running and you’ll see steady foot traffic without burning through cash. If you want another option under 100, look at boosting local posts on Facebook and Instagram. A well-placed 5-dollar post can hit thousands of people nearby. Or go for an email marketing tool like Mailchimp. For 10 to 20 dollars a month, you stay in your customers’ inboxes and keep them coming back. Nick Spivak, Head of Business Development, IT Monks One marketing expense that costs less than $100 a month but is invaluable for a small retail business is a well-optimized Google Business Profile (GBP) with a local SEO tool like BrightLocal or Whitespark (both under $100/month). Having a free Google Business Profile is essential, but optimizing it properly with consistent updates, customer reviews, and local keywords can significantly improve visibility in search results. A tool like BrightLocal helps track local rankings, manage reviews efficiently, and find citation opportunities—all of which improve local search performance. For under $100, a business can: Local searches often have high intent—when someone searches “best bakery near me,” they’re ready to buy. A well-optimized GBP can drive in-store visits and direct calls without spending a fortune on ads. Investing in local SEO isn’t just about rankings—it’s about making sure potential customers find you at the right moment. Dhiren Mulani, SEO Specialist, Earningify.com Email marketing is like the Swiss Army knife of marketing tools—simple, effective, and versatile. For less than $100 a month, small retail businesses should invest in an email automation platform. We helped a local business boost repeat sales by 18% by setting up automated follow-up emails after purchases. Platforms like Mailchimp or ConvertKit make this easy. Getting the timing and personalization right took a few tweaks. Once we did, the results spoke for themselves. Katja Breitwieser, Digital Marketing Specialist, SocialSellinator A small retail shop seeking a savvy marketing investment of less than $100 per month should definitely invest in a social media scheduling and analytics tool such as Later, Buffer, or Metricool. Social media posting is consistent, but nobody wants to use their whole day trying to remember to press “publish”—particularly when there are a million other things to do. Why it’s a no-brainer: Turns guesswork into strategy—Rather than posting randomly and hoping for the best, businesses gain valuable insight into what’s actually working. For the price of a few fancy lattes a month, small businesses receive an automated system that keeps their brand alive online while they concentrate on managing their store. At a minimum, it eliminates that “Oops, I forgot to post today” panic at closing time. Ben Schreiber, CMO, Latico Leather Google Workspace is hands down the best sub-$100 investment a retail business can make, starting at just $7/month per user. Let me tell you why this isn’t just about email—though that’s a crucial part. Microsoft 365 is also great, but I will stick with Google. First, let’s talk about email credibility. Using a generic @gmail.com, @aol.com, or, worse, an email from your website host is playing business roulette. I’ve seen too many business owners lose important client communications to spam folders or face deliverability issues because they tried to save a few dollars with basic email solutions. A professional email (@yourbusiness.com) through Google Workspace instantly boosts your credibility. But here’s what makes it a no-brainer investment: Think about it: For less than what most businesses spend on coffee each month, you get a professional email system that won’t fail you during crucial business moments, plus a full suite of tools that would cost significantly more if purchased separately. This isn’t just about having a professional email address—it’s about having a reliable, secure, and professional business communication system that grows with your business. Oliver Moreno, CEO / Founder, Bright Click For a small retail business with a $100 monthly marketing budget, I highly recommend investing $5 per day in Meta Ads (Facebook & Instagram) with hyper-local targeting. By focusing on people within your business’s location, you can increase brand awareness and attract nearby customers who are more likely to visit and make a purchase. This strategy has worked exceptionally well for many small businesses I’ve helped, as it ensures consistent visibility without breaking the bank. Even with a small budget, local engagement and foot traffic can significantly improve, making it a cost-effective investment worth trying. Shubham Ahuja, Digital Marketing Manager, DigiLawyer Email marketing-hands down. For less than $100 a month, a small retail business can use platforms like Mailchimp or Klaviyo to stay in front of customers, drive repeat sales, and build real relationships. Here is why I think you should invest in email marketing: You own your audience. Unlike social media, where algorithms decide who sees your content, email goes straight to your customers. It keeps customers coming back. A simple monthly newsletter with new arrivals, special offers, or helpful tips keeps your business top of mind. Automation does the work for you. Set up abandoned cart emails, welcome sequences, and birthday discounts—so you’re making sales while you sleep. I think email marketing hands down is the best way to spend a couple hundred bucks a month. Justin Schulze, Digital Marketing Expert, Schulze Creative Stock photography—or even expertly generated AI graphics—is one of the most valuable marketing investments a small retail business can make for under $100 a month. While AI-generated text can enhance efficiency, compelling visuals are what stop the scroll and grab attention on social media. You have a split second to engage your audience, and high-quality images or graphics make all the difference in whether they pause to read your content or keep scrolling. Investing in a stock photography subscription or an AI-powered design tool ensures that your brand always has professional, eye-catching visuals to support your messaging. Kelly Nuckolls, CMO, Jeskell Systems If you run a small retail shop, one marketing move under $100 that’s absolutely worth it is optimizing your Google My Business (GMB) and running small Facebook/Instagram ads. GMB is free—everyone knows that—but just creating a listing won’t do much. To actually get results, upload fresh photos, collect reviews, and use the right categories so your business ranks higher in local searches. A friend of mine had a small bakery that only locals knew about. After optimizing his GMB and running just $50 in Facebook ads, new customers started finding him through Google. Relying only on word-of-mouth makes growth too slow, but this simple step brought in real business. If you have less than $100 to spend on marketing, this is one of the smartest moves you can make. Anshul Rana, Top Rated Plus Technical SEO Expert, The Digital Geek If you run a small retail business, your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the #1 tool for driving foot traffic, phone calls, and online orders—and it’s free to set up. But to maximize its impact, a small monthly investment in Local SEO tools can be a game-changer. Google Business Profile Management ($0 – $100/month) – If you don’t have time to consistently update your GBP, a local SEO expert or GBP management tool (like BrightLocal or Moz Local) ensures your listings are optimized, accurate, and actively engaging customers. Review & Reputation Management ($50 – $99/month) – Services like GatherUp or Podium help automate 5-star review collection, monitor customer feedback, and improve online trust—critical for converting local shoppers. Google Search Console (FREE) – Your Hidden Keyword Tool – Many small businesses overlook Google Search Console (GSC) as a powerful, free keyword research tool. It shows what real customers are searching for before they land on your website, helping you refine product descriptions, blog content, and marketing strategies to match what people are already looking for. Mitch Cornell, Founder/CEO, Webmasons Marketing If you’re a small retail business and not using CapCut to create content for TikTok and Instagram, you’re missing out big time. Social media isn’t just a marketing channel anymore; it’s how brands are built. People don’t just want products; they want stories, experiences, and personalities. Look at Logan’s Candies, a small-town candy shop that now has lines stretching down the street. Why? Because their TikTok videos showcasing handmade candy-pulling went viral, turning their shop into a destination. That’s the power of social-driven foot traffic. We see this firsthand—we handle the finances for brands that are scaling through TikTok, Instagram, and social-driven sales. The businesses embracing social commerce—showcasing their products, process, and personality online—are the ones thriving. CapCut makes high-quality content ridiculously easy. Auto-captions, trending templates, seamless transitions, it’s a pro-level editing tool without the learning curve. And it’s free (or dirt cheap for premium). Retailers who get this? They’re the ones with lines out the door. The ones who don’t? They’re still waiting for customers to just “walk in.” Sam Hoye, Founder, Social Commerce Accountants One low-cost marketing tactic that proved incredibly effective for small businesses we partner with was utilizing products such as banners, A-stands, and graphics. These high-visibility solutions significantly boosted traffic and sales. They grabbed the attention of potential customers, creating a lasting brand presence in both local and high-traffic areas. The key to this success was the perfect combination of eye-catching designs and strategic placement, allowing businesses to reach a larger audience without a major financial commitment. It is a simple yet powerful way to set any business apart. Michael Cheban, Co-Chief Executive Officer, SignCore When small retail businesses consider their marketing budget, they typically think about social media ads, email campaigns, or local promotions. However, there’s one investment that delivers exceptional ROI while flying under the radar: AI-powered pricing software. For less than $100 a month, this tool can transform your business fundamentals more dramatically than any traditional marketing expense. Think about the core equation of retail: Sales = Quantity x Price. Most small businesses focus exclusively on the quantity side—spending countless hours and dollars trying to attract more customers. Yet they neglect the price component, which can often be optimized with much less effort and investment. A small change in your pricing strategy can immediately impact your bottom line across every single transaction, making it arguably the most leveraged marketing investment available. Nabeel Siddiqi, CEO, Moksha AI LLC Showing yourself on Instagram and LinkedIn costs your time, which can be very valuable indeed. However, the integration costs nothing, so take the time to be consistent, let potential clients see you and how you work. If people hire who they know/like/trust, then take the first step and let them know you!

Title: Meta Quest 3 vs Pico 4 Ultra: Which VR headset should you buy?

Time Published: 2025-03-03T16:30:00Z
Full Content:
Two of the biggest standalone VR headsets are about to do battle When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. We're living in the age of standalone, mixed reality headsets, and with lots of brands getting in on the fun it's getting more and more important to be armed with the knowledge of which one is right for you. Unless you have thousands to splash out on one, there are two rivals duking it out for the top spot, the Pico 4 Ultra, and the Meta Quest 3. Squaring off for this Saturday night blockbuster fight are two headsets that can offer a lot of versatility. Whether you just want one of the best VR headsets for immersive gaming, you want spatial computing power, or you want a fun new way to enjoy some you-time without distractions, the Pico 4 Ultra and Meta Quest 3 are great products for you to consider. Although the Meta Quest 3 is much more commonly known, you shouldn't count the underdog out early. The Pico 4 isn't available in US markets, so that does take it out of contention for a lot of readers. Still, if you're anywhere else in the world, the Pico 4 Ultra is an extremely formidable opponent for Meta's Quest 3, and may even top it in certain aspects. There's a multi-round battle ahead of us, so grab your popcorn and get ready for a classic. Zuck's Meta Quest 3 is off to a raring start, as we all suspected. The Pico 4 Ultra just hasn't turned up in this opening round. Since the Quest 3 is available at so many retailers in the US and UK, it's the clear winner here. The Pico 4 Ultra is available in the UK though, and although I've seen it dip out of stock just once since its release, I'd say it's probably the harder of the two headsets to come across. As it continues to age, the Quest 3 is likely to get more discounts, bundles, and deals too. Let's not forget that the Meta Quest 3 comes in a few different variations too. The Pico 4 Ultra has one 256GB SKU, whereas the Quest 3 has its 512GB model, the 3S 128GB model, and the 3S 256GB model as well. The Quest 3 did have a more affordable 128GB version, but that's since been discontinued now that the 3S headsets are here. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Winner: Meta Quest 3 This is the round where things get interesting. After a near knockout in that first round, Pico 4 Ultra seems to have woken up, and we've got a real fight on our hands. On paper, the Quest 3 and Pico 4 Ultra have very similar specs. They both share the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which in fighting terms is equivalent to having the same coach. In short, you're going to get very similar experiences with both of these devices, and there isn't much that separates them. Pico 4 Ultra Meta Quest 3 Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen2 Resolution 2160 x 2160 per eye 2064 x 2208 per eye Refresh rate 90Hz Variable - 72Hz, 90Hz, 120Hz Field of View 105 degrees 110 degrees Sensors iTOF Depth sensor, Two MR cameras RGB cameras, 4 IR cameras Lenses Pancake Pancake Display 2 x LCD 2 x LCD Storage 256GB 512GB Cameras 2 x 32MB cameras 2x RGB 18PPD cameras Audio Integrated speakers Integrated 3D spatial audio speakers RAM 12GB LPDDR5 8GB Weight 580g 515g Eye Tracking None None Battery 5700mAh (2-4 hours depending on use) Up to 2.2 hours average Connectivity Wi-Fi 7, USB-C WiFi 6E, USB-C As you can see, it's a very close match-up to call between these two headsets. The tale of the tape has a lot of back and forth and a lot of things that are virtually the same, or cancel one another out. The Pico 4 Ultra has strengths in its Wi-Fi 7 support which means it'll be faster to install games and content. It also has 12GB of RAM up from 8GB in the Quest 3, which arguably futureproofs it more for more demanding VR games that have larger levels. RAM is really important in terms of VR computing power, so that's a huge win to have. The Pico 4 also does a great job of its crystal clear cameras and room tracking thanks to a depth sensor the Quest 3 doesn't have. The Quest 3 has more versatility when it comes to refresh rate, since depending on the application and what feels right for you, you can vary the frame rate of the headset from 72Hz to 90Hz, or even 120Hz. 110 degrees of horizontal field of view feels like a cheap win over the Pico 4 Ultra's 105, but it is a slight disparity. Storage also sits in the Quest 3's corner, although I'd argue this is less of a win in VR, since applications and games take up such a small amount of space compared to flat-screen games. Whatever Meta's been doing with audio has paid off though, and a big win for the Quest 3 comes in its quality of sound. While weight technically goes in Meta's favor too, I'd argue it's one of the specs that's virtually identical, for reasons I'll come onto. This is a tough round to call, but I think the wins that Pico 4 Ultra has in terms of its spec sheet are more significant strikes than the ones the Quest 3 can land. It's more about futureproofing in this arena, and the 12GB of RAM and increased Wi-Fi speed do make a big difference. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra (but not by much) If there's one disparity on the spec table that makes no sense, it's that the Meta Quest 3 weighs less than the Pico 4 Ultra. That's because the Pico 4 Ultra is designed to sit so comfortably on your face, and the way it distributes its weight across your head deserves a lot of credit. Longer sessions fly by while wearing this device, and that's down to some excellent design. A lot of that comes down to the fact that Pico's headstrap is much more substantial than Meta's. It reminds me of the one used for the Meta Quest Pro, and it feels like better value for money than the very simple material strap you get with the Quest 3. On the other hand, the best Meta Quest accessories do allow you to personalize your device to suit the comfort and weight distribution you'd like, so it's not a total walkover in this round. I'd argue this is a nice parry, but not an ideal counter since accessories demand more money on top of the headset. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra This one is another complicated round, and it's a bit of a shame, really. The Meta Quest 3 launched in October of 2023 and its 512GB SKU landed a lofty price tag of $649 / £619. The Pico 4 Ultra then launched just under a year later, and with a 256GB storage capacity that fit between the Quest 3's two models in price while touting some beefier specs. It launched to the tune of £529 in the UK, coming in comfortably under the Quest 3's larger 512 variant and making an excellent name for itself in the process. As an underdog, it really felt as though this was going to be a necessary move to win favor among VR shoppers who knew Meta's Quest brand well. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before things turned sour for Pico. The Quest 3S devices launched at $299 / £299 for 128GB, and $349 / £349 for 256GB. The Quest 3 128GB model was discontinued, and the 512GB Quest 3 received a price drop down to $499 / £469. It feels like a low blow has been struck to the underdog Pico 4 Ultra while the referee wasn't looking, and the Quest 3 has a smug look on its face as it walks back to the corner. Winner: Meta Quest 3 One of the biggest slights I hear against the Pico headsets is that they don't have access to the number of games that the Quest 3 has, and while that is true, it really isn't as bad as you think. A lot of the VR heavy hitters are still available on both headsets and if this is really a concern for you, maybe check to see if your favorite games are exclusive to one or the other before purchasing. You may find like I did, that the list the Pico 4 Ultra misses out on isn't actually that long. Both have access to Steam Link and can be hooked up to a gaming PC, so if you plan to tether to a beefier machine that can access SteamVR's library of games, both will do you just fine. Meta's Horizon OS does tend to be the first one to be thought of, however, so who knows what the future may hold as it likely continues to become the larger platform. Winner: Meta Quest 3 This one is slightly subjective, but from testing both headsets extensively and going through the process of reviewing them, I'd argue the Pico 4 Ultra is the better gaming device. It's a comfier headset that again, thanks to that weight distribution, extra RAM, and better depth sensing, makes immersive gaming experiences so much richer. There are fewer technical stutters that remind you you're running a standalone device through its paces, controllers track a bit more consistently, and in all honesty, I noticed more visual detail in Pico 4 Ultra games. At the same time, the visual fidelity on both headsets is virtually identical since their lenses, resolutions, displays, and FOVs are so close to one another. Meta Quest 3 has better passthrough quality since, for some reason, you can clearly read content on other screens better, but either will give you great passthrough quality. I'd say one of the big difference makers in this department is the controllers, which on the Pico 4 Ultra, are just that little bit better. They're marginally longer than the Quest 3 and have a few extra buttons, and it's amazing the difference this makes in games like Blade and Sorcery. Then again, the Quest 3 has some really polished hand-tracking features these days, if that's your thing. I think the motion trackers that come with Pico's device do add a lot more potential for immersive gaming experiences though. Winner: Pico 4 Ultra It's been an exhausting fight for the ages. Both combatants have come away bloody, beaten up, and bruised, and while neither has scored a decisive victory, there can only be one champion. I think the Pico 4 Ultra is, in a lot of ways, a better headset than the Quest 3. It feels a lot more tilted toward power users and those who want a futureproofed device that'll be able to run demanding VR games without compromise for years to come. It feels designed to counter some of the worst parts of the Quest 3. It's comfortable without the need for extra accessories, and its controllers aren't so small they lose tracking capability. Its software offering isn't as limited as some make it seem, and there's a lot of potential to use it in versatile ways, like any mixed-reality device today. It is hugely limited by its reluctance to enter the US market, however, and it's a shame we probably won't see a direct fight on the shelves between such close rivals. The Quest 3, thanks to its accessibly priced Quest 3S models, does a lot to bring VR technology into the mainstream limelight. In this day and age, it's the affordable, versatile, and genuinely capable VR device to own. In other words, the Quest 3 wins, but only because it had a home advantage.

Title: AI Briefing: Ad verification’s duarchy touts AI to Wall Street amid expansion plans

Time Published: 2025-03-03T05:01:00Z

Join us at the Digiday Publishing Summit from March 24-26 in Vail DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science have spent years as rivals focused on brand safety and verification, tasked with protecting the world’s biggest brands from showing up in problematic places. However, as recent reports show, things can slip through the cracks. Now, they’re moving beyond the open web, using AI offerings — some built internally and some acquired — to compete for new types of advertisers in new ad arenas. Both companies, which reported earnings late last week, showed off their road map for winning over mid-market advertisers across new channels like social media, CTV, and retail media. They’re also moving beyond the thorny issue of brand safety to try and prove themselves in yet another tricky area: performance and measurement. On a call with analysts, DoubleVerify CEO Mark Zagorski described 2025 as a “transition year” following what he acknowledged was a disappointing quarter. He said DoubleVerify is still in the investment phase of building out new tools across social, sell-side tools, outcomes and attribution. One part of the plan is the newly announced $85 million deal to buy Rockerbox to help build out new capabilities around performance attribution and optimization. Rockerbox, which DoubleVerify estimates will contribute around $8 million in revenue this year, will also help unlock a new segment of mid-market, direct-response advertisers to widen its addressable market. Zagorski emphasized the deal fits into DoubleVerify’s broader strategy of transforming its business from a static verification exercise into something more holistic. “You have to innovate, or you will die,” Zagorski said. “So we think there’s an opportunity for us to continue to invest in growth.” Some ad tech experts say buying Rockerbox makes strategic sense and will help compete in curated media buying and measurement. Others wonder if it might compromise the third-party verifier’s neutrality but say it might also give DoubleVerify more incentive to improve media quality. The acquisition could help with DoubleVerify’s push to attract small-to-medium businesses (SMBs) and expand beyond brand safety into performance validation. Karsten Weide, an analyst at W Media Research, said it could also give DoubleVerify a performance edge against competitors like IAS and Human — and against Adjust and AppsFlyer, which don’t have media quality expertise. “The opportunities this acquisition presents are substantial,” Weide wrote in a post about the deal. “First, it broadens DV’s [sic] total addressable market by targeting small to mid-sized performance companies, a segment historically underserved by its enterprise-focused offerings.” Industry analysts are split on the deal’s financial logic. Weide said the $85 million price tag is steep, especially if Rockerbox is only expected to generate only $8 million in revenue this year. However, Gartner analyst Andrew Frank said $85 million is a “pretty small deal in the overall scheme of things.” He’s interested in Rockerbox’s use of synthetic data — a growing trend in AI adoption — to model missing exposures and infer ads that may have contributed to a sale. “It’s going to plug more and more holes in the targeting and measurement foundation, which has been a growing problem for a lot of advertisers as well as the publishers who are trying to convince them that the ads are worth it,” Frank said. On Integral Ad Science’s earnings call with analysts, CEO Lisa Utzschneider said there’s a lot of room to go after mid-market advertisers. She defined the category as companies that generate between $200,000 and $1 million in revenue for IAS. “We are investing both in the front end in investing in more sellers, more support, more technical support,” Utzschneider said. “And on the back end, performance really matters to the mid-market advertisers. So pouring fuel on our performance products, investing in automation and self-serve.” DoubleVerify and IAS have expanded efforts across social media offering more measurement and activation within walled gardens like Meta and TikTok. Last month, both announced new content-level avoidance integrations for Facebook and Instagram Feeds and Reels. Like its rival, IAS is working to bring its AI offerings into walled gardens. Last month, it announced content blocklist optimization tools across Meta’s platforms. Earlier this year, IAS debuted a new deal with Reddit to let advertisers integrate AI tools from IAS to measure brand safety and suitability campaigns. So far, DoubleVerify only measures 5% of all U.S. social impressions, but it’s already become a $110 million business, Zagorski said. DoubleVerify also sees both Rockerbox and Scibids playing roles in social media by combining Rockerbox’s performance data and Scibids’ AI optimization. DoubleVerify plans to use its Universal Content Intelligence AI platform to help advertisers avoid unsuitable content and optimize performance. It has also expanded its brand safety tools across TikTok and YouTube. One analyst asked if Meta’s plans to pull back from fact-checking might give IAS an inroad. Utzschneider said it’s too soon to tell but also noted the topic came up a lot during CES in meetings with advertisers. “I will say our role in the digital ecosystem, our role in providing a best-in-class multimedia classification in all of the major live feeds of social platforms, is a tailwind for our business,” she said. “The brands were very clear during CES….They’re leaning into us to help navigate with them the environment that we’re operating in right now, and that’s a big reason why we continue to invest deeply in our tech.” DoubleVerify and IAS have both been under increased pressure to improve their brand safety efforts following the recent Adalytics report and subsequent letters from Congress expressing concerns about everything from URL reporting to more transparency into how its AI systems operate. Adalytics wasn’t mentioned on either earnings call, but some of the questions analysts asked seemed to have it in mind. One analyst asked about DV’s plans to expand URL-level reporting. Zagorski noted it’s more about making features more broadly available than offering anything new and added that it’s “more of a transparency initiative than an actual revenue or growth driver.” “It kind of shows our commitment to driving greater transparency in the ecosystem to giving our advertisers comfort and confidence in where and how they’re buying,” Zagorski said. “…We look at it as part of our responsibility in driving trust in the ecosystem.” Whether advertisers will continue to trust DoubleVerify and IAS with their spend is something Wall Street will have to wait until next quarter to find out. The ad tech giant’s path back into shareholders’ favor could put pressure on its ties with media agencies. The Parisian holding company has invested more than $1.5 billion in acquisitions over the past six months. ‘Joint Business Plans’ are a less spoken of but vitally important means of growth for the online ad industry’s middlemen as Darwinism takes hold.

Title: The top wealth-creating stocks have put $21 trillion back into shareholders' pockets — and 3 are still cheap to buy
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/stock-picks-biggest-wealth-creators-decade-cheap-morningstar-2025-3

Past performance does not guarantee future success; it's a line frequently used for investing advice. That's because stocks are a moving target amid shifting fundamentals, business cycles, interest rates, and inflation. But that doesn't mean their historical strength can't be considered. If a company's stock has continued to rise, especially for over a decade, that sustained performance suggests it's doing something right. And it could be a good starting point to filter for good long-term investments or see if any common characteristics helped them succeed. Amy Arnott, a portfolio strategist at Morningstar, recently did just that by pulling a list of the top stocks that have created the most value for investors over the past decade. One common denominator among the vast majority of them is that they have wide economic moats, which means they are less likely to face competition in the next 20 years. This is especially important for companies spending mega dollars — like AI players — in hopes of reaping long-term benefits and wider market share. And to do that, they need a long runway with little competion to reap the returns of their capital expenditure for many years. She also found that stocks able to create a lot of value over long periods of time tend to continue performing well for many years, which reinforces the approach of Warren Buffett, who once quipped that the ideal holding period is forever. In this instance, Arnott measured value creation by looking at the biggest increases in market cap from 2015 through 2024, plus the value of dividends each company paid. The list she pulled includes 15 sector-neutral names. Unsurprisingly, Big Tech, and more specifically Nvidia, tops the list as the stock that has returned the most value to shareholders, with more than $3 trillion in value created. It is followed by Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Tesla, and Broadcom, all of which created more than $1 trillion in shareholder value. However, even if these names are well recognized, it doesn't mean it's a good time to buy shares. While there's a mixed bag of reasons a stock can fall out of favor, one of the central ones is simply that the share price already reflects the strength of the company. Nonetheless, three names stand out for being rated four stars out of five, which means Morningstar considers them moderately undervalued or trading at slight discounts to their analysts' fair-value estimates. Microsoft is one of the Big Tech players being pulled forward by its AI innovation, particularly its cloud computing platform Azure. While revenue growth is expected to slow for the giant, going from 15.7% in 2024 to 13.2% by 2026, the company's operating margin is expanding, from 44.6% in 2024 to 45.1% by 2026; it's a sign of continued profitability and efficient capital expenditure, a key gauge of successful expansion amid steep AI spending. Its fair value estimate, according to Morningstar, is $490 a share. As of Friday, it was trading near $391 a share, meaning it's still at a discount. Morningstar's senior analyst Dan Romanoff's conviction on the price target rides on expectations of growing profitability from its cloud computing platform Azure, its next-level offerings in Office 365 E5, and its Power Platform, which allows companies to develop websites and apps simply. Alphabet is another major player in the cloud computing space that's also spending big bucks on AI development. One hiccup the giant tech firm faces is capacity limits on its cloud platform, which has slowed revenue growth. However, Malik Ahmed Khan, an equity analyst at Morningstar, expects capacity to widen which will pick growth back up. Meanwhile, he points to other areas of Google's strength, including revenue growth from its AI-driven search engine and its YouTube business. Even as the search engine giant's revenue is expected to slow, its operating margin is expected to expand slightly from 32.1% in 2024 to 32.3% by 2025. The analyst increased the stock's fair value estimate from $220 to $237 after it beat fourth-quarter earnings expectations. UnitedHealth Group has had a bad few months. First, the shooting of its former CEO, Brian Thompson, in Midtown Manhattan sparked widespread backlash over the company's approach to insurance coverage. Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported the company was under investigation for potential Medicare billing fraud. Its stock price has been volatile as investors try to gauge what to make of all the news. Still, Morningstar's senior analyst Julie Utterback believes the stock is undervalued at a fair value of $590 a share. On Friday, it was trading near $467. Utterback's note highlights that in 2024, the firm made 47% of its operating profits from medical insurance, but only 15% came from Medicare. Therefore, the probe over Medicare shouldn't be cause for a steep sell off, suggesting investors are overreacting. Additionally, the investigation could have a wide range of outcomes. However, investors who decide to take on exposure in healthcare stocks should be prepared for volatility and keep their ears at the door as Republicans release changes to healthcare coverage. Still, Utterback writes that the stock's price is discounted enough to buffer policy uncertainty. Jump to
