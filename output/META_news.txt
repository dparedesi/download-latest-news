Canaccord Genuity has lifted its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price target to $404 from $298, maintaining a Buy rating despite weaker-than-expected deliveries in the fourth quarter. The move comes as the financial services firm remains confident about the carmaker’s long-term growth potential and the upcoming product launches. According to Canaccord’s Thursday note, the new target price is based on 40x Canaccord’s 2027E non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $10.11, compared to a previous multiple of ~34x on 2026E EPS. “We feel this multiple is justified based on the multiples and growth rates of Tesla’s comp set — which we deem to be a group of megacap tech stocks, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),” analyst George Gianarikas said in the note. “This set of companies trades at a median of ~23x 2027E EPS but has a combined revenue growth rate ~half of Tesla’s from 2025-2027,” he added. Tesla’s latest delivery results were below expectations. The company reported 4Q24 deliveries of around 495,600, representing 7.1% sequential growth but falling short of Canaccord’s estimate of ~533,000 and the consensus estimate of ~498,000. Tesla’s production in the same quarter declined by 2.2% sequentially to ~459,500 units. Canaccord’s decision to maintain its bullish stance centers on new product introductions slated for 2025. Tesla has guided for new vehicles and anticipates 20-30% year-over-year unit volume growth. “Tesla tends to deliver excitement when it refreshes its portfolio,” the note stated. This growth potential, combined with signs of bottoming auto gross margins, supports Canaccord’s positive outlook. Tesla reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100 in 3Q24, the lowest in the company’s history. “We’ll see how new products impact the mix — but we do forecast improving margins in 2025,” Gianarikas said. Canaccord also highlighted advances in Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. While the firm remains cautious about timelines for robotaxi deployments, recent updates to FSD have been described as “unbelievable, incredible” by users, signaling potential for higher adoption rates. “An increase in FSD adoption could positively impact Tesla's profit margins and bolster confidence in the company's ability to monetize its substantial investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure,” the analyst continued. Moreover, Tesla’s energy storage segment remains a bright spot. Deployments surged to about 11.0 GWh in 4Q24, up 59.4% sequentially and 243.5% year-over-year. The construction of Tesla’s Shanghai Megafactory was completed in late 2024, and production is expected to ramp up in 1Q25. Lastly, Canaccord points to the potential in the robotics sector for Tesla, emphasizing it sees 2025 “as the year of the robot.” “We see increasing support for Tesla’s earnings multiple based on its leadership in this burgeoning sector.”

Our goal is to improve Project Management (PM) profitability and reduce discrepancies in information among stakeholders, which can result in conflicts. This will be accomplished by incorporating Earned Value Management (EVM) with the Income Statement and incorporating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with the work breakdown structure (WBS). These incorporations will streamline information sharing between PM, other management professionals, and the stakeholders, ultimately fostering the application of PM within broader business and management contexts. We drew on theories from Project, Operations, Financial Management, Agency Theory, and the Theory of Performance Frontiers. We conducted multiple case studies in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. Our analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative methods, ensuring the accuracy and practicality of our hypotheses and instilling confidence in our research findings. This integration addresses the information gap on profitability for non-project management professionals, empowering stakeholders to enhance project performance. This integration benefits the company by allowing the project manager and stakeholders to gain real-time insights into the project’s profitability, which enables continuous optimization of daily EBITDA by improving efficiency and productivity to achieve the project’s profitability target. This study and its innovative findings originate from the author’s unique approach, which is a significant contribution to the field of Project Management. This research focused on project management using EVM in for-profit organizations. Integrating EVM in the income statement also facilitates PM application in other management systems.

Project management is a well-established field that deals with complex tasks within tight constraints [1, 2]. It is integral to modern management with strong theoretical foundations and scientific rigor [3–5]. Despite its importance, project management research receives little attention in leading business and management journals. The project management manifesto encourages collaboration between social scientists and urges business and management experts to make project research more relevant to society [3]. The use of EVM in project management has grown but is not widely accepted in business due to its limitations in addressing quality, uncertainty, and profitability [2, 3]. Current EVM indicators are limited and need enhancement. Profitability measurements are missing, creating a lack of real-time awareness among project managers and potential conflicts with stakeholders [4]. Upon analysis, it’s clear that EVM lacks profitability indicators. This hampers managers’ real-time understanding of project profitability, leading to reliance on financial reports later. This knowledge gap among managers can create conflicts. Our research suggests integrating EBITDA into EVM to maximize daily EBITDA in all processes, WBS, and work packages for improved performance and profitability. Our study utilized multiple embedded case studies within complex defense industries in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. We collected and analyzed qualitative data through NVivo interviews and quantitative data through SPSS surveys. Data collection took place over a longitudinal time horizon. We aim to improve EVM by integrating it into the income statement and linking EBITDA to WBS and work packages to provide timely profitability information, enhance daily performance, and broaden the practical application of project management. This research has implications for real-world implementation in business and management. This study focuses on both profit-driven and not-for-profit organizations, as both need to secure operational earnings for sustainable success. However, the study does not delve into the measurement of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in project management, nor does it explore the role of project management in valuations such as mergers and acquisitions. The novelty of this research lies in integrating EVM into the income statement and EBITDA into the WBS, enhancing project management profitability and applying EVM–PM in other business and management fields, which is the author’s innovation. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1, Introduction, and Section 2. Literature Review and Section 3 Research Methods. Then we will have Section 4, Result and Discussion, and finally, Section 5 is the conclusion. The upcoming section will provide a comprehensive review of how to enhance Project Management (PM) profitability and elevate PM applications in other business and management fields. Firstly, we will explore project-based firms (PBF), projects, and Earned Value Management (EVM), including components such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Packages. We will also delve into Agency Theory, which covers the roles of principals (Project Owners) and agents (Contractors) and how information gaps about profitability can lead to conflicts among stakeholders. Additionally, we will discuss the disparity between PM language and financial literacy, such as Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) among stakeholders, and its impact on information asymmetry using the theory of Productivity Frontiers. To address Research Question 1, we need to answer research questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to understand the practical application of EVM in business management. Therefore, we will delve into topics such as Project Based Firm (PBF), Agency Theory, and Information Asymmetry in Section 2.1. Fig 1 visually presents the five steps to incorporate Project Management EVM with the Income Statement. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g001 In section 2.2, our focus is on the integration of EVM into the Income Statement, a crucial step to improve Project Management profitability. In Section 2.3, we will explore the appropriateness of EBITDA as the Primary Profitability indicator of PM. Section 2.4 will discuss how to integrate EVM–Income Statement and EBITDA to enhance profitability, and Section 2.5 will delve into how to maximize PM daily EBITDA. Furthermore, section 2.6 will discuss the benefit of using EBITDA in the EVM-PM. Section 2.7 will discuss enhancing EVM-Income Statement—EBITDA in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to support PM. Additionally, we will organize the literature from section 2.1 until section 2.5 and define the boundary of the study that focuses on PM from the agents (contractors’) perspectives and exclude the discussion of project owner benefits that may result from the project usage after PM completion. We also exclude discussing managing interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization for corporation valuations. Finally, in section 2.8, we will summarize how to elevate PM applications by integrating EVM with income statements and WBS—EBITDA into other business and management fields and summarize the hypothesis we built during the literature review. Project management is a complex field that aims to deliver cost-effective, high-quality, timely, and safe products [4, 6–10]. Frontier analysis identifies best-in-class companies and areas for improvement, driving continuous improvement and providing a competitive advantage [11]. We will explore how to enhance the use of EVM beyond project management and traditional methods [4], to prioritize project management efficiency, productivity, and profitability from the outset. Project management is crucial for project-based firms (PBFs) to enhance employee performance and execute projects effectively [2]. It extends to encompass internal and external stakeholders with diverse expectations [3]. Agency theory provides insights into inter-organizational relationships, highlighting the importance of aligning the principal’s and agent’s value propositions to achieve optimal project management outcomes [12]. Prioritizing diverse stakeholders and promoting transparent communication are essential. Information asymmetry arises when one party possesses information they do not openly share. However, such information asymmetry can give rise to opportunistic behavior [13, 14], typically exhibited by the agent [15] and sometimes by the principal [16]. RQ1. How can a company integrate EVM into Income Statement to improve Project Management Profitability and elevate application in the Business and Management? To answer Research Question 1 (RQ1), we split it into three RQ as follows: Further we will study the literature to answer RQ1. 1 by studying seven layers of Income Statements (I/S) framework. The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, is a vital financial reporting tool for businesses and management, providing crucial insights into costs, benefits, and operational profitability [17–21]. The seven-step income statement structure, depicted in Fig 1, serves as a valuable framework. The process starts with revenue, direct operating costs, and gross profit, a key measure of operational profitability. However, it is important to note that gross profit does not account for indirect operating costs [22], and should not be the sole measure of operating profitability. On the other hand, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) includes all operating costs, including depreciation and amortization. Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs, they are not directly controlled by project managers but rather by the board of directors (BOD) [23, 24]. Thus, we do not recommend using EBIT as a profitability objective for daily project management activities, as daily depreciation and amortization are fixed costs not within the control of project managers. EBITDA includes direct and indirect operating costs but excludes interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Company EBITDA is solely under company operational control, and PM EBITDA is under project managers’ control. EBITDA can be used to measure operational efficiency, productivity, and profitability [24, 25], making it a valuable key performance indicator (KPI) for project management. Our next step will be to delve into its suitability as a KPI in PM and investigate how to integrate EVM with the income statement framework. It is essential to recognize the significance of PM profitability for its success, growth, and continual operation [26]. Thus, it is crucial to grasp the terminology of profitability measures in Earned Value Management (EVM) and align them with the profit and loss framework, as depicted in Fig 2. EVM is a comprehensive system that compares actual and budgeted work values, time, and costs. Through the integration of time and cost perspectives, EVM assesses schedule and cost performance, calculates variances, and forecasts total cost and duration [2, 7, 27–33]. (Author’s property). (Author’s property). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g002 Fig 2 illustrates several EVM indicators, including Planned Value (PV) as the "budgeted cost of work scheduled" (BCWS), Earned Value (EV) as the "budgeted cost of work performed" (BCWP), and Actual Costs (AC) as the "actual costs of work performed" (ACWP) [27, 29–32, 34, 35]. The Earned Value Management (EVM) method lacks profitability indicators, leading to information imbalances among stakeholders. Integrating profitability indicators into EVM will enhance transparency and support from stakeholders [18]. Additionally, the EVM method does not consider revenue, using the term "budget" instead, necessitating the inclusion of a baseline for production and profitability [26]. The interpretation of Planned Value (PV) varies based on perspective. For effective management of profit-driven organizations, it is crucial for a contractor’s planned cost to differ from the planned revenue received from the owner. Setting a zero-profitability target may not motivate project managers to prioritize profit, and an unclear buffer between revenue and cost may lead to cost overruns. Project managers (PMs) can utilize EBITDA as a buffer between revenues and costs to address this issue. This buffer can be represented by the equation: Planned cost = planned revenue minus planned EBITDA. By integrating the EBITDA target as a profitability goal, the project manager can effectively manage profitability and intervene early if necessary [33, 36]. Moreover, incorporating buffer into the EVM system can positively impact profitability [37]. In Fig 2, we illustrate the integration of EVM into the Income Statement and the incorporation of EBITDA into the framework. Incorporating EBITDA into EVM can streamline accounting processes and enable direct project performance management. However, it’s important to evaluate the relevance of using EBITDA as a KPI in project management before implementation [38, 39]. Within this framework, our objective was to verify the suitability of EBITDA as a KPI in PM. In addressing the second research question, we explore the significance of profitability for project management activities and introduce some terminology related to operational profitability. Fig 3 vividly illustrates the seven crucial steps of an Income Statement. It begins with sales activity, effectively generating revenue. The next step involves the Company’s core operations, which consume direct operational costs, encompassing both variable and fixed costs, culminating in the creation of gross profit. The third step involves the Company Supporting Units engaging in Indirect Operations activities, such as General Administration, and consuming Indirect Operating Costs resulting in EBITDA (Earnings Before interest, depreciation, and amortization). Finally, the decision to expense Depreciation and Amortization by the Board of Directors leads to EBIT (Earnings Before Interests and Tax), also called Operating Profit [25, 40]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g003 Noticeably, the Company’s operations management authority is confined to specific operational expenses, as control over Depreciation and Amortization expenses rests with the Board of Directors. The decision to account for Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax falls within the Board of Directors’ purview, limiting the Operations Management’s jurisdiction to EBITDA. Consequently, operations management has no complete control over operating profit expenses because it excludes depreciation from its jurisdiction. The ultimate earnings that operations management can deliver is EBITDA [25, 40]. The frontier approach assesses performance using managerial benchmarks and theoretical perspectives. The production frontier represents the highest level of performance achievable by an operational unit based on its operational decisions (Vastag, 2000). EBITDA can be a critical operational management performance indicator (KPI), representing the profitability frontier under their direct control. In addition, Fig 3 illustrates the correlations between earnings metrics, such as Earning Before Tax (EBT), Earnings After Tax (EAT) or Net Profit, and Retained Earnings, and management authority and control. This illustration highlights the essential role of operational management in achieving profitability and control [25, 40]. Critics of EBITDA as a company indicator argue that it is an inadequate measure for evaluating investment activities since it requires consideration of other indicators and is not a reliable proxy for net cash flow [41]. Additionally, some argue that EBITDA is insufficient for guiding financial strategies and valuation decisions such as bankruptcy, mergers, and acquisitions [42–45]. On the other hand, advocates of EBITDA as an indicator maintain that it is a suitable measure of a company’s operations and project management profitability, reflecting the ultimate profitability that only operations management and project management can achieve [41, 46–50]. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a crucial metric used to gauge the achievement of critical objectives and is essential for understanding and enhancing performance [51]. EBITDA is a performance metric that assesses a company’s profitability by excluding factors such as taxes, interest, and debt costs [23, 52]. It is a reliable indicator of operational effectiveness and is well-suited as a profitability metric for evaluating operational management [53]. It’s important to align performance dimensions with company practices such as knowledge management, openness, and sustainability [54]. Performance measurement involves assessing effectiveness and efficiency using specific measures [55]. EBITDA is crucial for operational management and integrating it into earned value management (EVM) can help project managers plan and control financial targets. An effective performance management system should incorporate a limited number of KPIs to provide a comprehensive view of company performance and prevent information overload [55]. Integrating EBITDA into EVM allows project managers to plan and control financial targets effectively. Based on this review, we establish the following hypotheses: In this section, we will delve into integrating EBITDA into EVM for project management, which addresses the third research question. Our focus will be on exploring the incorporation of EBITDA measures to maximize daily EBITDA within EVM, and we will pose two important questions: 1. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS enable active profitability management? 2. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS streamline operations and project management while increasing profitability? To address these inquiries, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of various EVM performance indicators and devised a strategy for integrating EBITDA into the current system. EBITDA is crucial as a performance metric not only to gauge performance but also to facilitate the formulation of improvement initiatives [54]. Performance indicators play a vital role in enabling companies to evaluate their systems’ adherence to standards and progress toward specific objectives [56]. Using key performance indicators such as EBITDA empowers managers to adeptly guide the company towards enhancement, make well-informed decisions, and incentivize and reward employees. With technological advancements, it is now feasible to collect data and analyze the most pertinent variables in real time to assess key performance indicators [51]. Fig 4 depicts the S-Curve EVM project management from the project owner’s viewpoint, wherein PV represents the Planned Value equivalent to the Planned Costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g004 The Budget Actual Costs (BAC) represent the accumulated planned expenses for a project. The Earned Value (EV) is subtracted from the Actual Costs (AC) to calculate the cost variance. Meanwhile, the Schedule Variance (SV) compares the Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV) against the project baseline and work schedule. It’s worth noting that EVM relies on monetary values instead of schedule indicators, which some professionals may find unreliable [32, 57]. This study focuses on examining the financial metrics utilized to manage project management profitability. However, the current version of the Earned Value Management (EVM) framework lacks complete oversight over production and revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an additional baseline to ensure better control over these aspects [26]. EBITDA and EVM can be integrated into project management for a positive outcome. The project manager can use EBITDA as a buffer to manage actual costs effectively. Based on Fig 5, the EBITDA figure is positive, which suggests that the revenue surpasses the costs incurred (EV-AC). In project management, cost variance is the difference between planned and actual costs, denoted as CV (PM) = planned costs—AC. Moreover, schedule variance (SV) is the difference between the work performed and the scheduled planned value (SV = EV—PV). We must integrate these metrics into each WBS and work package to include EBITDA and EBITDA Margin in the EVM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g005 Numerous companies encounter difficulties when implementing budgets [58]. The literature emphasizes that performance measurement is essential for effectively managing production systems [56]. Inaccurate data can hinder companies in assessing profitability and recognizing areas for improvement [54]. Financial indicators like EBITDA are important for demonstrating the process’s financial performance to management. Developing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as EBITDA would enable stakeholders to have visibility into the process’s real-time performance [59]. Monitoring real-time product costs is crucial for promptly identifying any unexpected increases that could erode the EBITDA margin [51]. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a framework for outlining the project budget [30, 60, 61]. EBITDA can be assigned to each WBS and Work Package using a top-down approach, establishing target EBITDA and refining these allocations based on bottom-up input. By combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, governance challenges can be addressed effectively, and learning within the project management process can be promoted. The allocation of EBITDA to every WBS provides a profitability indicator for each business process. Companies can apply Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to reduce activity costs by analyzing and redesigning WBS workflows and processes [62]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into the WBS facilitates the implementation of BPR in project management, ultimately strengthening profitability. In addition to the result of the study in section 2.4 we will further study to addresses the third research question RQ3. How can a company use integrated EVM-I/S to increase PM profitability and maximize PM daily EBITDA? To maximize daily EBITDA, project managers need to focus on improving cost efficiency, productivity, quality, delivery, and safety [13, 63, 64]. The first step is to provide structured indicators to assess whether a production system efficiently uses its resources [56]. Maximizing daily EBITDA involves conducting daily simulations [65], setting high expectations, utilizing objective data, and providing timely feedback on performance [66]. Strategies like Business Process (BP) methods [11], and the Project Value Risk Opportunity (PVRO) framework can help achieve high-performance positions and optimize decision-making [4, 67, 68]. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint through lean methods in business process management, which involves identifying customer value and addressing wastage to resolve bottlenecks. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint by increasing their capacity with extra resources [69]. Addressing wastage can resolve bottlenecks in the process, leading to improvements [59]. The superficial differences in Business Processes improvement may significantly impact project success [62]. In summary, we define the following hypotheses: This section answers the fourth research question: What benefits does using EBITDA to measure PM profitability offer? Through a literature review, we identified the limitations of EVM implementation [6], and how integrating EBITDA can mitigate these issues: It is crucial to integrate EBITDA into each Work Breakdown Structure as it enables a company to establish an internal control system for guiding resource allocation decisions based on WBS EBITDA or EBITDA Margin. These internal control systems are essential for managing companies with multi-operation production systems, particularly in the context of organizations overseeing multiple manufacturing facilities. The introduction of divisional and departmental budgets plays a key role in overseeing daily operations and comparing production and costs across different divisions and departments [65]. Integrating EBITDA into WBS, the company can differentiate the critical and non-critical activities in Project management. Project managers are required to work closely with other departments to effectively manage EBITDA and meet EBITDA targets. Coordination involves integrating a series of interdependent tasks that are essential for organizational productivity and efficiency [70–72]. Cooperation is vital for the successful implementation of complex strategies, relying on coordinated efforts and information sharing [71, 73]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into EVM will allow for better visualization of the interdependency among activities. Achieving target EBITDA requires improved cooperation, coordination, and interdependency among activities. Maximizing daily EBITDA hinges on improving behavior and engagement. Engagement refers to involvement, commitment, and the willingness to overcome obstacles or constraints in strategy execution, ultimately challenging these constraints and delivering better performance [70, 74–76]. Therefore, integration of EBITDA into WBS will simplify manager to manage profitability. Ensuring maximum daily EBITDA across all work breakdown structures and work packages requires effective communication. Precise and efficient communication is vital for sharing strategic information and facilitating successful implementation [72, 75, 77]. Thus, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will provide project managers with the necessary information. Therefore, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will enable the project manager’s ability to get the information needed. The above findings reveal that integrating EBITDA as a business process target and WBS enables project managers to improve daily profitability. The integration simplifies the project managers’ ability to demonstrate daily profitability (to avoid information asymmetry). In addition, the integration enables support project manager in achieving successful strategy and PM Target. Based on our findings, we formulated the following hypothesis: Building on the previous findings, we are now addressing research question 5: How can a company optimize its support for strategic PM decisions using EBITDA? Evaluating project success is challenging, as different stakeholders have varying definitions of success. To address this, it’s important to consider the perspectives of the owner, contractor, end user, and the public. While measuring management performance is crucial, financial results often lag behind decision-making, posing challenges for taking timely action [55]. To prevent delays in accessing profitability information, it is recommended to monitor daily EBITDA. By sharing profitability information and displaying planned and actual daily EBITDA, the company can promote transparency and enhance its capabilities in this area. This approach fosters effective communication, supports knowledge management, and reinforces the significance of project management [17, 20, 78]. The equitable distribution of information has a positive impact on both individual and organizational performance. Effective communication by project managers significantly enhances the performance of project teams, as managers dedicate considerable time to communicating with team members and key stakeholders [79]. Sharing information can facilitate manufacturing decisions while visualizing and communicating efficiency and productivity can assist in setting goals and driving performance improvement [80]. The use of EBITDA indicator in every WBS enables PM to indicate deviations and streamline our business processes. This method helps us visualize and evaluate capacity across all processes, synchronize operational capacity, and identify bottlenecks [81, 82]. It is essential to communicate clearly and effectively when sharing information about EBITDA results, including the target, strategy, and implementation. This clear communication is crucial for ensuring that everyone understands the information and can successfully execute the strategy [70, 72, 77]. By summarizing this discussion and those in the previous subsections, we developed the following hypotheses: comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. From the above study, we can summarize that integrating EVM—Income Statements -WBS—EBITDA can broaden the application of EVM in management and business fields. Further, we will provide a summary table to ease the test of the hypotheses in the next Section. To answer RQ1, we summarize the finding from previous study and hypothesis in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t001 Table 1 provides an overview of the research questions, corresponding hypotheses, planned data collection, and analysis for Batch #1 and #2. The second round of data collection and analysis will be carried out to assess the comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. In reference to the study discussed in Section 2, it was concluded that incorporating earned value management (EVM) into income statements has the potential to improve project management profitability and increase its significance in the business and management fields. This research is a step towards wider acceptance of EVM in these domains. Furthermore, we will delve into the hypotheses in the upcoming section. The authors have confirmed that this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (ethics committee) of the Bandung Institute of Technology prior to commencement. The original approval document was obtained from our academic institution’s ethics committee. The author and the author’s institution have obtained permission from the companies to conduct research for academic purposes and have been authorized to produce academic literature. The ethics statement document includes the written permit (approval) for research within the companies. The researcher/interviewer conducted the study without any prior relationship with the participants. Regarding participant consent, the author and the companies informed the participants that the study was purely for academic purposes. The research participants are company officials and management; no minors were included. The authors commenced research in Shipbuilding on May 15, 2023, and concluded it on July 12, 2024. Additionally, they initiated research in Aircraft Manufacturing on May 22, 2023, and completed it on July 19, 2024. To explore the connection between EVM and profitability, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Publish or Perish with the keyword "Earned Value Management." Initially, our search resulted in over 1000 articles. We then refined our search by adding the keyword "profit" and setting the publication date from 2014 onwards, which narrowed the relevant articles to 108. Using NVivo, we meticulously analyzed these articles to identify word frequencies. Our analysis revealed that "project = 15.754," "earned = 3.226," "EVM = 3.390," and "costs = 1.068" were frequently mentioned, while "revenue = 66," "profit = 300," and "profitability = 53" appeared less often. Overlooking these critical aspects could lead to information imbalances and conflicts among stakeholders, underscoring the necessity of integrating profitability into EVM for effective project management [78]. The table of this findings is available in S1 Appendix. Later in this chapter, our research indicates that EBITDA is the optimal profitability frontier for project management [67] and can serve as a suitable indicator for PM. By integrating EBITDA into EVM methodology, we can maximize daily EBITDA in every business process, WBS, and work package to enhance PM performance and profitability. Our research aims to create practical solutions through a pragmatic philosophy. Our methodology combined deduction and induction, and we developed a protocol to guide our research process [83]. We collected qualitative data through interviews and observation, while quantitative data was collected through online surveys. We employed a Multiple Embedded Case Study design. The selection was imperative to examine project complexity factors from an unbiased and comprehensive perspective [84]. Our analysis involved using SPSS for statistical analysis and NVivo for qualitative analysis. The Case Study Protocol and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Checklist are available in S2 and S3 Appendices [83, 85]. The corresponding author conducted the interview or focus group. The author has 25 years of experience as a management consultant and is considered an expert in turnaround strategies. The participants know the interviewer as the company’s Turnaround Expert. The interviewers’ genuine interest in the research topic and enthusiasm about conducting a case study that combines long-term practical experience with theory is evident. The study focused on understanding profitability information asymmetry in Project Management using EVM systems. They are eager to share knowledge with academic and practical communities. The authors of this study delved into relevant theories and conducted surveys to comprehensively explore the effects of information asymmetry on profitability in Project Management, specifically through the use of EVM systems. They found that this information imbalance could potentially lead to conflicts between management and stakeholders. To gain a deeper understanding, the study employed both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, utilizing multiple embedded case studies and surveys. The research focused on Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to improve Project Management Performance and Profitability. Specifically, the study included two project-based organizations in the defense industry. The authors conducted detailed case studies on two companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their WBS. The first company, a prominent shipbuilding company, managed 25 projects, including warships and submarines, while the second company, an aircraft manufacturing company, oversaw 20 projects, including helicopters and rockets. The study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews and purposive sampling, were utilized. Invitations were extended to 30 individuals from Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies, and 20 participants from various levels within the organizations were selected to take part. Regrettably, ten individuals were unable to participate due to time and scheduling constraints. Additional qualitative data was gathered through observations at aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies, as well as through meeting minutes from the corporate office. The research purpose was to communicate to the interviewees through various means, including face-to-face interviews, emails, WhatsApp messages, and phone calls. The company’s Board of Directors and employees were involved in the survey and interviews. The researcher obtained qualitative data from the corporate office through observations, interviews, and meeting minutes. During the interviews, only the interviewer and the interviewees were present. However, during observations and group discussions, non-participants who were company employees not assigned to the project were in the room. The researchers provided a question guide and survey questionnaires for the structured interviews. For the unstructured interviews, the interviewees freely expressed their opinions about the program. Repeat interviews with the same person were not conducted. Structured interviews involved asking the same standardized questions to different interviewees. Before recording, the author informed the interviewees that the interview would be recorded and obtained their consent. During the interviews, the author used audio-visual recording via Zoom to gather data, enabling the taking of meeting minutes during the session. Interviews and discussions typically lasted 30–60 minutes, and participants received transcripts for review. For Interviews, we sent thirty invitations to two companies, ten people unable to participate due to time and schedule constraints. As shown in Table 2, the author held two sessions of interviews with 20 volunteers representing various positions, including board members, senior executives, managers, project managers, and professionals from the PM team. The interview participants are as follows: one COO (Male, master’s degree); one CFO (Male, master’s degree); one EVP (Male, a master’s degree); nine V.P. (1 Male with a Doctorate, 1 Female with a master’s degree, 4 Males with a master’s degree, 3 Males with a bachelor’s degree); and eight Managers (1 Male with a master’s degree, 3 Females with bachelor’s degrees, 4 Males with bachelor’s degrees). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t002 The first session consisted of structured interviews with predetermined questions. We distributed research protocols before the questionnaires to ensure the validity and reliability of our study [83, 84]. In the second session, we conducted unstructured interviews to delve deeper into participants’ understanding of integrating EBITDA with EVM and its usefulness in project management for their company. We specifically focused on the benefits of measuring PM EBITDA for project managers and stakeholders [78]. We used a longitudinal time horizon to understand the development of business processes and cultural improvement over time, which is valuable for researchers and project managers [2]. The researcher identified the themes in advance, but the author did not discuss data saturation in this qualitative research. The author used NVivo software to analyze the qualitative data from the interviews. During the project/program briefing, the participants were provided feedback on the findings. In addition, we combined the case study with the survey method to create a comprehensive mixed-methods research design [83]. The author collected data from two separate participant batches from shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing companies for quantitative data. We conducted our survey in two batches, with 220 volunteer participants (104 Shipbuilding participants, and 116 Aircraft Manufacturing Participants) surveyed over six months to test Hypotheses. As shown in Table 3, during the second batch, we involved 125 volunteer participants (from both companies) over 11 months to test hypotheses A, B, C, and D. Our empirical data was collected using questionnaires scored on 7-point Likert scales and was quantitatively analyzed using SPSS. The researcher used the participants’ quotations to explain the findings from the interview results. The participants conveyed their perspectives using standard daily language, adding depth and authenticity to the research. This use of daily language made the findings more transparent and more relatable by showcasing how they were grounded in the participants’ actual words. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t003 Referring to section 2.1.3, Fig 2 shows the integration of the income statement’s structure, EVM, and its relationship with management control. Our research findings from section 2 indicate that companies can integrate EVM into overall business management by aligning it with income statement metrics. We propose expanding the use of EVM beyond project management. Project managers can incorporate EBITDA into every WBS to facilitate the direct translation of EVM indicators into financial reporting language and establish a relevant profitability metric for project management. To validate these conclusions, we comprehensively analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to address all remaining research questions. In our initial data collection, we analyzed 220 questionnaires using IBM-SPSS to examine the use of EBITDA in project management profitability. We also investigated how a company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system and the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability. This analysis used the following abbreviations: AMC means aircraft manufacturing corporation and SBC means shipbuilding corporation. Supporting Information for the First Batch of data analysis is available in S4 Appendix. Proportion Testing Hypothesis Research Question 2: Is EBITDA the proper measure for project management profitability? Hypothesis 1.A: EBITDA is the proper measure of Project Management Profitability because it excludes Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization, which do not vary due to Project Management efficiency and productivity variation. Hypothesis 1. B: EBITDA is the proper measure of project management profitability because it is entirely under the control of the project manager and team. Research Question 3: How can a company maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system? The Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA with EVM and applying target EBITDA margins in every work breakdown structure and work package. Hypothesis 2.A: The Company can maximize EBITDA with EVM in Project Management by integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying target EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. Research Question 4: What are the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability? Hypotheses 3.A: Using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows Project Managers and Teams to manage and maximize Project Management Profitability actively. Hypothesis 3.B Applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily Research Question 5 How can a company improve its ability to support and make strategic decisions for Project Management using EBITDA? Hypotheses 4.A: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA result with its supporting Units. Hypothesis 4.B: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA with the Board of Directors to provide timely strategic decisions to Project management Chi square Testing This analysis technique belongs to non-parametric statistics, which is a branch of statistics that does not rely on the assumption of a particular distribution of the data. It is often used when the data does not meet the assumption of normality or when the sample size is small. This method is more flexible and can be applied to ordinal data or data that is not measured at intervals. Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in the population proportion test Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 Table 4 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t004 The First Batch Hypothesis testing results are shown in Table 4. 1. While testing hypothesis 1.A, both AMC and SBC agree that EBITDA is a suitable measure of Project Management Profitability. 2. In evaluating hypothesis 1.B, there is a divergence of opinions between AMC and SBC regarding the control of EBITDA Project Management, with SBC disagreeing with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value>0.05). 3. When testing hypothesis 2.A, there are differing opinions on whether integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying the target EBITDA Margin in WBS and Work Package can maximize EBITDA in EVM. Less than 70% of SBC respondents disagreed with the statement (χ2- value < 3.481 and p value> 0.05). 4. Hypothesis 3.A. testing indicates that using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows for active management and maximization of profitability, with approval from most AMC and SBC respondents (more than 70%, with χ2- value > 3.481 and -value < 0.05). 5. Hypothesis 3.B testing reveals a key insight: applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS empowers companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily. While SBC respondents may have disagreed (χ2- value < 3.481 and p-value >0.05), the practical implications of this finding are significant, providing a clear path to enhanced profitability management. 6. In testing hypotheses 4.A and 4.B, a unanimous approval was received from all AMC and SBC respondents. This finding underscores the Company’s potential to enhance its ability to support Project management by sharing daily Targets and Actual EBITDA results with the Company’s supporting Units and the Board of Directors, instilling confidence in the proposed strategies. After implementing Maximizing Daily EBITDA in Aircraft Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Companies for eleven months, we conducted the second round of data collection. We gathered responses from 125 questionnaires without differentiating between aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies. We tested several EBITDA and operational profitability hypotheses using a test statistic, χ2. The results of the testing are summarized below. Supporting Information for the Second Batch of data analysis is available in S5 Appendix. Our commitment to a comprehensive analysis led us to conduct proportion testing on the data, testing a multitude of hypotheses. This rigorous process is a testament to our dedication to providing the most accurate and insightful findings. H01) π ≤ 0.70 and Ha1) π > 0.70. The test statistic used is Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if χ2>χ2 table with α = 0.05 The results are summarized in Table 5 below. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t005 Proportion Testing Hypothesis H01: π ≤ 0.70 Ha1: π > 0.70 The test statistics used in Chi square test are , x is people who answered 6 or 7 on the question E = n.po and po = 0.70 decision making: Reject Ho if p-value < α (= 0.05) Sumary sub section 4.1.2: Table 6 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t006 All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were greater than 0.70 (70%) with a small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompasses both structured and unstructured interviews. After completing a comprehensive qualitative data analysis, it has become evident that EBITDA is the most suitable operating profit indicator for the EVM system in Project Management. Integrating EBITDA into EVM involves establishing the budget’s EBITDA value to determine plan costs and applying the EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. By using EBITDA to evaluate project management profitability, the company can empower the project manager and team to understand the target EBITDA and maximize profitability. Sharing EBITDA can also enhance support and facilitate timely strategic decisions for Project Management. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo, as depicted in Table 4, showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompass both structured and unstructured interviews. Discussion of qualitative analysis with NVivo Table 7 and Fig A-3 until A-6 in S1 Appendix display the results of the qualitative analysis using structured interviews by NVivo. Supporting Information of the interview is available in S6 Appendix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t007 Referring to the Quantitative and Qualitative data results, we found that some employees needed to be aware of the importance of EBITDA for Project Management during the early assessment. Regarding H2, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that EBITDA project management is entirely under the control of the project manager and the team. This response is because some operational and project management personnel remained unaware of the EBITDA concept. Many of them were not concerned with controlling EBITDA. The Interview with the chief financial and human capital officer (Interviewee O) confirmed this result. Regarding H3, less than 70% of SBC respondents agreed that a company can maximize EBITDA in EVM by integrating EBITDA into WBS and applying the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package. This response is because some people in the SBC did not have experience implementing the EBITDA–EVM integration. The SBC was in the early stage of implementing EBITDA–EVM integration using its information technology system, the ITS. The senior vice president of corporate transformation (Interviewee D) confirmed this explanation in the Interview. Regarding H5, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control project management profitability daily. This response is because some SBC employees need experience managing daily Profitability. However, the management expected the situation to change because the Company has begun implementing daily control and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system, supported by their information system, ITS. The vice president of human capital (Interviewee M) confirmed this explanation and explained the Company’s policy to control employees’ daily activities using handphone devices provided by the Company. After eleven months of maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management, we found significant improvement in understanding the concept from the survey of both companies. Regarding the first research question, we found that the respondents agree that EBITDA is appropriate for project management profitability. Fig 2 displays the integration of EVM into the Income Statement using seven earnings steps. Fig 3 shows EBITDA under the control of Operation Management and Project Management. On the other hand, Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax are not under the control of Operation Management but of the Board of Directors. Regarding the second research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Regarding the third Research Question, we found that the respondents agree that the Company can get the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability from Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that will ease Operational Management and Project Management to display their Profitability every day. Regarding the fourth research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company improved its ability to support and make strategic decisions for project management using EBITDA from the availability of daily EBITDA information for divisions and company operational units, as well as project management to provide support for achieving successful strategy and project management. All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were more significant than 0.70 (70%) with a relatively small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values ​​calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. Based on our assessment, some employees need to understand the significance of EBITDA for project management. Less than 70% of the SBC respondents initially agreed to incorporate EBITDA into WBS and apply the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package to optimize EVM. The SBC is still in the early stages of integrating EBITDA and EVM using its information technology system, the ITS. Significant improvements were observed after nearly a year of focusing on integrating EVM into income statements and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management. The respondents concur that EBITDA is the appropriate measure for project management profitability. The consensus among respondents was that the company could enhance daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures (WBS). Concerning management practices, when proposing a program like integrating EVM into an income statement in project management, managers consider the expected costs of adoption against the expected benefits. The new system’s speed and ease of adoption will depend on corporate and national cultures [86]. It is strategically advantageous to incorporate EBITDA into every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Package. This integration allows the management team to effectively oversee job assignments. When combined with Earned Value Management (EVM), this approach can significantly enhance profitability by improving efficiency and productivity. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS aligns project management and financial systems. This common language enables leaders to cultivate a robust corporate culture, enhance efficiency, and improve productivity for superior performance and profitability. By comparing EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends before and during project management execution, organizations can make informed decisions about resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio. Despite the importance and widespread nature of projects, there is currently little space devoted to project management research in leading business and management journals. We need more research for systemic approaches to projects, situating them in broader organizational landscapes. Addressing grand challenges involves changing project management practices to create and distribute value among diverse stakeholders [3]. The principles of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are accessible to all project management professionals and can be applied across various business and management domains. It is hoped that professionals in fields other than project management will adopt these concepts. This study demonstrates that incorporating EVM into income statements can enhance project management profitability, reduce information asymmetry, and garner support from stakeholders for making strategic decisions to ensure project management success. Specifically, this integration allows project managers to optimize Daily EBITDA within each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and achieve improved performance and profitability. Integrating EVM into the income statement was challenging and required a shift in organizational culture. However, after eleven months of focusing on maximizing daily EBITDA within the EVM system, there was a notable improvement in understanding the concept based on the survey responses from participating companies. The study also highlights that EBITDA is a suitable metric for assessing project management profitability, as it is within the control of Operations Management and Project Management. Conversely, factors such as depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes fall under the purview of the board of directors rather than operations management. Furthermore, by incorporating EBITDA as a target within each WBS, companies can effectively maximize daily EBITDA in project management within the EVM system, providing a clear view of profitability daily. This integration will facilitate communication between project management professionals and business management and foster greater acceptance of project management concepts within the business and management fields. Hopefully, this will also encourage dialogue between project management scholars and those in related disciplines, particularly business and management. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The Organization can improve its decision-making regarding resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio by conducting a thorough comparison of EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends both before and during project management execution. This study provides valuable insights and evidence-based ideas about project management and can potentially enhance its use in the business and management sectors. The author’s unique contribution lies in integrating EVM into the income statement with EBITDA into WBS. This research ensures we can apply the theoretical concepts effectively in practical settings with broader implications. The implications of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are understandable to any project management professional and can be applied across various business and management sectors. It is hoped that professionals in fields beyond project management will embrace these concepts. These topics warrant further in-depth exploration in future research. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s005 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s006 (DOCX)

Title: Is AI A Boom, Bubble, Or Con? Here’s What The Evidence Suggests

Robot and young woman face to face. Everyone knows that the stock market’s super-run in recent years has revolved around seven core stocks: The “Magnificent Seven” of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (in alphabetical order). Most of the seven, if not all, are assumed to be the beneficiaries of the stupendous growth of artificial intelligence. The “Magnificent Seven” have a combined market value of more than $17 trillion, and accounted for over half of the S&P 500’s total return in 2024. Over the last five years, all seven have seen annualized appreciation rates of 20 percent or more, with Tesla hitting 73 percent and Nvidia exceeding 90 percent. Is this sustainable? How does it all end? And what does it say about the AI boom that plays a pivotal role in the seven’s success? Two years ago, I published a Forbes column about Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and the bitcoin mania. Back then, the price of a single bitcoin hovered around $20,000, while it hovers around $100,000 today. Then, like now, a key question was being asked: Is bitcoin a boom, a bubble, or a “con”? The Wall Street Journal’s Vicky Ge Huang recently compiled the warnings that some of the world’s great investors gave the public about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and yet the $100,000 valuation suggests we’re not listening. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a useless “pet rock,” while Citadel CEO Ken Griffin wonders aloud, “What problem does it solve for our economy?” But what about AI? Is artificial intelligence something that the truly sophisticated suspect to be another bubble, and we’re ignoring that risk? Or is AI an actual boom, and the question is how and when the “landing” comes? My conclusion is the latter. AI is a real investment in something that even less experienced investors can understand where big-league returns may arise. From medical applications to breakthroughs in content creation or computer science, AI is already revolutionizing the world of work, and there’s no reason for the innovation to stop now. And yet, will the returns be big enough or likely enough to warrant the kind of investment it now takes to “get in the game”? That’s where I get more skeptical. There is a long list of things that have to go right for the value creation of the magnitude assumed by today’s AI pricings to materialize: One thing is clear: AI is a very real and transformative technology, but scale will be integral to addressing such problems. The market will only want—and can only afford—four or five surviving players. As product competition leads to commoditization, competitive pricing and the ability to “stay current” will be the keys to survival. As always, a select few investors will make enormous sums of money either by riding the wave and getting out of the water in time, or picking one of the ultimate survivors and hanging on for the ride. Countless start-ups and venture capital firms will see 100 percent losses as they stall out on scale or fall outside the cone of competitive capability. However, all of the evidence suggests AI is neither a bubble nor a con; it is a boom with lasting potential. While there is plenty of irrational exuberance related to AI, that is the free market’s way of experimenting and learning, which have always given the U.S. economy its edge. AI’s biggest winners will have solutions that address real problems and create new forms of competitive advantage, and we should be ready for those benefits to materialize in the coming years. On the other hand, hindsight will become 20-20 for the losers who assumed it was a “sure thing.” When only a few numbers will come up winners, I don’t see anyone winning by placing bets across the board. AI will be a long-term winner for a select—and potentially magnificent—few who successfully sell their wares with scale to customers who happily pay for the cost and productivity gains they will create.

Title: The Morning After: FCC’s attempt to restore net neutrality didn't work

The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the FCC does not have the "statutory authority" to implement net neutrality rules. Since the rules were established in 2015, the FCC argued that classifying ISPs as "telecommunication services" gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as "information services" during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017. The current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year. The difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court's recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. The Chevron doctrine said that if Congress doesn't weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, interpretation falls to the individual judge, and the Sixth Court doesn't agree with the FCC. This is the end of the road for the FCC’s attempts to wrench a little bit of the power from internet providers and carriers and level speeds and access regardless of service. Net neutrality rules will remain in California and other states, but anything at the federal level will require either an act of Congress or, for this case, be appealed to (and succeed in front of) the Supreme Court. – Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox.

Reuters reports that the company agreed to pay $95 million to class members, estimated to be tens of millions of Siri-enabled device owners. The lawsuit stemmed from a 2019 report that Apple quality control contractors could regularly hear sensitive info accidentally recorded by the voice assistant’s “Hey Siri” feature. The clips were said to include medical information, criminal activities and even “sexual encounters.” Reuters notes that $95 million in cash amounts to about nine hours of profit for the company. If you owned a Siri-enabled mobile product during that period (and Judge White approves the settlement), you might get a heady $20 per device.

The shake-up comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and it's the latest sign of how tech companies are positioning themselves for a new administration in Washington. Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, said he is stepping down, citing the new year as the right time to move on. He'll be replaced by Kaplan, who will take on the title of chief global affairs officer. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush, and he appeared at the New York Stock Exchange with Vice President-elect JD Vance and Trump in December. He also attended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in 2018 as a personal friend, causing a controversy for the social media company. "I will look forward to spending a few months handing over the reins — and to representing the company at a number of international gatherings in Q1 of this year," Clegg wrote in a memo to his staff that he shared on Facebook on Thursday. Clegg joined the company in 2018 after a career in British politics with the Liberal Democrats party, and he helped Meta navigate incredible scrutiny, especially over the company's influence on elections and its efforts to control harmful content. Clegg also helped steer the company through the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook shared user data with third-party political consultants. He also represented the company in Washington and London, frequently at panels for artificial intelligence and at congressional hearings. "My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector," Clegg wrote. In his note, Clegg said Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, would replace Kaplan as Meta's vice president of global policy. He mentioned that Kaplan would work closely with David Ginsburg, the company's vice president of global communications and public affairs. "Nick: I'm grateful for everything you've done for Meta and the world these past seven years," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. "You've ... built a strong team to carry this work forward. I'm excited for Joel to step into this role next given his deep experience and insight leading our policy work for many years."

Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production. This is all based on a report from October 2024 on The Information (a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release. The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either. Back in October, The Information said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech. If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As MacRumors points out, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely. Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame. We’ve contacted Apple for a comment. .

The 24 forecasts we made in 2024, revisited. by Bryan Walsh, Dylan Matthews, Marina Bolotnikova, Sigal Samuel, Kenny Torrella, and Izzie Ramirez Making predictions is a tricky business, and here at Future Perfect, we don’t pretend to have a crystal ball. But we do think there’s real epistemic value in putting our forecasts out there and — just as importantly — owning up to how they turned out. (Something that happens too rarely in the media, as we learned after November’s election.) Looking back at our predictions for 2024, we had a wild ride trying to anticipate a year that threw more than a few curveballs our way. For 2024, we made 24 predictions in total, covering everything from who would win the White House to whether Elon Musk could actually get those Cybertrucks on the road. When the dust settled, we got 14 right and 10 wrong — batting .583. That’s Shohei Ohtani on a hot streak, though down somewhat from our 2023 results. But I did say it was a topsy-turvy year. Some calls were right on the money, though. We correctly saw Trump’s comeback and the GOP taking back the Senate. We nailed it when we said Oppenheimer would grab Best Picture (I mean, who didn’t love watching Cillian Murphy brood for three hours?). And we were spot-on about some big international news, like Claudia Sheinbaum making history as Mexico’s first woman president and Modi keeping his grip on power in India. But hey, nobody’s perfect. We thought the FDA would greenlight MDMA therapy for PTSD — that was a swing and a miss. We seriously underestimated how many Cybertrucks Tesla would crank out. And while we got some tech predictions right (looking at you, Waymo and SpaceX), we whiffed on predicting OpenAI’s moves. The whole point isn’t just to keep score — it’s about getting better at this prediction thing through practice and learning from our mistakes. And in a world that seems to get more unpredictable by the day, we think that’s a pretty useful skill to develop. —Bryan Walsh I like to imagine that at least one incredibly sheltered person is learning this fact from this article: Donald Trump was elected to a second nonconsecutive term as president. There wasn’t much courage or confidence in this prediction, which I put at only 55 percent odds. My basic approach was to try to use a political science model incorporating national polling, and I came up with a prediction of a narrow Trump victory. President Joe Biden was fairly unpopular, and Trump was narrowly leading him in polling. I wasn’t confident that advantage would persist — but it did. I will say that if I had updated my prediction throughout the year, it would have changed a lot. I remember in June, before the disastrous Biden-Trump debate, telling friends I gave Trump a 75 percent chance to win; after the debate, I bumped it up to around 90 percent. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden and surged in polling compared to her predecessor, I reverted to something like 50-50 odds. The actual race and its contours were changing dramatically, and my sense of the race changed dramatically too. Almost by coincidence, the ultimate election wound up being the narrow contest that polling would’ve predicted at the end of 2023. —Dylan Matthews I think my past self explained the reasoning here well: “There are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it.” Everything did not go right simultaneously for Democrats this election. They had already lost a seat forever when Joe Manchin decided to retire in West Virginia, a place where no other Democrat-caucusing candidate could ever win, which left them with a 50-seat maximum in 2024. Then they lost Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana, red states that were going to be tough for Democrats to hang on to in a presidential election year. Then, in something of a shock, Pennsylvania’s Bob Casey was defeated by a private equity multimillionaire who doesn’t really live in the state and can’t tell the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers apart. When that guy wins, you know Democrats are having a bad year. On the plus side, it could’ve been much, much worse for Democrats. Despite Harris losing Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won the Senate race there narrowly. Tammy Baldwin barely hung on in Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin won an open seat in Michigan by 0.3 percentage points, even as those two states went for Trump. If the Senate results had followed the presidential map, Republicans would have a 56-seat majority and no trouble confirming anyone Trump wants in his Cabinet. Instead, they ended up with 53 seats, which might be just small enough to cause Trump actual trouble. —DM My reasoning here was that Republicans held a very small majority in the House going into the election, and Democrats seemed likely to pick up a number of seats in New York in particular due to redistricting. Sure enough, the party picked up three seats in New York, but lost others to pick up only one seat on net — not enough to flip the chamber. In my defense, I was clear this might happen, writing, “There’s still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time.” As it happens, that is the world we live in. But with 220 Republicans in the House and 218 needed to pass anything, there might not be much that Trump can do with this majority. —DM I have not always had the best track record when it comes to inflation predictions, but this one worked out. It was clear in 2023 that inflation had started to decline rapidly in the wake of the Fed’s interest rate hikes, and that decline continued through 2024, enough so that the Fed was able to start cutting again. By the Fed’s preferred measure — the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy — prices grew by 2.8 percent from October 2023 through October 2024. That’s an annual rate below 3 points, though not by a whole lot. The Fed’s goal is to get the number down to 2 percent. I find it hard to see prices stabilizing that much, especially if tariffs from the Trump administration cause consumer prices to spike in a one-off event. But we’re clearly doing better than a few years ago. —DM I like to make this prediction mainly to draw our readers’ attention to the scandalous number of Americans killed by our transportation system. In 2023, according to statistics released this year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that number dropped by about 3.6 percent from 2022, to a still-abysmal 40,990, a figure that remains significantly elevated after a Covid-era spike erased more than a decade of progress in reducing car crash deaths. How many is that, exactly? It’s about as many Americans as are killed by guns and more than double the number killed in homicides overall, though it’s far fewer than the numbers of Americans who die from diseases like heart disease and cancer. It’s twice the number of people killed by cars in the European Union, even though the EU has 100 million more people. And the federal car fatality statistics are actually around 10 percent lower than the true number of Americans killed by cars because they exclude some cases, including crashes on private roads and parking lots. If today’s rates remained steady, a rough estimate would suggest that about 1 percent of all Americans would be killed by cars — a stunningly high cost of admission into our car-dependent society. —Marina Bolotnikova I almost always predict that Netanyahu will stay in power, but I made an exception when writing last year’s predictions because the Israeli public was so incredibly furious at him after Hamas’s October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Polls were showing that voters wanted him out — by a wide margin. I figured if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, this was it. But even this wasn’t enough. Israel has a parliamentary system, where governments typically form on the basis of coalitions. Netanyahu is really, really good at pacifying his allies in the governing coalition — and they have kept him in power. —Sigal Samuel Climate change is very obviously making its effects felt. This summer was the hottest on record globally. By November, scientists said this year is “virtually certain” to break 2023’s record. They also noted that 2024 marks the first year that Earth is more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than in the pre-industrial period. Sadly, this prediction was a pretty solid bet: You can make it every year and you’ll get it right about 80 percent of the time. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, “This is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.” —SS Modi secured a third straight term as India’s prime minister after this spring’s massive elections, which saw over 640 million voters turn out. It’s an achievement equaled only by India’s founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and one that was about as easy to predict as any outcome in this record-breaking year of global elections. Modi rolled into the elections with an approval rating in the mid-70s, or roughly twice as high as Biden’s popularity around the same time. In a year when incumbent leaders around the world fell in election after election, Modi and his BJP party were a sure thing — so much so that my only regret was not choosing a probability of 99 percent. Even so, this election did not turn out the way many prognosticators expected, myself included. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured a majority in Parliament with 293 seats, but that was well short of the 400 seats the alliance was shooting for. And the BJP itself only won 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it had won in the previous election. As a result, the party lost its solo majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 10 years. As my colleague Josh Keating wrote, the results were bad for Modi but good for India as a whole, showing that the world’s biggest democracy remains a democracy. An overwhelming victory would have fed into Modi’s growing authoritarian inclinations, which were on display this year as the Indian government attacked critics at home and abroad — including in the US. India was a rare example in 2024 of the people successfully pushing back against a would-be autocrat. —BW There was no courage in the prediction that the massively popular, but term-limited, left-wing President Andrés Manuel Lopéz Obrador (AMLO) would be succeeded by his protégée, Claudia Sheinbaum, a past mayor of Mexico City and climate scientist. The polling, even that early on, showed Sheinbaum with a massive lead over challenger Xóchitl Gálvez, an indication of both Sheinbaum’s talent and the popularity of AMLO and his Morena party. Sheinbaum’s election was historic: She is not only the first woman elected president of Mexico, but the first Jewish person and (to the best of my knowledge) the first scientist. Climate advocates shouldn’t be too sanguine, though. Despite her professional background, Sheinbaum has no interest in shrinking the popular state-owned petroleum sector. —DM After the chaos of 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and 2023, when Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group of mercenaries mutinied and nearly took Moscow, 2024 was a less momentous year in the war. There were major shifts, to be sure: Ukraine seized part of the Kursk region in Russia, giving it Russian land it might be able to trade for Ukrainian territory now under Russian occupation, and North Korea sent troops to the front line, signaling both that Russia has serious allies in the war and that it’s desperate enough to call upon them. But there were no major battlefield breakthroughs, and one of the biggest goals of the Ukrainian military (splitting Russian troops on the Crimean peninsula from troops in the Donbas, the east of Ukraine) did not come to pass. Here is the map of military control I used in last year’s predictions: This is what the map looks like today: If you look carefully, you can see some modest differences between the maps. But overall, they’re nearly identical. The lines of control haven’t moved much in the past year, and with Trump ascending to office and seemingly hostile to extending aid to the Ukrainian military, the future is looking rather grim for Ukrainians defending their sovereignty. —DM I don’t feel too bummed about having erred in my prediction here because the FDA’s rejection came as a surprise to almost everyone involved. When I made this prediction a year ago, patients, therapists, and policymakers alike were anticipating that Lykos Therapeutics, the company trying to get MDMA-assisted therapy approved, would be successful. After all, Lykos had collaborated with the FDA on the trial design, and the latter had signed off on the methodology. But in March, a report raised fresh concerns about the trial design and unreported adverse events. In May and June, more researchers and advocates started to sound the alarm — not just about the psychedelic part of psychedelic-assisted therapy but about the therapy part. Some went so far as to accuse Lykos of being a “therapy cult,” one with a style that could increase risk to patients. Ultimately, the FDA responded to this new information by deciding not to approve Lykos’s application. —SS Did OpenAI release a whole lot of stuff in 2024? It sure did — so much so that the company decided to rebrand 12 days during the holiday season this December as “Shipmas,” releasing everything from ChatGPT Pro (a $200/month plan that includes unlimited access to its top model OpenAI o1) to its video creation model Sora to something called “Santa mode.” The blizzard of product shipping — one matched by competitors like Google and Meta — is a sign of what my colleague Kelsey Piper identified as a shift in AI, away from a single-minded focus on advancing technical progress and toward creating products that people will actually be able to use (and even more importantly, given how expensive frontier AI work is, actually buy). It came as concerns were growing over whether AI was hitting a scaling wall and AI companies were hitting “peak data.” But as I wrote last year, “for the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called ‘ChatGPT-5’ — no ‘ChatGPT-4.5 Turbo’ or whatever.” Whether because it was running out of data or because it didn’t want to lock itself into ever-escalating model versions, OpenAI did not. I’ll take the L. —BW 2024 was a banner year for SpaceX’s Starship, which saw four test launches. The first in March is a difficult case for my prediction: While the launch itself was successful, the booster stage burned up while hurtling back to the ocean and the ship itself appears to have disintegrated at some point. I predicted that neither stage would “explode,” and it’s hard to know if either did in this test. They certainly didn’t operate the way SpaceX had hoped. Luckily for the company, and for my prediction, its three subsequent launches were all smashing successes. In its June 6 launch, the booster and second stage splashed down, intact, in the Gulf of Mexico and Indian Ocean respectively. The November 19 launch, viewed in person by SpaceX founder Elon Musk’s political ally Donald Trump, got the same results. But the one for the history books came on October 13, when the booster stage returned not to the Gulf of Mexico but to the very same launchpad in Texas from whence it came, where it was caught by two massive mechanical “chopsticks.” Whatever else you think about Musk — and I think a lot of negative things — that was a fairly awe-inspiring achievement, and easily met my prediction that the Starship project would notch major successes this year. —DM I biffed this one pretty bad. For quarters one through three of 2024, Cybertruck sales totaled 28,250 in the US. Anecdotally, they seem to be everywhere in Washington, DC. My rationale was that the extremely unusual design of the truck, complete with a metal rather than painted exterior and a truly massive windshield, would prove challenging to produce at scale. Moreover, Tesla tends to operate with extreme delays, which made me pessimistic that it would meet its timelines for the vehicle. Ultimately, though, it’s a company with a lot of experience building EVs at scale, and the Cybertruck proved to be no exception. I did predict, however, that the nearly 4-foot “monowiper” used on the windshield would break down immediately in inclement weather. Guess what? Tesla had to launch a recall in June over exactly this. —DM The industry leader on self-driving cars, a sister company to Google, entered the year operating in San Francisco and Phoenix but had announced plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin. The latter city has seen testing among Waymo’s own employees but is not yet available to the general public through either the Waymo One app or Uber (which has partnered with Waymo in Phoenix). In Los Angeles, however, driverless taxi rides are now widely available: In March, Waymo started letting Angelenos off its waitlist so they could hail rides, and as of November 12, anyone in LA County can use the service, without any waitlist. That fits my prediction that at least one city would see driverless rides become widely accessible the way they already were in SF and Phoenix. —DM Most antibiotics sold in the US don’t go to hospitals or pharmacies, but to farms. These antibiotics are used to make animals grow faster and keep them alive in overcrowded, unsanitary factory farms, and they’ve given rise to new antibiotic-resistant “superbugs.” When humans fall ill from these superbugs, the typical course of antibiotics may not do the trick to heal them. Former Future Perfect fellow Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg called the growth in antibiotic resistance a “hidden epidemic.” Tracking the amount of antibiotics sold to meat producers is a good proxy for understanding whether we’re backsliding or making progress on this epidemic, and last year, I predicted antibiotic sales for livestock would have increased by 1 percent in 2023. Instead, they went down by 2 percent. It makes sense that they declined because beef production decreased by almost 5 percent, and cattle account for around 40 percent of livestock antibiotic sales, while pork production remained stable. (I predicted 2023 sales because data is delayed by about a year.) I more or less knew this would happen, as the US Department of Agriculture predicted decreased beef production, and they’re usually right about these things. Nevertheless, I ignored common sense and predicted livestock antibiotic sales would increase because they had been on the rise for the previous five years. It’s a mistake to assume that trend lines will always continue, and a lesson I’ll incorporate into future predictions. —Kenny Torrella Sadly, I was right on this one. Oatly’s stock has remained below $1.40 all year, hitting a low of just 61 cents in mid-November (it peaked at nearly $29 per share in the summer of 2021). It’s been a long fall from grace for the company that single-handedly made oat milk cool, moving it from the fringes of the dairy aisle to seemingly every coffee shop menu in America. As I wrote about last year, the company has been beset by manufacturing problems and an onslaught of imitators. And it just hit another roadblock: In early December, a UK judge decided that Oatly can’t use the word “milk” on its products after a UK dairy trade group sued the company over the matter. It’s part of a larger trend of the livestock industry’s effort to restrict how plant-based companies can market their products. In brighter news, the company recently reported its third-quarter revenue was up about 10 percent compared to 2023, with growth in the main regions in which it operates. Despite a flagging stock price, Oatly is down but not out. —KT The US egg industry is still headed toward a cage-free future, but in 2024, it moved slower in that direction than I thought it would. Instead of amounting to 45 percent of the egg supply, cage-free reached 40.3 percent, just a 1.5 percent increase from late 2023. I was confident it would reach 45 percent for three reasons: Since 2019, the share of egg-laying hens raised cage-free had been growing by about 5 percent annually, several states had cage-free laws — banning the sale and production of caged eggs — going into effect in 2024, and many large food companies had committed to a 100 percent cage-free egg supply by 2025. Why was I so off? I likely discounted the impact the bird flu has had on the US egg industry; in 2024, the virus resulted in the mass killing of 39.6 million hens — almost triple that of 2023. I was also overconfident on corporate progress; according to the animal protection group the Humane League, many large food companies are behind on fulfilling their cage-free pledges. Lastly, I probably overestimated the impact of the 2024 state laws in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington; each have small egg industries and relatively small populations. We might see the pace of progress accelerate in 2025: The states implementing cage-free laws next year — Michigan and Colorado — have a slightly bigger combined population than the three states from last year and, more importantly, they have much bigger egg industries. Meanwhile, the country’s largest egg producer, Cal-Maine, will have a number of new cage-free farms going online in summer 2025. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak — combined with the unpredictability of corporate pledges — could shift the trajectory. —KT I hate that this is true, but I was right on this one two times over. More than 40 million chickens and turkeys were killed in the poultry industry’s H5N1 bird flu outbreak. And that’s just this year — since the outbreak began in early 2022, over 120 million have been culled. Most of those are not killed by the avian flu itself; rather, any time there’s a single detection of the disease at a poultry facility, all of the birds are exterminated, often with gruesome methods, like literally overheating them to death with industrial heaters. Three years into this never-ending nightmare, both the factory farm industry and animal advocates are faced with the reality that the bird flu may be here to stay. And one disturbing development we couldn’t have predicted last year: H5N1 is now pervasive in another farm animal species, dairy cows, across the country. Next year, I think this disease will keep surprising us. —MB My reasoning here was based on criminal trials being incredibly unpredictable — so while I thought it was more likely that at least one animal rights activist would be incarcerated than any other single outcome, I put the probability at less than 50 percent. The prediction was mostly a product of recency bias: Barely a month before we made our 2024 predictions, Wayne Hsiung, one of the most prominent US animal rights activists and a co-founder of the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), was convicted and sentenced to jail for his involvement in actions at two California factory farms. DxE activists have run many similar actions over the last decade, employing a strategy they call “open rescue,” in which they enter factory farms and other places where animals are exploited, remove a few animals and take them to live at a sanctuary, and invite confrontation with the criminal legal system. The first few criminal cases I covered involving the group ended in either dismissals or miraculous acquittals. But Hsiung’s 2023 jail sentence made it feel like the bill was coming due. This year, I suspected that a long-awaited DxE court case, involving the rescue of three beagles from a company that breeds them for animal testing, would end in prison time because I knew it would be harder for the activists to make a legal argument for acquittal than in farm animal cases. But sure enough, the case was dismissed shortly before trial. More DxE trials are scheduled for next year, but now I know better than to try to predict the outcome. —MB This was a big year for Billie! I didn’t predict her new album or extensive world tour, but it’s not rocket science to know that the academy loves her work. With a previous win for the James Bond theme she did back in 2020, the Song of the Year award was a shoo-in. This year’s Future Perfect 50 honoree and superstar is only missing a Tony and an Emmy for that sweet, sweet EGOT status. —Izzie Ramirez I was wrong on this one — it wound up being Jennifer Lopez who looked beautiful in Schiaparelli. Whichever Kardashian-Jenner decided to read this and prove me wrong: noted. But honestly it’s better this way. J. Lo was a co-chair for the event alongside fashion darling Zendaya, so she needed the extra zhuzh. —IR What did I write last year? “The Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes.” To no one’s surprise, Oppenheimer ran away with the show at the 96th Academy Awards, winning seven Oscars, including Best Actor for Cillian Murphy, Best Director for Christopher Nolan, and yes, Best Picture. Hot dog! So, since explaining why something we knew would happen happened is pretty boring, I’m going to instead discuss an all-time-great Oppenheimer-related query posted on the subreddit r/NoStupidQuestions: Well, Rafe_Cameron_OBX, is it weird that your boyfriend watches Oppenheimer for as much as 15 hours a week? I think it depends on a few things. Does he obsessively watch and rewatch the bravura scene of the Trinity test? Has he started mumbling something about being “death, destroyer of worlds” in his sleep? (Assuming he sleeps.) You say he always makes time for you, which is great, but does he insist on reciting lines from the Bhagavad Gita when he’s, uh, making time? While I’m hesitant to interfere in another person’s relationship, if the answer to any of these questions is “yes,” I strongly suggest you drop him immediately. I’m worried that if he doesn’t get treatment he may progress to a more advanced stage of Christopher Nolanism and start making you watch Interstellar three to five times a week. —BW You don’t have to be Bill James to know that two-way baseball super-duper megastar Shohei Ohtani had a pretty good year in 2024, his first with the Los Angeles Dodgers, even though an elbow injury kept him from pitching. He hit .310, good for fifth in the majors. He recorded 130 RBIs (second in the majors) and had an OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage, the gold standard hitting stat) of 1.036, also good for second in baseball. He became the first player in major league history to hit more than 50 homers and steal more than 50 bases, becoming the only player in the 50/50 club. On September 19, he had what many people consider the single best offensive game in the 121-year history of Major League Baseball, going 6-for-6 with three home runs, two doubles, 10 RBIs, and two stolen bases. Oh, and he went on to win a championship, too. The one thing Ohtani did not do is the one thing I predicted he would do: lead the major leagues in home runs in 2024. Ohtani mashed 54 taters, which would have been good enough to at least tie for the majors lead in all but three of the past 24 seasons. Unfortunately, very big boy Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees took the crown this season with 58 home runs. I’ll admit, my mistake here was forgetting that as spectacular as Ohtani is across the board in baseball, the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge is really, really good at mashing dingers, at least in the regular season. He flamed out in his championship series against Ohtani’s Dodgers, going 4-for-18 with just one homer and three RBIs, enraging Yankees fans across the country. So even though my prediction failed, I’d say advantage: Ohtani. —BW Correction, January 2, 2025, 10:25 AM ET: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of hens killed in the break flu outbreak in 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year — making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks edged higher on Thursday to kick off the first day of trading of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) hovered near the flatline traders returned from Wednesday's holiday shutdown. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." But the decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years of over-20% gains in a row — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades.

January 02, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO and MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ today announced distributions for the YieldMax™ ETFs listed in the table below. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs.” You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund's objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. ZEGA Financial is the sub-adviser for all YieldMax™ETFs other than FEAT and FIVY. THE FUND, TRUST, AND SUB-ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Returns from the tech-focused Nasdaq have frequently been impressive. Photo / Getty Images If you invested in the stock market in 2024, chances are you came out pretty well. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite index rose to record highs, as investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence fueled a massive bull run, and investors cheered the Federal Reserve’s shift to lower interest rates. Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans also benefited big, with Fidelity Investments reporting that account balances reached their highest averages on record. The stock market soared despite Americans’ widespread discontent with the economy, highlighting a disconnect between the experiences of many US households and the performance of their investments. US markets outperformed those in Europe and Asia: The S&P 500 gained 23% this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 13%, and the STOXX Europe 600 moved up 6%, earlier this week. The strong performance also came amid expectations of an economic slowdown in 2024. “There were real concerns over the summer about whether we were once again heading for a hard landing and/or a recession,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. But in a way, those fears came at a good time, Bespoke Investment co-founder Paul Hickey said, because it helped push the Fed to ease monetary policy. “It almost panicked the Fed into cutting 50 basis points at its annual meeting” in September, Hickey said. Markets rallied further late in 2024, fuelled by what analysts say was exuberance over the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term. The president-elect punctuated the “Trump trade” when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in December, though stocks fell days later on signals that the Fed, rather than cutting interest rates further, planned to leave them at their current level for longer than many observers had expected. Here are the highlights of a momentous year in stocks. The S&P 500′s record gains in the first half of 2024 were driven by seven tech stocks that significantly outperformed the other companies on the index. The “Magnificent Seven” - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla - have an outsize effect on the S&P 500 because the index is weighted by market capitalisation, a shorthand for companies’ size and value. The rest of the index started to catch up in the latter half of the year, a rally that showed “it’s not just seven companies driving the entire economy,” Hickey said. But the technology and AI sectors continued to dominate investors’ attention. And no stock captured their enthusiasm like AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose earnings calls have inspired rapturous takes from traders and casual investors alike. “Every bull market has a theme, and the theme of this bull market has been AI,” Hickey said. Chris Rupkey, with Fwdbonds, said Nvidia’s juggernaut status has made it something of a bellwether for the broader market. “Follow the bouncing ball of Nvidia,” he said in August. “Nvidia down, sell everything. Nvidia up, buy it all.” Nvidia’s growth has slowed in recent months and its stock has taken temporary hits after strong earnings reports, as analysts set exceedingly hard-to-meet expectations and some raise concerns that rampant spending on AI is creating a financial bubble. But some analysts say Nvidia will have staying power and catalyse further investment in AI. “This is the fourth industrial revolution playing out across tech,” said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. “It’s led by Mag 7, but now software and cybersecurity players are getting in.” US stocks dipped, then surged, after the Fed cut interest rates by a half-percentage point in September, easing monetary policy for the first time since March 2020 amid signs that inflation was moderating. That, in turn, boosted consumer sentiment and took the edge off interest rates. “A funny thing kind of happened on the way to the recession and or economic slowdown that we all anticipated, which is basically that the [middle- and high-income] consumer just never flinched,” Samana said. US stocks jumped on the news that Trump would return to the White House after campaigning on promises to slash regulations. Companies expected to benefit under the Trump administration - such as private prison company Geo Group and Tesla, which is led by Trump adviser Elon Musk - leaped while renewable energy and pharmaceutical stocks sank in the immediate aftermath. But Hickey said the conventional wisdom about winners and losers in the market doesn’t always pan out when it comes to politics. “Coming into the first Trump administration, you would have thought the energy sector would have done well,” he said. “It was the worst performing sector.” Looking ahead, Hickey expects the industrial sector will perform well in 2025, especially if loosened regulations help lingering construction projects break ground - such as renewable energy proposals green-lit by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. “Whether it was Trump or Biden that was elected president, the overall trend in the economy is to bring more production back to the United States,” Hickey said. The biggest wild card going into 2025 is tariffs, said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar. Trump has said he intends to impose a blanket tariffs on imports, but it’s unclear what countries or sectors would be covered and how much of the promise is campaign rhetoric. Bitcoin had a massive year - and that was especially reflected in the share price of MicroStrategy, a business software company that has snapped up several billions of dollars in bitcoin. The company’s stock is up more than 340% year to date, with much of those gains coming after the presidential election. Bitcoin itself began the year with a massive boost, as the Securities and Exchange Commission approved exchange-traded funds tied to the price of bitcoin. In the following months, bitcoin’s price nearly doubled, from around US$40,000 per coin in January to about US$73,000 per coin in March. The price largely held steady until Trump was elected to a second term. After the November election, bitcoin’s price soared and at one point surpassed US$100,000 per coin, a milestone cheered by the cryptocurrency community. The first and most valuable cryptocurrency is up more than 120%. . While Magnificent Seven stocks received big publicity this year, a few lesser-known companies dwarfed their gains - at least when it came to growth. Sezzle, a “buy now, pay later” company, is up more than 1000% on the year, with much of its gains coming after the November election, though some of those gains were wiped out in December when an activist short-selling firm released a report accusing the company of risky lending practices. Shares in NuScale Power, a nuclear power company focused on small modular reactors, is up more than 450% on the year. The rise reflects investor excitement over the transition to low-carbon energy sources, particularly new technologies such as NuScale’s designs. AppLovin, a mobile app development and marketing company, also had a banner year on Wall Street, with the companies’ shares up more than 700% on the year. Analysts say the company has been able to wield AI to more effectively market apps. It was a soft start to the year on worries about higher bond rates.

If you believe in the work we do at Vox, please support us by becoming a member. Our mission has never been more urgent. But our work isn’t easy. It requires resources, dedication, and independence. And that’s where you come in. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? From tariffs and a Trump/Elon break-up to artificial general intelligence, here’s what could happen in 2025, according to the Future Perfect team. by Dylan Matthews, Bryan Walsh, Marina Bolotnikova, Kenny Torrella, Izzie Ramirez, and Dylan Scott For the sixth year in a row, the staff of Future Perfect convened in December to make predictions about major events in the year to come. Will Congress pass a tariff bill that makes President-elect Donald Trump happy? Will the H5N1 bird flu become an honest-to-god pandemic? Will the war in Ukraine stop? Will a major sports figure get caught up in a gambling scandal? It’s fun to make predictions about the future, which is part of the reason why we do it so often. But this isn’t just blind guessing. Each prediction comes with a probability attached to it. That gives you a sense of our confidence (high in the case of, say, Charli XCX’s Grammy chances, less so in the case of Iran’s nuclear plans). And don’t make the same mistake that people seem to make every presidential cycle. Even a probability as high as 75 percent or 80 percent doesn’t mean we’re sure something will happen. Rather, it means we think that if we made four or five predictions, we’d expect three or four of them to come true, respectively. And as we have every year, we’ll be keeping track of how our predictions fared over the course of 2025, and report back to you at the end of December. You can check out how we did in 2024 here. And we’ve done something new this year in partnering with the prediction platform Metaculus. You can check it out here to see how the community there came down on a number of our predictions — and even compete in a prize pool — and click on the individual questions with links to go directly to them on Metaculus. We’ve also added the Metaculus community’s aggregated forecasts as of December 31 for the questions they’ve taken on. —Bryan Walsh Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign was perhaps the most pro-tariff of any candidate since William McKinley: He promised 60 percent taxes on imports from China, and 10 percent on everywhere else. In victory he’s only gotten bolder, calling for 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico, in flagrant violation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a free trade deal made by some past president named Donald Trump. The bad news for consumers and the world economy is that Trump has substantial discretion to impose tariffs as president without consulting Congress. But that discretion isn’t unlimited, and probably doesn’t permit the kind of 10 percent across-the-board tariff Trump promised. Plus, Republicans want a revenue source to help offset the cost of making Trump’s 2017 tax cuts permanent before they expire at the end of next year. This raises the question: Will Congress pass a tariff measure on its own that not only implements Trump’s ideas, but lets them endure under future presidents? My guess is no. There was a time in the distant past, let’s call it “2015,” when Republicans were the party of free markets and free trade, and some members of Congress haven’t forgotten that. Early reporting suggests that many GOP figures in the House and Senate are hostile to the idea of including tariffs in a tax package. Republicans can only lose three senators and two House members out of their caucus and still pass bills, which gives them very little margin for error, and makes it very difficult to pass legislation that splits the caucus like tariffs. Two caveats, though. One, I’m predicting about a tariff bill and not new unilateral tariffs from Trump because I think the odds that Trump does new tariffs using presidential authority are nearly 100 percent. Two, the only reason my estimate isn’t lower is that there’s been some bipartisan interest in a “carbon border adjustment,” or a sort of carbon tax that only applies to imported goods. The idea has gotten Republican support because while it does acknowledge that global warming is real, it also sticks it to foreigners. That’s a tariff, and I think the likeliest kind to make it into a tax package (though I still bet against it). —Dylan Matthews Metaculus aggregated forecast: 7 percent Something I love and hate about American politics is that big weighty-seeming questions, like “Can Donald Trump fulfill his campaign promise to abolish the Department of Education?” turn out to hinge on much weirder and more technical questions, like “Will the Senate parliamentarian rule a departmental reorganization as ineligible for the reconciliation process under the Byrd rule?” The Department of Education, whose main duties are administering student loans and financial aid for higher-ed institutions and distributing funds (around $39 billion in 2023) to local schools under programs like Title I (for poor districts) and IDEA (for disabled students), was created in a 1979 act of Congress. Passing a normal bill repealing that act would require 60 Senate votes to break a filibuster, which means winning over seven Democrats to the idea, which isn’t going to happen. So legislation abolishing the department (already written by GOP Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota) would have to pass through budget reconciliation, which lets certain legislation pass with a mere majority in the Senate. But reconciliation has strict requirements limiting the content of legislation that can be passed that way, and in particular provisions of bills that are only “incidentally” related to the overall level of spending or taxing tend to be struck down by the Senate parliamentarian as contrary to the Byrd rule, the main governing principle behind the reconciliation process. Rounds’s bill, notably, doesn’t eliminate the Department of Education’s actual functions. It just moves them around. Student loans, for instance, would go to the Treasury Department, and the Department of Labor would get vocational programs. This strikes me as an archetypal example of a change that is merely incidental to the actual level of spending, and that can’t be done with reconciliation. Will the Senate parliamentarian disagree with me? Possibly. But also, in part because this move is so much more about reorganization than the actual substance of the department’s programs, I am very skeptical that Republicans are going to go to the mat on this one. If they can only win so many fights with the parliamentarian, are they going to prioritize changing the mailing address of the student loan office? I doubt it. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 4 percent From the moment the Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, the Republican Party has been obsessed with repealing it. They even shut down the government over it. Then, in 2017, the dog finally caught the car: Republicans had both houses of Congress and the presidency, and in theory the opportunity to repeal the law. They didn’t. Sure, the tax law that year eliminated the individual mandate to get health insurance, but that turned out to not be as important to getting people coverage as the ACA’s authors thought. The rest of the bill — its dramatic Medicaid expansions, rules protecting people with preexisting conditions and letting young adults stay on their parents’ insurance, subsidies for individuals to buy health insurance if their employer doesn’t provide it — remained intact. Even “skinny repeal,” a bill that zeroed out only a handful of provisions of the law, failed to pass the Senate when John McCain made his famous thumbs-down gesture, but matters had only even gotten to that point because several other senators didn’t want to vote for sweeping Medicaid cuts, like those entailed by simply repealing the ACA in its entirety. Will they try again in 2025? I’m skeptical. And here, by “repeal Obamacare,” I don’t even necessarily mean repealing all of it. To qualify as repeal, a bill has to do at least three of the following five things: Yes, Trump’s budgets and those that his past and future budget chief Russ Vought prepared during the Biden years did propose undoing the ACA’s coverage expansions, and then cutting Medicaid still further. I anticipate they will continue to make these proposals. But I am doubtful that with a much narrower House majority than they had in 2017, and an equally narrow Senate majority, Republicans will be able to pass cuts on a scale that they couldn’t get off the ground eight years ago. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 10 percent Here are the facts: Jerome Powell’s term as chair of the Federal Reserve expires on May 15, 2026. He has pledged to stay on as chair until that time, though not necessarily to remain as a member of the Board of Governors until his term there expires in 2028. Donald Trump has said he does not plan to fire Powell before that time. Powell has insisted that the president does not legally have the power to fire him before his term is up, and that he will refuse to obey such an order. In many ways, 10 percent seems too high, because the odds that a 71-year-old man dies in the next year are only 2.9 percent, and I have an easier time envisioning Powell dying in office than acquiescing to a firing. But I should also fess up to a personal bias here. Jay Powell is, by a wide margin, the greatest chair of the Federal Reserve that the institution has ever had, and perhaps the greatest central banker in any nation of modern times. He prevented Covid from spiraling into a global financial crisis, oversaw an astonishingly rapid recovery of employment and economic growth in the pandemic’s aftermath, and managed a “soft landing” that ended an inflationary episode without having to spark a recession. He is a miraculous figure who we do not deserve, and for my own sanity I need him to stick around. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 8 percent Americans have a charming habit of deciding to like the newly elected president as soon as the election’s over, and Donald Trump’s favorability rating has gone from 8.6 points underwater on Election Day to only 1.9 points negative on December 19. (By “favorability rating,” I mean the difference between the share of voters saying they view him favorably minus the share saying they view him unfavorably. Once he’s president, I’ll count this prediction as resolving to “true” if either his favorability or job approval ratings are positive; while similar, these aren’t exactly the same question.) But how long do presidential “honeymoon” periods last? Not very long, as it turns out. Back in 2022, FiveThirtyEight’s Geoffrey Skelley and Jean Yi crunched the data and found that Obama, Trump I, and Biden alike all saw their approval ratings dip below 50 percent by the end of the first year (Trump was never even above 50 when he started!): The two exceptions on the chart are Bill Clinton, who saw a curious fall and then recovery over 1993 that I don’t really understand, and George W. Bush, whose first year included 9/11. I think the odds of another 9/11 are mercifully low, and the trend appears to be toward lower approval for presidents in their first year in recent times. Moreover, Trump is unusually loathed by a huge segment of the population and is promising massive tariffs that I suspect will prove unpopular once they start raising the prices of everyday household items. So I feel pretty good predicting Trump will be below water at year’s end. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 17 percent “Still friends” is obviously a subjective category but I like the prediction markets guru Nathan Young’s proposed definition: if one or the other publicly and unambiguously disparages his counterpart at least three times. Luckily for us, Trump and Musk are not subtle or taciturn men, and when they dislike someone they have a tendency to scream that loudly many, many times, so I don’t anticipate it being hard to decide where they stand at the end of 2025. The list of one-time Trump allies who eventually came to denounce him is too long to include in full here, but let us briefly remember, say, 10: Anthony Scaramucci; Mike Pence; John Kelly; John Bolton; HR McMaster; Stephanie Grisham; Alyssa Farah Griffin; Betsy DeVos; and of course Michael Cohen. It does not seem like an ambitious prediction that Musk will eventually join their ranks. His role as the head of the new Department of Government Efficiency seems guaranteed to put him on a collision course with Trump’s Cabinet officials and with congressional Republicans, and probably also with his cochair Vivek Ramaswamy. Trump might side with Musk each time — but he’s always been more pragmatic about spending policy than the cut-happy Musk seems, and there are ripe opportunities for conflict. What if Musk wants to slash Medicare and Social Security, which Trump has promised to defend? What if he wants defense cuts and Trump wants a tougher posture toward China? What if Musk pushes for reconciliation with China, with whose government he is extremely close (Ramaswamy once called Musk “a circus monkey” working for Xi Jinping)? I won’t predict the exact inciting episode that causes Trump and Musk to fall out. But I feel like I know how these guys operate, and I think it’s more likely than not that they will fall out. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 35 percent Last year, I correctly predicted that more than 40,000 Americans would be killed by cars in 2023 (according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s estimates, which are released with a lag the following year). Since the 1960s, the US has seen rapid, dramatic progress in cutting its car fatality rate, and 2007 was the last year that over 40,000 Americans were killed by our car-dependent transportation system — until the Covid-19 pandemic. You would think that fewer people driving would mean fewer car crash deaths, but not so in America, where our dangerously designed roads lead to more speeding and death when there’s less traffic. Ever since, America’s rate of death by cars has sat at levels that should honestly be humiliating for such a rich country. These numbers are slowly starting to come back down. NHTSA recently estimated that for the first half of 2024, car crash deaths were down 3.2 percent from 2023. If the same trend from 2023 carries over to the second half of 2024, total 2024 car fatalities will come in at a hair under 40,000. It’s far from guaranteed, because car crash patterns vary significantly across different seasons. And that number would still be nothing to write home about — but in a country so thoroughly built around automobiles, getting deaths back under 40,000 would be a milestone worth celebrating. —Marina Bolotnikova Metaculus aggregated forecast: 81 percent What a difference a year makes. In December 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was incredibly unpopular, his image severely damaged by his government’s total failure to anticipate the deadly October 7 attacks by Hamas. Polls indicated his Likud party might win only 17 of 120 seats in Israel’s Knesset. Israel was on its way to becoming an international pariah because of the destructive way it was waging its war in Gaza, and Israelis were furious about the government’s failure to rescue the hostages held by Hamas, even after a November 2023 deal to bring some home. Oh, and Netanyahu was only a few months removed from massive street protests and was facing corruption charges. Fast-forward to December 2024, and polls suggest Netanyahu’s Likud party would win 25 seats if elections were held today, more than any other party. Israel has all but destroyed Hezbollah, by far its most capable opponent, and has isolated Iran, arguably its most existential threat. After the sudden fall of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, Israel has even captured territory formerly under the Syrian government’s control. And President Joe Biden, who at least occasionally pushed back against Netanyahu, is about to be replaced by President-elect Donald Trump, who has signaled that he will happily give Israel a freer hand in Gaza. Netanyahu has been prime minister of Israel for roughly 17 of the past 28 years. Every time it seems like he’s in an unwinnable position, he seems to find a way to wriggle out of it. I have every expectation that will continue in 2025. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 75 percent Americans got pretty upset about inflation in the aftermath of the Covid pandemic, but we’ve got nothing on our Argentinian friends: Here in the US, we’re such babies that we’ll complain about 6 percent to 7 percent inflation. In Argentina, double-digit annual inflation rates were normal even before the pandemic. Annual inflation hit triple digits and started what looked like an exponential climb, still ongoing when left-wing Peronist Alberto Fernández left office. Javier Milei, a chainsaw-wielding self-described anarcho-capitalist who named his dogs after the libertarian economists Milton Friedman, Murray Rothbard, and Robert Lucas, initiated shock therapy upon taking office this year, eliminating price controls and subsidies for things like fuel and food, as well as massively devaluing the peso. That made prices surge even more massively at first (which you can see in the chart above). But since then they’ve been subsiding. The price surge had the salutary effect of easing the government’s debt burden, and the nation’s budget went into surplus for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. This has come at a considerable cost, with poverty and unemployment spiking, and the economy as a whole in recession for much of the year. But now that the recession is over and the country is seeing both cooling inflation and a growing economy, a sadly unusual combo down in Buenos Aires. That said, I don’t think we’re going to see the country get down to a 30 percent annual inflation rate in 2024. The 12-month inflation rate in November 2024 was 166 percent, down 27 points from the month before. If the rate keeps falling at that pace, the country will hit the 30 percent mark in five months. But I think progress against inflation will slow as the initial shock of Milei’s policies subsides and pressure for wage hikes intensifies in a country that’s finally growing again. The IMF anticipates annual inflation hitting a low of 45 percent next year, and I think that’s a reasonable guess. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 55 percent The war in Ukraine is just short of its third anniversary. The very fact that Ukraine has continued to fight this long defies most early prognosticators, many of whom expected the government in Kyiv to collapse not long after the Russians invaded. (An exception there, as Future Perfect readers know, is the State Department’s perspicacious Bureau of Intelligence and Research.) But the longer the war goes on, the more Russia’s sheer size and willingness to sacrifice unbelievable numbers of soldiers has outweighed Ukraine’s ability to fight back, even with the material support of the US and European allies. President Biden has mostly been a steadfast ally, but he’ll be leaving office on January 20, replaced by Donald Trump, who has made no secret of the fact that he has little interest in continuing to support Ukraine. Both sides are still fighting hard to gain and protect territory, but it seems clear that’s being done by both Ukraine and Russia to put themselves in the best possible position before expected peace talks. Exactly what form that will take is difficult to predict, and a ceasefire doesn’t mean a permanent peace. But I would be shocked to not see a durable pause in the fighting some time in 2025. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 44 percent For the purposes of this prediction, “getting nuclear weapons” means producing enough fissile material to fuel a nuclear weapon. Actually producing a usable nuclear weapon — including miniaturizing a warhead enough to fit on a missile — might take another several months to a year or more, and thus probably falls outside the 2025 time frame. Iran is already on the brink of sufficient enrichment — estimates are that it would only take about a week for Iran to enrich enough uranium for five fission weapons. So the question here is primarily one of international politics. Iran had a terrible 2024. It directly attacked Israel with missiles twice, only to see both salvos largely neutralized by missile defense systems, while Israel’s own retaliatory attack on Iran was far more successful. The Lebanese militia Hezbollah, Iran’s most powerful proxy, was all but annihilated by Israel, which continues to operate in parts of southern Lebanon. And the return of Donald Trump brings a president into office whom Iran has been accused of trying to assassinate. Put that all together, and the Iranian regime finds itself in a very insecure place, and may look to nuclear weapons as a way to level the playing field. At the same time, relatively new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has made overtures to the West and seems to understand that the only path to economic relief for his country is a new deal that limits the nuclear program in exchange for easing economic sanctions. The Iranian regime’s number one priority is its own survival, and my best guess is that they will decide that the risk of going full speed on a nuclear program isn’t worth it, at least for another year. (There’s also the possibility that accelerating its nuclear work could lead to a military intervention by Israel or the US that would stop the program in its tracks.) So I think on balance that Iran won’t join the nuclear club in 2025 — though it’s not a prediction I make with a great deal of certainty. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 8 percent First off, some math. While it may feel as if infectious disease pandemics have become a regular occurrence, they still remain highly rare. Since 1918, there have been five influenza pandemics: the Spanish flu of that year, the 1957 Asian flu, the 1968 Hong Kong flu, the 1977 Russian flu, and the 2009 swine flu. That gives a naive percentage of about 5 percent for any given year. But there’s evidence that outbreaks of new infectious diseases are increasing, as the Covid pandemic amply demonstrated. And the H5N1 avian flu has been infecting a growing variety and number of animals, and more recently, people. On December 18, California, where 34 human cases of the virus have been detected, became the first state to institute a state of emergency over bird flu. New research suggests just a single mutation could be enough to potentially increase the virus’s ability to spread from person to person, which would be a prerequisite to becoming a pandemic. (Right now, H5N1 only rarely seems to be able to spread between people, and only in very limited fashion.) So why am I mostly pessimistic about H5N1’s ability to truly break out, which for the purposes of this prediction would mean the WHO officially declaring it a pandemic, which would require sustained human transmission over multiple regions? Not because we’re doing a great job containing it — we definitely are not. Rather, it’s personal experience. I’ve been covering H5N1 since it began really spilling over in Southeast Asia in 2004. I’ve been to backyard chicken farms in Indonesia and virology labs in Hong Kong. I’ve watched this virus as closely as any other subject I’ve covered in nearly a quarter-century as a professional journalist, and I just don’t think H5N1 has it. Call it a hunch, and one I hope will hold true. —BW Metaculus aggregated forecast: 26 percent For precision, let me clarify that by “major lab” I mean any of the following companies: This is a purposefully broad list and includes companies that haven’t made it a priority to be on the bleeding edge of deep learning (like Netflix) and ones whose primary business isn’t in developing their own models so much as hosting or enabling models that others create (like Scale or Hugging Face). But, you know, I thought Nvidia wasn’t in this race until it dropped a massive model in October with impressive benchmarks, so a lot of things can change quickly in the world of AI. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a vague term, and there is a large and growing literature in which AI researchers seek merely to define it, let alone to predict what it would look like or mean. That said, most definitions rely on an analogy to humans: an AI will be generally intelligent if it can do everything a human being can do, as well as a human being can, including meta-tasks like learning to complete new tasks. This idea itself has holes in it. Different human beings can do different things — I cannot do everything, say, Katie Ledecky can do. Luckily for us, the prediction here doesn’t require us to know what AGI means. It just requires a major firm to claim to have achieved it, accurately or not. One OpenAI staffer took to X this past year to claim that the firm’s models had already gotten there (though, importantly, the company itself has not made claims that grand). So if the bar is that low, why do I think we’ll make it through the year without a company making this claim? Mostly because a) this is a young field where firm reputation matters a ton and being discredited by a premature AGI announcement might make the difference between a company ending up like Apple and ending up like Atari, and b) this is the kind of technology where premature claims can be discredited really, really fast. If a nuclear fusion company claims to have achieved net energy gain, it is very difficult for me, a non-nuclear physicist, to tell if they’re bluffing. It’s not like I can use the nuclear reactor. But an AGI would presumably come with text, video, audio, and other interfaces that average consumers could try out and use, and it’d be immediately clear if some AI firm claimed to have gotten there when they hadn’t. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast: 20 percent I’m not really a fan of private cars (see my other car-related prediction above), and I wish our solution to climate change was to just have fewer of them. But this is America, so we have to work within the maddeningly car-dependent cage of our own creation. Electric cars are obviously better for society in most respects (though not all — their heavy weight means they’re more dangerous to pedestrians, cyclists, and anyone outside the vehicle), so I grudgingly have to welcome the EV transition that’s finally picking up. By the third quarter of 2024, EVs made up 8.9 percent of new car sales in the US, according to an analysis by Kelley Blue Book. There’ve been reports that electric car sales are slowing, but given their consistent past growth rates, plus the fact that interest rates are coming down, I think we’ll hit 10 percent by the same time this year without much trouble. Donald Trump’s promise to do sweeping tariffs could throw a wrench in all that, but given my colleague Dylan Matthews’s prediction about the unlikelihood of that happening, I won’t calibrate my prediction around it too much. —MB Metaculus aggregated forecast: 67 percent The digital gold rush probably still hasn’t reached full frenzy, believe it or not. Bitcoin recently topped $100,000 in value for the first time, but we are going to have to think bigger. I think it’s going to double its value in the next 12 months — and I’m not the only one. This is not an endorsement, to be clear; I own no bitcoin. When I read Warren Buffett still believes Bitcoin is a fad, that people do “stupid things” and this will be the latest trend in fiscal speculation to end in failure, I take it seriously. The case for bitcoin remains muddied, at least to me. But Buffett has also compared bitcoin to gambling and, well, the gambling business is booming. Even if Bitcoin is a questionable long-term investment — don’t forget it dropped below $20,000 in late 2022 — people can still get a kick out of the continued accumulation of value, and that’s the basis of any bubble. It helps that Donald Trump and the crew he’s bringing back to Washington have gone all in on the crypto craze; they are likely to do whatever they can to stoke the speculation further. Bitcoin just saw its value more than double over the course of 2024. I think it’s more likely than not it’ll repeat the feat with those winds at its back. —Dylan Scott Metaculus aggregated forecast: 20 percent My source here is the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Since the 2012 inception of the Bloomberg list, the occupant of the top spot has changed five times. In 2013, surging Microsoft shares enabled Bill Gates to beat out Mexican telecom mogul Carlos Slim, who led the list at its outset. In 2017, Amazon shares put Jeff Bezos ahead of Gates. The massive rally around Tesla led in January 2021 to Elon Musk deposing Bezos. But Louis Vuitton chief Bernard Arnault overtook him in October 2022 in part because Musk had to sell much of his Tesla fortune to finance his purchase of Twitter. But by May of the following year, Musk was back on top. “Will Elon Musk still be the richest person in the world throughout 2024?” is actually two separate questions: one, will he be dethroned by anyone in the next year; two, will he live through the year? Normally the latter wouldn’t be a concern for a 53-year-old man with access to the best health care money can buy, but Musk is, uh, not the most stable person on earth. So I’d put maybe a 5 percent probability he loses the title by way of the Grim Reaper. Five switches in the top ranking over 12.5 years of the Bloomberg ranking existing implies, naively, a 40 percent chance that the top rank will switch in any given year. There’s tons of fluctuation within the top 10 even in a given month, as these net worths are hugely dependent on stock returns. Jensen Huang of Nvidia, currently ranked 12th, gained $73.4 billion in 2024 alone, by far the biggest part of his $117 billion fortune. It’s sobering to return to the 2013 article on Gates overtaking Slim, which notes at the bottom an up-and-comer named Elon Musk, whose car company brought him up to a net worth of $5.4 billion. Today, it’s $455 billion. Life moves pretty fast. Anyway, 40 percent odds that Musk is overtaken by another billionaire plus 5 percent odds he dies = 45 percent odds that he is no longer the richest man, and 55 percent odds that he still is. One exception to my policy of relying on Bloomberg here: hilariously, Bloomberg refuses to include Michael Bloomberg in its ranking, but should Bloomberg, LP’s value surge or Mike otherwise become the richest person in the world according to the Forbes World’s Billionaire List or some other reliable source, I’ll consider Musk dethroned, even if Bloomberg itself refuses to report on its leader’s riches. —DM Metaculus aggregated forecast; 85 percent Last year was an eventful one in the saga of psychedelics seeking a return to mainstream medicine. Roughly 38 years of planning came to a head when Lykos Therapeutics — a for-profit outgrowth of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, founded in 1986 — submitted an application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MDMA therapy to treat PTSD. Despite widespread expectations it would succeed, the FDA did not grant approval, unsettling psychedelic companies, advocates, and the industry at large. The FDA didn’t outright reject the application, but asked for another Phase 3 clinical trial, which will likely take a couple of years to complete and resubmit to the FDA. With Lykos going back to the drawing board, who’s going to take the next swing at FDA approval? My prediction: no one, at least not in 2025. At the moment, there aren’t many other companies with Phase 3 trials underway. Two of the closest behind Lykos are in the midst of trials looking at psilocybin to treat depression — Compass Pathways and the Usona Institute. Compass launched its trial in January 2023, but delayed a top-line readout of its results and cut 30 percent of its staff after the FDA’s decision on Lykos. They don’t expect to complete the study until February of 2026. Usona launched its Phase 3 trial in March 2024 and doesn’t anticipate completing the study — let alone putting together a new drug application and submitting it to the FDA — until April 2026. We certainly won’t see any companies announce a Phase 3 trial, complete it, and package the findings into an application to the FDA all within the span of one year. So it’s difficult to imagine any pathway toward an FDA approval in 2025. There are still some slightly cracked backdoors that could usher psilocybin into accepted medical use within the year, like the FDA granting an emergency use authorization, which could even force the holy grail of a true psychedelic renaissance — rescheduling it to a lower category of the Controlled Substances Act — before getting FDA approval. So while I think the chances of normal FDA approval in 2025 are basically zero, considering the EUA backdoor, plus the general state of accelerating weirdness of the world these days, bumps my estimate up to 20 percent that we wind up with any federally authorized medical use of a new psychedelic drug in 2025. —Oshan Jarow Metaculus aggregated forecast: 33 percent I just wrote a long story about why the concept of “ultra-processed foods” is kind of BS — it’s overly broad, arbitrary, and even liable to vilify foods that are good for us. It does not make sense as a policymaking tool. The scientific panel that’s advising the creation of the 2025–2030 federal dietary guidelines, due out this year, acknowledged as much in December, when it concluded that there’s not much reliable evidence linking ultra-processed foods to poor health outcomes. The final dietary guidelines, which are jointly created by the US Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services and play an important role in shaping federal nutrition programs like National School Lunch, often aren’t fully aligned with the scientific committee’s recommendations. But where they differ, it’s often to benefit powerful food industries, like the meat industry and producers of sugary snacks. And a sweeping recommendation against ultra-processed foods would be consistent with neither nutrition science nor corporate interests. So whatever the hype about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cracking down on ultra-processed foods, I expect the final document to come to more or less the same conclusion as the science. —MB Most of the antibiotics used in human medicine are actually sold to meat companies, which put them in animals’ feed to make them grow faster and prevent disease outbreaks in factory farms. But some bacteria on farms are becoming resistant to these antibiotics, giving way to new strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria that make the drugs less effective in treating humans. It’s a huge public health threat, and experts have warned that we ought to rein in antibiotic use in the meat industry. Last year, I predicted that livestock antibiotics sales would increase by 2 percent in 2023, but instead, they declined by 1 percent. (Data on sales lags by about a year.) I erred in giving too much weight to past trends, as antibiotic sales to the livestock industry had been on the rise for years. Instead, I should’ve used projected meat production as a rough proxy for livestock antibiotic sales. Doing so this time around, antibiotic sales to meat producers should have increased in 2024 by around 0.83 percent, given that beef production is expected to remain stable, pork production will increase by a few percentage points, and turkey production will decrease by a few percentage points. There are numerous factors that could result in my guesstimate being off, such as disease prevalence and corporations reducing antibiotic use due to consumer pressure. For the sake of safeguarding one of humanity’s greatest inventions — antibiotics — I hope I’m wrong. —Kenny Torrella Metaculus aggregated forecast: 50 percent Since early 2022, 112 million poultry birds — mostly turkeys and egg-laying hens — have been violently killed in an effort to slow the spread of a bird flu outbreak that has roiled the poultry industry for nearly three years now. The first year was the worst, with almost 58 million birds killed. Things slowed down a bit in 2023, with 21.8 million poultry birds dead, but then worsened in 2024, with 41 million birds killed as of mid-December. I predict at least another 30 million will die in 2025. It’s incredibly difficult to make predictions for such an unpredictable disease, so I’m pegging my confidence level at a meek 60 percent. But it’s reasonable to think that the Trump administration will handle the situation in a similarly poor fashion to the Biden administration’s bungled, industry-friendly response, allowing the virus to circulate freely among livestock and wildlife. The US Department of Agriculture has been testing vaccines for poultry birds and dairy cows. However, it’s unclear when they’ll be ready and, more importantly, whether they’ll be deployed, because using them could disrupt trade, and both industry and the USDA don’t want that to happen. —KT Metaculus aggregated forecast: 96 percent For six years, the US pork industry has been looking for a way to get rid of California’s Proposition 12, a landmark animal welfare law, passed by ballot measure in 2018, that outlawed certain forms of extreme confinement on factory farms. That included a ban on the sale of pork raised using gestation crates — tiny cages in which pregnant pigs are kept continually, barely given any room to move. The practice, as we wrote last year, is “equivalent to living your entire, short life pregnant and trapped inside a coffin.” Having failed to convince courts, including the US Supreme Court, of their legal arguments for overturning the law, pork giants are now trying to get Congress to nullify Prop 12 through the Farm Bill, a massive legislative package passed every five years that shapes much of US food and farming policy. Last May, the House Agriculture Committee advanced a Republican-led Farm Bill that includes just such a measure. Always live to serve. At the time, I didn’t think this version of the bill would go anywhere. This year, Congress will need to finally pass the long-delayed Farm Bill, and with a majority in both chambers, Republicans’ chances of axing Prop 12 will be much greater. Still, I don’t really see it happening, in part because some members of the Freedom Caucus oppose it as a severe limit on states’ ability to set their own policies. Much like their long-promised efforts to trash the Affordable Care Act, Republicans love to talk about repealing stuff but rarely follow through. —MB Metaculus aggregated forecast: 78 percent Earlier this year, Florida and Alabama banned the production and sale of “lab-grown” or “cell-cultivated” meat. Cell-cultivated meat is real meat but made without slaughtering animals — instead, startups take animal cells, place them in a large steel tank, and feed them a mix of ingredients, like sugars, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids, for several weeks until they can be harvested as meat. The bans were transparent efforts to protect the respective states’ livestock industries and score political points by further pulling meat into America’s culture war. It’s a somewhat hollow victory for the culture warriors and red state governors — cell-cultivated meat is still incredibly expensive to produce and has only been sold in small batches for limited runs at a handful of US restaurants. It’s an emerging technology, and there’s still uncertainty as to whether the startups that make it will be able to scale their operations to produce a meaningful amount of meat. But if they do figure it out, these bans could be a real headache in the future, both for the companies’ bottom lines and America’s climate goals, as cell-cultivated meat has potential to cut agricultural greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, lawmakers in other states are lining up behind Florida and Alabama to pass their own bans, including in Arizona, Michigan, Tennessee, and Illinois. Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has said he plans to work with state lawmakers to introduce a ban in the next legislative session. I think the likelihood that at least one of these states passes a ban is high, and especially in Nebraska, as Pillen is one of the nation’s largest pork producers and has railed against meat alternatives. While it won’t affect the cell-cultivated meat startups much in the short term, it would contribute to political hostility that could spell doom in the long run. —KT Metaculus aggregated forecast: 85 percent The evidence is adding up that the widespread legalization of gambling has been, at best, reckless. Putting a casino on the phones everyone carries around in their pocket has created social and economic harms that need to be taken seriously, before a deeper crisis sets in. It is a world that is unthinkable to me, as somebody who grew up in the shadow of the Pete Rose scandal. Whatever you think of Pete Rose the person, the all-time hits leader is not in the Baseball Hall of Fame because his gambling was regarded as a violation of the game’s most important values. Today, Major League Baseball airs on the FanDuel Sports Network in my area and the biggest name in sports media, ESPN, runs its own sportsbook. Only scandal could break the spell, right? But the truth is, we have already seen a series of sports betting scandals since the 2018 Supreme Court decision that unlocked this new era of gambling. NFL wide receiver Calvin Ridley lost a year of his young career to a gambling-related suspension. One NBA bench player was banned from the league for giving tips to gamblers and allegedly altering his play based on bets. But those players were not All-Stars, much less household names. We have not yet had a player of the caliber of LeBron James or Patrick Mahomes implicated by gambling allegations. But we have come close. Last year, National League MVP Shohei Ohtani of the MLB’s Los Angeles Dodgers was ensnared when his personal trainer faced criminal charges related to his gambling, though Ohtani was ultimately found not to be involved. It seems only a matter of time until a major sports star faces a serious gambling scandal. I don’t know if this will be the year. It may not be. But I’m confident the next Pete Rose is already out there. —DS Metaculus aggregated forecast: 15 percent Listen, the four-time world champ has grown on me a lot. Red Bull driver Max Verstappen has proven his dominance on the track over and over again, but with Lewis Hamilton (who has won seven times!) moving over to Scuderia Ferrari, I’m not so sure anymore. Plus, there’s McLaren’s Lando Norris, who had a hell of a car this previous season. I’m not a Lando enjoyer, but it’s undeniable that he’s inching closer and closer to being a challenger for the title. All that said, my prediction is that Max will win the drivers’ championship, but Red Bull will lose the constructors’ again. —Izzie Ramirez I’ve been a Charli stan since her Sucker and No. 1 Angel days, and it’s been absolutely wild watching her become a household name. Brat was as much a cultural phenomenon as it was the defining sound of the summer (and many political memes), with the album’s garish green becoming a shorthand for what’s cool. It appeared at the very top of year-end lists from publications like Metacritic and the New York Times — I’d be absolutely shocked if it didn’t win for album of the year. But I’m going to be intentionally open for this prediction: “360,” “Apple,” or the “Guess” remix featuring 2024 Future Perfect 50 honoree Billie Eilish are all also contenders in their respective song categories. Now if only the Academy could retroactively give Charli an award for her actual best song… —IR Clarification, January 2, 2025, 10:25 am ET: This story has been clarified to adjust the wording of two questions and the probabilities of the predictions to match those in Metaculus.

December 31, 2024 16:50 ET | Source: GraniteShares GraniteShares NEW YORK, Dec. 31, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GraniteShares has announced it will execute a reverse share split for one of its ETFs. The total market value of the shares outstanding will not be affected as a result of the transaction. Reverse split will be executed on GraniteShares 2x Short TSDD Daily ETF. After the close of the markets on January 10, 2025 (the “Payable Date”), the Fund will effect a reverse split of its issued and outstanding shares as follows: Please note the CUSIP change, effective January 13, 2025: As a result of the reverse split, every twenty shares of the Fund will be exchanged for one share of the Fund. Accordingly, the total number of the issued and outstanding shares for the Fund will decrease by the approximate percentage indicated above, while the per Share net asset value (“NAV”) and opening market price will be approximately twenty-times higher. Shares of the Fund will begin trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market (the “NASDAQ”) on a split-adjusted basis on January 13, 2025. The Fund’s total market value, and thus a shareholder’s investment value, will not be affected by the reverse split. The table below illustrates the effect of a hypothetical one-for-twenty reverse split anticipated for the Fund: 1-for-20 Reverse Split Redemption of Fractional Shares and Tax Consequences of the Reverse Split As a result of the reverse split, a shareholder of the Fund’s shares potentially could hold a fractional share. However, fractional shares cannot trade on the NASDAQ. Thus, the Fund will redeem for cash a shareholder’s fractional shares at the Fund’s split-adjusted NAV as of the Effective Date. Such redemption may have tax implications for those shareholders and a shareholder could recognize a gain or loss in connection with the redemption of the shareholder’s fractional shares. Otherwise, the reverse split will not result in a taxable transaction for holders of Fund shares. No transaction fee will be imposed on shareholders for such redemption. The GraniteShares ETF Trust’s transfer agent will notify the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) of the reverse split and instruct DTC to adjust each shareholder’s investment(s) accordingly. DTC is the registered owner of the Fund’s shares and maintains a record of the Fund’s record owners. All GraniteShares leveraged and inverse ETFs are intended only for investors with an in-depth understanding of the risks associated with seeking leveraged investment results, and who plan to actively monitor and manage their positions. There is no guarantee these ETFs will meet their objective. About GraniteShares GraniteShares is an independent ETF issuer headquartered in New York City. GraniteShares current ETF offering is presented below: Gregory FCA for GraniteSharesKathleen Elicker, 484-889-6597graniteshares@gregoryfca.com Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about the Funds, please call (844) 476 8747 or visit www.graniteshares.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. The investment program of the funds is speculative, entails substantial risks and include asset classes and investment techniques not employed by more traditional mutual funds. PRINCIPAL FUND RISKS (see the Prospectus for more information) GraniteShares Leveraged Long and Inverse Daily ETFs are not suitable for all investors. The funds seek daily leveraged investment results and are intended to be used as short-term trading vehicles. The funds pursue daily leveraged investment objectives, which means that the funds are riskier than alternatives that do not use leverage because the fund magnifies the performance of the underlying security. The volatility of the underlying security may affect the fund return as much as, or more than, the return of the underlying security. Investors who do not understand the Funds, or do not intend to actively manage their funds and monitor their investments, should not buy the Funds. The Funds are designed to be utilized only by traders and sophisticated investors who understand the potential consequences of seeking daily inverse and/or leveraged investment results, understand the risks associated with the use of leverage and/or short sales and are willing to monitor their portfolios frequently. For periods longer than a single day, the Funds will lose money if the underlying stock’s performance is flat, and it is possible that the Funds will lose money even if the underlying stock’s performance increases over a period longer than a single day. An investor could lose the full principal value of his/her investment within a single day. The Funds track the price of a single stock rather than an index, eliminating the benefits of diversification that most mutual funds and exchange-traded funds offer. Although the Funds will be listed and traded on an exchange, an investment in a Fund may not be suitable for every investor. The Funds pose risks that are unique and complex.

Title: Morris Chang and the Origins of TSMC

Time Published: 2024-12-31T14:58:55Z
Full Content:
If you were making a list of the most important companies in the world, you’d find Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, somewhere very close to the top. It’s one of a tiny handful of companies, along with Intel and Samsung, that can make the most advanced microchips, and it has a commanding lead in that market. TSMC makes the microprocessors and 5G chips for Apple’s iPhones and Macbooks. It makes chips for both Intel and AMD. And it makes the chips for Nvidia, Meta, and Amazon that are powering the AI boom. TSMC is so important that it’s sometimes called Taiwan’s “silicon shield”, the idea being that fear of damaging TSMC might dissuade China from trying to invade Taiwan. TSMC has a fascinating origin story: it was founded in 1985 by Morris Chang, who, after working in the US for Texas Instruments for more than 20 years, was enticed to go to Taiwan and help develop their high-tech industries as head of Taiwan’s Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI). Shortly after Chang arrived, he created TSMC as an ITRI spinoff. Despite the fierce competitiveness of the semiconductor industry and the comparative technological backwardness of Taiwan, within a decade under Chang’s leadership TSMC was making a billion dollars a year, and it continued to grow from there, ultimately becoming the most advanced semiconductor manufacturer on the planet. Given the importance of TSMC, the story of Morris Chang and how he managed to create the company is of obvious interest. And that story has been told, by him, in a two-volume autobiography. The first volume, covering his birth up to his early years at Texas Instruments, was released in 1998. The second volume, which covers the rest of his life up to the present day, was released in November of this year. Unfortunately, both volumes have currently only been published in Chinese. And despite the fact that we live in a world of infinite, free machine translation, and that the founding of TSMC is among the most important events in modern history, nobody seems to have bothered to translate them into English. This is a situation I would describe as “extremely stupid”. So I bought both volumes from a Taiwanese bookstore, and translated them. I experimented with a few different translation methods, including Claude 3.5 Sonnet (the LLM I use day to day) and Otranslator (a sketchy Chinese GPT-4o-based translation service that I’ve used before for PDFs). But ultimately what gave the best results, and was also the simplest, was the built-in translation tools in Google Chrome. The translation isn’t great; there’s a lot of language clunkiness and awkward phrasing (though I find that even human translated Chinese often reads pretty awkwardly if it’s not done really well). The machine particularly struggled with translating names, especially English names. It would often translate an English name into a phonetically similar cluster of syllables, or simply a similar-sounding Chinese name. The name “Haggerty” for instance, is variously translated as Hegdi, Haig, Haigidi, Haggard, Hagdi, and Hagrid. But despite these issues, the books were surprisingly readable, and I found Chang’s story quite compelling. It’s an interesting, inside look at both the evolution of the semiconductor industry and the genesis of the ideas behind TSMC. Morris Chang (whose Chinese name is “Zhang Zhongmou”) was born in 1931 in Ningbo, China. His family seems middle class, or maybe upper middle class: Chang’s father works in finance for the local government, and then later for a bank in the city of Guangzhou. As a child Chang moves around a lot due to war: when the Sino-Japanese War breaks out in 1937, Guangzhou gets bombed, and Chang’s family moves to Hong Kong. When Japan attacks Pearl Harbor in 1941, Japan invades Hong Kong the same day, and after a year living in occupied Hong Kong Chang’s father takes the family across battle lines to Chongqing in Free China. A few years after the war ends, the family is forced to flee again back to Hong Kong as the Chinese Civil war worsens and Communist forces advance. By now, Chang is about to graduate high-school, and he’s not sure what he wants to do next. He hopes to be a writer, but his father convinces him that it’s hard to make a living as a writer, and suggests Chang pursue technology or engineering. At the time, Hong Kong has no good universities for science and technology, so Chang’s father encourages him to apply to college in the US. Chang’s uncle works as a professor for Northeastern University, and helps him apply to Harvard, where he’s accepted. In a freshman class of around 1100, Chang is the only Chinese student (Chang notes that in total there were only 14 minorities or foreign students in his class - 1 black, 1 japanese, 1 from Africa, 3 europeans, and 8 hispanic.) Chang thrives at Harvard, and at the end of his first year he's in the top 10% of his class. But while Chang ultimately hopes to go back to China in the future, his plans change when the Communists win the war, forcing the nationalists to flee to Taiwan. During his first year Chang was most interested in studying the humanities and literature, but now he thinks he needs to plan more for a future career. Chang still has no real interest in engineering, but (per his father) he thinks it will offer good career prospects, so he transfers to MIT to study mechanical engineering. He works hard, getting his bachelors in mechanical engineering in 1952, and a masters in 1953. Chang plans on continuing school to get a phD, as that’s what most Chinese students did at the time (apparently believing that it’s the only reliable way to have a stable career in the US.) Chang takes MIT’s phD entrance exam twice, and fails both times; MIT’s rules prevent him from taking it a third time. Dejected, and with his plans in shambles, Chang decides to look for work. He applies and gets offers from several places (he has a masters from MIT after all), and he narrows his options down to two: doing research at Ford Motor company, or helping to automate transistor manufacturing at a company called Sylvania. Ford seems like the obvious choice; it’s a huge, successful company that would offer Chang job security and the potential for career advancement, and Chang gets along great with his future supervisor. Sylvania seems chaotic, his future supervisor seems indifferent to him, and Chang has no idea what the heck a transistor is. He decides to take the Ford job. However, the Sylvania offer is $1 dollar a month higher than the Ford offer. Chang calls Ford and asks if they’ll match the offer. But the person he speaks to is rude and dismissive, refusing to negotiate at all, and Chang gets so angry that he decides to take the Sylvania offer instead. Chang starts work at Sylvania in 1955. At the time Sylvania is one of a handful of companies that have licensed AT&T’s technology and are manufacturing transistors. At Sylvania’s factory, transistors are manually assembled one transistor at a time (a good worker can make “dozens of transistors per hour”). Chang observes Sylvania’s manufacturing process; he doesn’t know much about transistors, but he knows that semiconductors are very sensitive to impurities and chemical changes, and suspects that workers are inadvertently damaging the transistors while welding them, greatly reducing yields. Chang develops a new welding method that doesn’t require so much heating of the transistor; yields improve, and soon every production line has adopted his new method. Chang throws himself into learning more about transistors and semiconductors. He begins studying William Shockley’s textbook about them, working through it one painstaking page at a time. He has a colleague who’s an expert on semiconductors, who spends every night drinking at a bar; Chang sits at the bar with him asking him questions about semiconductors, going home to study more, then going back to the bar if he has more questions. Chang’s automation project is quickly forgotten, and he gets promoted to head of the R&D department to help develop new transistor products. Over the next several years, his department develops several different transistors made from germanium (while today most transistors are silicon, germanium was the major transistor material until the 1960s.) Chang continues to study semiconductors, and begins to publish his own research papers about them in journals. But despite Chang’s efforts, Sylvania’s semiconductor division is doing poorly, due to (according to Chang) poor leadership. The division is led by sub-par people without any background in semiconductors, who can’t take advantage of all the technical talent they have. Chang realizes that Sylvania is falling behind, and when he’s forced to lay off some of his subordinates, Chang gets fed up. He quits and takes a job at Texas Instruments as an engineering supervisor, moving his family across the country from Boston to Dallas in 1958. When Chang arrives at Texas Instruments (TI), he’s immediately impressed. Almost everyone is young, less than 40, and everyone works very hard, 50 hours a week or more. Some employees work so much that they bring cots into the office to sleep. And while there’s an obvious chain of command, there’s few trappings of status or hierarchy: unlike at Sylvania, there are no special parking spaces for executives, executives and workers eat together in the cafeteria, and high-level managers and production-line workers converse freely. And while leadership at Sylvania had no real technical background in semiconductors, everyone at TI seems to be an expert on them. Chang’s first task at TI is to help resolve manufacturing issues with a transistor being made for IBM. IBM itself has a very hard time making this transistor, achieving around 5% yield (the fraction of transistors that are acceptable) on average. But when the process gets transferred to TI it doesn’t seem to work at all: engineers joke that the yields are “zero and stable”. Chang works obsessively to try to solve the problem, working from 8 in the morning until midnight day after day. He concludes that IBM’s process specs are no good, and makes changes to the process based on his knowledge of semiconductor theory and his production line experience at Sylvania. Gradually, yields start to climb, first hitting IBM’s performance and then surpassing it. Eventually yields are greater than 30%, a very high percentage at the time (today, 30% yields would be considered very low). Of the four transistors TI is making for IBM, only Chang’s line is exceeding IBM’s own yield rates. Chang soon gets promoted to R&D manager for germanium transistors. Over the next two years, Chang’s department grows to more than a dozen engineers. During this period Chang meets Jack Kilby, and learns of his plan to try to make an integrated circuit. Chang is skeptical—it's so hard to make even one transistor that surely manufacturing a device with many integrated ones will never be practical—but he nevertheless offers his expertise when Kilby asks him for advice. Eventually Chang is approached by a manager who tells him that he could eventually rise to the position of Vice President of R&D, but to do so he would need to get a phD, and that TI will pay for Chang to get one. Chang feels like he has no choice but to accept, even though he’s somewhat worried that he’ll be giving up opportunities by putting his career on pause while he’s in school. In 1961, Chang applies and is accepted into Stanford’s electrical engineering graduate program. He again works hard and graduates in 3 years, but when he returns to TI he finds that many of his former colleagues have advanced several rungs up the ladder, while he’s back in his old position. But Chang hopes that his new knowledge, and the fact that the people he worked with previously are now high in the company, bodes well for his future. Upon his return in 1964, Chang quickly gets assigned to help fix another germanium transistor manufacturing issue for IBM. He resolves it, and gets promoted to manager of the entire germanium transistor group. By now silicon transistors are starting to displace germanium ones, but the germanium department is still TI’s largest and most profitable division. As manager of an entire department, Chang has much more to worry about than the technical aspects of transistor manufacturing, and he resolves to learn all other aspects of the business—marketing, pricing, finance, strategy, accounting, and so on. Chang continues to excel and get promoted, first to head of the silicon transistor department in 1965, and then to the head of the integrated circuit department in 1966. When he arrives as head of TI’s integrated circuit department, the division is struggling. While demand is growing rapidly, there are numerous competitors which have driven down prices and profit margins. Chang devises several strategies to try to combat this. First, he takes advantage of TI’s advanced manufacturing capabilities to produce integrated circuits with more transistors on them (so-called “Medium Scale Integration”, or MSI). While TI’s current integrated circuits are standardized commodities that almost anyone can produce, few manufacturers can achieve MSI; if customers can be convinced of the value of MSI, the profits for TI will be much higher. Chang also works to raise integrated circuit yields, which at the time were less than 20%. He decides to start a new fab in Houston, very near the existing fab in Dallas. The new fab soon achieves yields of 40%, and in response to the competitive pressure the Dallas fab manages to raise their yields as well. While leading the integrated circuit division, Chang is introduced to learning curve theory by the Boston Consulting Group. The learning curve is the observation that production costs tend to fall by a constant percent every doubling of production volume. Chang quickly recognizes the power of this for semiconductor manufacturing: high market share and large production volumes will drive costs very low, creating a moat of efficiency that will be hard for competitors to overcome. With TI’s high yields, the company’s manufacturing costs are already lower than its competitors, so Chang decides to regularly reduce the price of integrated circuits to put the screws to the competition and try to capture market share. During this period, TI also starts setting up overseas factories, which leads to two other important developments for Chang. One is that Chang begins to visit Taiwan regularly after TI sets up a factory there. The other is that Chang observes that Asian semiconductor factories are able to achieve much better yields than American factories. In 1972, Chang gets promoted again, to head of the entire semiconductor division. But at this point he begins to struggle, and his relationship with his boss and TI’s leadership becomes strained. He fails with a project to develop 16 kilobyte RAM, and Chang’s bosses undermine him by setting up a parallel project, outside of Chang’s control, to copy a competitor’s 16k product. As head of a division in a rapidly growing industry one of Chang’s main tasks is hiring, but because TI is located in Texas, far from Silicon Valley, he has an increasingly difficult time attracting talent. This is made worse by the fact that Chang’s boss decides to build a new fab in Lubbock, Texas, essentially in the middle of nowhere. Chang refuses an order from his boss to preferentially allocate semiconductor production capacity to Texas Instrument products, instead opting to divide it fairly between internal and external customers. As tensions grow, TI’s leadership begins to publicly criticize Chang. Chang is also increasingly unhappy with the state of technical knowledge and decision making at TI. His immediate boss, Fred Bucy, has no semiconductor background, and the knowledge of the executive leadership is increasingly out of date (something they seem to be ignorant of). Chang tries to convince leadership to start buying manufacturing equipment from outside vendors, which is more advanced and can achieve higher yields than TI’s internally-designed equipment, but he’s unsuccessful. He also fails to convince them to increase R&D spending, which Chang views as a short-sighted decision to prioritize short-term profits over long-term competitiveness. Increasingly unhappy, in 1977 Chang asks for a transfer, and gets moved to head of TI’s consumer products division. But things don’t get better. Consumer products is a relatively recent initiative at TI to sell semiconductor-based products directly, rather than simply being a supplier to other companies, but the company soon finds that selling to consumers is a much different business than selling to businesses. When Chang takes over, TI has three product lines: simple consumer calculators, more advanced scientific calculators, and electronic watches. Only the scientific calculators are profitable, but they’re a very small source of revenue; the entire division is losing money. Chang isn’t able to do much to change this; he thinks the entire foray into consumer products is misguided. The only successful consumer product released during Chang’s leadership is the Speak and Spell in 1978: because it requires special speech synthesis chips that are difficult to design and fabricate, it can’t be easily copied by low-cost competitors like most of TI’s other products. But the profits from the Speak and Spell are relatively modest, and the overall trajectory of the division doesn’t change. In 1979, TI releases a personal computer for the home, the TI-99/4. Chang thinks this is a mistake, and he’s proved right: the TI-99/4 sells poorly, fewer than 20,000 units, and is described as “an embarrassing failure” (though its successor, the TI-99/4A, is much more successful). As head of the consumer products group, Chang is blamed for this failure, and in 1981 is moved to a new position, Director of Quality and Productivity, what Chang later describes as “being put out to pasture.” His bonus and level of seniority are reduced, and he thinks it’s only a matter of time before his stock options are taken away and he’s asked to retire. Though Chang has great loyalty to TI, he’s finally fed up, and he quits in 1983. Chang looks around for a new job, at one point considering a position as head of Kodak’s new digital photography department, but ultimately takes a job as president of General Instrument, an electronics manufacturer. He moves to New York City, into the 53rd floor of Trump Tower (Trump himself is his next door neighbor). But Chang isn’t any more successful at General Instrument than he was in his final years at Texas Instruments. His subordinates are indifferent or hostile to him, and he soon finds that his vision of his new role doesn’t line up with the CEO who hired him. Chang thinks he’s supposed to help build up General Instrument’s most successful existing businesses, but he gradually realizes that his boss wants him to acquire small companies, reorganize their operations, and then turn around and sell them, similar to a private equity firm. Within a year, Chang is asked to resign. During his short stint at General Instrument, Chang does have one notable experience. At one point he’s approached by an entrepreneur trying to raise $50 million to start a chip design company, but shortly afterwards the entrepreneur comes back and tells him that he doesn’t need the investment after all: instead of spending the money building a fab, he can simply outsource all his manufacturing to other semiconductor companies. (The entrepreneur is Gordon Campbell, who would go on to found Chips and Technologies, one of the first fabless semiconductor companies.) While Chang was struggling at Texas Instruments, on the other side of the world Taiwan was making plans to develop its high-tech industries, and become more than a source of “plastic toys and low-cost running shoes”. In 1973 Taiwan founded the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) to help develop its industrial and technological capabilities. Taiwan’s industrial policy playbook was largely based on what had worked in Japan and Korea, and ITRI was based on similar institutes that had been founded in those two countries. One of the technology-based industries ITRI aimed to develop was semiconductor manufacturing, and in 1976 Taiwan licensed an obsolete 7-micron semiconductor manufacturing process from RCA, who was exiting the business. Before long ITRI had built a full-scale semiconductor production line using the new technology. Realizing that they would need outside expertise if they wanted the new semiconductor industry to succeed, Taiwanese leadership had been gently courting Morris Chang since the 1970s. During his time at TI Chang was invited to visit ITRI, and he authored a report on how Taiwan could develop its electronics industry. When ITRI was looking for technology to license, they asked Chang if TI was interested; though Chang declined (TI didn’t license any of its technology at the time), he helped them with their acquisition process, and confirmed that RCA’s CMOS-based technology was a good buy. And Chang was actually asked to become head of ITRI in 1982, before he even left TI, but he was unable to come to a workable arrangement with his boss and declined. After Chang leaves General Instrument, he’s once again asked to become head of ITRI, and this time he agrees. The purpose of ITRI is to help develop Taiwan’s technical industries, but when Chang arrives he finds it far too focused on academic-style research, and much too disconnected from the needs of industry. He comes up with a three-point plan to change this. First, ITRI should change its funding model so that half of its funding comes from industry. This will ensure that ITRI is researching things that are actually useful for private industry, and not just what’s interesting to the researchers. Second, to help diffuse the technology it develops, ITRI should start to spin off companies, staffed by ITRI employees. And third, the worst-performing ITRI employees should be put on probation; at the time no ITRI employee had ever been fired, and there was no mechanism in place to even give a warning. Chang hopes this will improve employee motivation and performance. Chang’s reform program is almost a complete failure. His idea to get industry funding is rejected, and he’s only able to maintain his employee probation program for one year. He’s able to spin off several companies, but none of them seem like immediate, obvious successes. Chang once again finds himself at odds with an organization he’s tasked with leading. His colleagues dislike him because of various failures of etiquette (such as asking questions during presentations, something considered normal in America but rude in Taiwan), and ITRI employees are angry at the threats to their job security the company spinoffs and probation policies represent. Eventually, Chang’s supporters in Taiwan’s government move on or retire; overwhelmed by opposition, Chang decides to leave ITRI in 1988. During his tenure at ITRI, Chang notes that he only managed to accomplish one big thing, something which occupies almost half his time while he’s there: founding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. On his second day at ITRI, Chang gets his predecessor’s to-do list. The first thing on the list is to deal with requests from three different integrated circuit companies to build semiconductor fabs. The requests have put ITRI in a bind: funding the construction of three separate fabs will cost more than $100 million, an enormous amount of money for ITRI to spend. On the other hand, ITRI’s whole reason for existence is to help develop industrial technology, and ITRI has spent years trying to develop its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities. How can they now turn around and reject requests that will help expand it? Leadership feels stuck, but Chang sees a way forward. At the time, most semiconductor manufacturers both designed chips and manufactured them. A company might rent out its extra fab capacity if it happens to have some, but it's hard for other companies to rely on this. Using another company’s fabrication capacity typically requires very close relationships with it; it's not the sort of thing that someone can just walk in off the street and buy. And when using another company’s capacity, someone who might be a competitor, there’s always the risk that they’ll appropriate your chip designs, or prioritize their own production over yours. Indeed, Texas Instruments had been sued by companies arguing that TI had unfairly prioritized manufacturing chips for its own internal use; TI had only prevailed in that lawsuit because Chang disobeyed his boss and refused to do this. So Chang knows that it’s hard to simply “buy” someone’s else's fab capacity. But he also knows that it’s getting harder and harder to build your own fabs; the cost of them keeps going up and up. Because of his knowledge of the learning curve, Chang also knows that it's very important for fabs to have as large an output as possible to achieve low production costs, and that current Taiwanese fabs are much too small. Chang has already seen entrepreneurs trying to start semiconductor companies that won’t have fabs at all, and will simply rent the capacity they need. And he remembers the very high profit margins Texas Instruments achieved when it manufactured custom-designed products for other customers rather than standardized ones. He’s also seen what can be achieved by a fab using vendor-supplied manufacturing equipment; building a fab no longer means having to build all the manufacturing equipment yourself. ITRI doesn’t have much in the way of semiconductor manufacturing capability. Thanks to licensing RCA’s technology, it’s built a real integrated circuit manufacturing line, but the technology was outdated when it was licensed, and while ITRI has pushed it forward (going from 7 microns to 5 microns to 4.5 microns), the rest of the industry has advanced faster, and ITRI only fallen further behind the cutting edge. It has no ability to design or market its own chips. ITRI’s only real advantage is that it has managed to achieve very high process yields, something Chang has repeatedly seen with southeast asian semiconductor fabs. Based on all these factors, Chang proposes that instead of building a separate fab for each firm requesting one, ITRI should build a single “common fab” to be used by all three. This operation will be a corporate spin-off from ITRI, staffed by existing ITRI personnel. And it won’t just make chips for these three companies: the new company will offer “foundry” semiconductor fabrication services; anyone who wants to have a chip built by them can. It won’t do any design work, or compete with any of its customers in any way. All the chips it makes will be designed by others. Chang hopes that this new business can eventually operate at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology, but as conceived its essentially a customer service play: its “product” will be reliable contract semiconductor fabrication services that right now don’t exist. Customers can get their chips fabricated without needing to develop special relationships, or worrying that they might get booted to the back of the line. It won’t offer cutting-edge technology, but not all chips need the latest and greatest process node. Chang thinks that with the rising cost of building a semiconductor fab, such services will only get more attractive, and that reliable contract manufacturing will allow for the creation of many more “fabless” companies that don’t have their own fabs at all. Chang’s plan faces opposition, but he eventually convinces Taiwan’s leadership that funding this new venture, to be called Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC, is worthwhile. However, there’s no way to fund such a venture without private investors contributing, and private investors won’t contribute if the project looks too risky. To create confidence in the project, Chang needs to find an existing semiconductor manufacturer to partner with, who will contribute a significant portion of the funding. Chang asks all the major semiconductor manufacturers, including Intel, Texas Instruments, Motorola, AMD, Panasonic, and Sony if they want to invest. Though everyone knows and respects Chang, they all turn him down. The only company that’s interested is Phillips, a second-rate semiconductor manufacturer from the Netherlands. Phillips agrees not because the idea of TSMC seems especially compelling, but because they want to take advantage of Taiwan’s low-cost labor and expand their factory operations there, and investing in TSMC seems like a good way to win favor with Taiwan’s government. Ultimately Phillips invests $40 million in the new venture, private investors contribute $35 million, and the government invests $70 million.1 To run the company, Chang needs someone with close connections to the European and American semiconductor industries. While TSMC’s early customers will be Taiwanese, Chang knows that long term it will only be successful if it can sell to the larger American and European markets. Chang thinks he himself is best suited for this, but because he’s running ITRI Chang instead hires Jim Dykes, the former director of GE’s semiconductor business, which GE is closing down. Dykes joins in early 1987, shortly after TSMC’s first factory (a repurposed production line in an ITRI building) comes online. As expected, TSMC’s first customers are Taiwanese semiconductor companies, but in late 1987 the company gets an unexpected visit from Intel. Intel wants to use TSMC to produce some of Intel’s older, less advanced products so it can free up capacity to produce more leading edge chips. Intel first gives TSMC a trial run to see if TSMC’s yields will meet Intel’s requirements; when they do, Intel becomes TSMC’s first American customer, but not before requiring TSMC to establish a rigorous production control system, including quality control, preventative maintenance, and statistical process control. Landing Intel as a customer sends a strong signal of TSMC’s competence, and Intel is soon followed by many other major semiconductor manufacturers wanting to outsource portions of their production: Motorola, Texas Instruments, Phillips, and so on. In some cases, not only are TSMC’s costs lower than the company doing the outsourcing, but its yields are higher. By 1988, TSMC is cash-flow positive, and (after Chang successfully navigates board opposition) the company breaks ground on its second factory. This factory is what really begins to drive TSMC’s success: while the first factory was a repurposed ITRI building, the second factory is a new, greenfield development. Not only will it operate at a much larger scale (30,000 wafers a month vs 13,000 in the first factory), lowering per-unit production costs, but it marks the beginning of TSMC’s efforts to push its manufacturing technology forward. The new factory is the first semiconductor factory in the world to adopt the SMIF (Standard Mechanical Interface) wafer-carrying pod The predecessor to today’s FOUPs, SMIFs act as micro-cleanrooms for wafers, reducing their exposure to environmental contaminants and decreasing defects. TSMC also takes a risk with its lithography machines, the beating heart of a semiconductor fab; while most semiconductor manufacturers use machines from Nikon or Canon, TSMC opts for higher-performing, but relatively untested machines from a new company called ASML (in part this is because ASML was spun off from Philips, TSMC’s major investor.) (At some point during these events, Chang takes over as head of TSMC, but the book is weirdly silent on the specifics of that transition. Chang talks about Dykes’ successors but not what happens after he himself leaves ITRI.) TSMC’s bets pay off, and the company grows rapidly; over a period of 10 years its revenues grow at an average rate of 49% annually, and by 1995 it has surpassed $1 billion in revenue. By 2000, TSMC is operating five factories, and producing more than 3 million wafers a year. And while much of its production is for other large semiconductor manufacturers like Intel, Chang’s prediction about the rise of “fabless” semiconductor manufacturers is born out. By 2000 60% of TSMC’s revenues are from fabless companies like Qualcomm, Broadcom, and Nvidia. The first volume of the autobiography covers from Chang’s birth in 1931 to around 1964. The periods described above, covering most of Chang’s career at Texas Instruments and his tenure at TSMC up to around 2000, make up around half of volume two. Unfortunately, I found the remainder of volume two surprisingly uninteresting. It consists mostly of discussion of high-level corporate operations: mergers, joint ventures, ownership agreements (there’s a lot on Chang dealing with Philips’ option to buy out TSMC), Chang’s thoughts on boards of directors and investment bankers, and so on. Conversely, there’s very little on what I was most interested in: the nuts and bolts on how TSMC continued to push manufacturing technology forward, adopting EUV, and so on. There’s a few interesting bits (such as how the deal for TSMC to make chips for the iPhone came about, or Chang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang resolving a business dispute over a pizza dinner), but they’re the exception. What strikes me most about reading Chang’s story is that, despite his immense talent, how often he ends up failing (or at least ends up in situations where he can’t succeed). Much has been made about how foolish Texas Instruments was to pass over Chang, and how if they hadn’t maybe TSMC could have been founded in America, but the reality is more complex and more interesting. Chang not only gets passed over for leadership at Texas Instruments (due to his perceived failures in the consumer products group and his ongoing tensions with executive leadership), but he fails at his next two jobs as well. He’s asked to leave by the CEO of General Instruments, and he’s effectively forced to resign as the head of ITRI after mostly failing to reform it and angering everyone in the process. After he leaves ITRI (his third resignation in five years) Chang wonders if, per the Peter principle, he’s risen to the level of his incompetence. And it seems like his one big accomplishment at ITRI, founding TSMC, wasn’t exactly a sure thing. Almost no existing semiconductor companies thought Chang’s plan was worth funding; the one that does, Philips, is more interested in currying favor with the Taiwanese government than it is with the merits of the business. It’s very easy to imagine TSMC not getting off the ground at all if things go slightly differently. Chang’s immense success with TSMC looks obvious only in hindsight; nobody at the time, including the Taiwanese government, other semiconductor manufacturers, and Chang himself, saw it that way. Footnote: TSMC also gets another $57 million in the form of a loan, from (presumably) the government. Probably already known but I believe that Emergent Ventures recently awarded a grant to translate Chang’s autobiography. Amazing story. This man fails at least three times and bounces back.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the sour final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. The major indexes posted big wins in 2024, a year that was marked by a continued surge in the artificial intelligence trade — led by the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — even as the bull rally broadened across the board. The single biggest winner in the S&P was Palantir (PLTR), with a nearly 350% gain for the year, while the biggest loser was Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which gave up 64% of its value. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate cut in four years, and President-elect Donald Trump's impending return to the White House drove stocks higher in the last two months. (Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 0.2%. The benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%.

Intel, the 56-year-old chipmaker co-founded by industry pioneers Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce and legendary investor Arthur Rock, had its worst year since going public in 1971, losing 61% of its value. The opposite story unfolded at Broadcom, the chip conglomerate run by CEO Hock Tan and headquartered in Palo Alto, California, about 15 miles from Intel's Santa Clara campus. Broadcom's stock price soared 111% in 2024 as of Monday's close, its best performance ever. The current company is the product of a 2015 acquisition by Avago, which went public in 2009. The driving force behind the diverging narratives was artificial intelligence. Broadcom rode the AI train, while Intel largely missed it. The changing fortunes of the two chipmakers underscores the fleeting nature of leadership in the tech industry and how a few key decisions can result in hundreds of billions — or even trillions — of dollars in market cap shifts. Broadcom develops custom chips for Google and other huge cloud companies. It also makes essential networking gear that large server clusters need to tie thousands of AI chips together. Within AI, Broadcom has largely been overshadowed by Nvidia, whose graphics processing units, or GPUs, power most of the large language models being developed at OpenAI, Microsoft, Google and Amazon and also enable the heftiest AI workloads. Despite having a lower profile, Broadcom's accelerator chips, which the company calls XPUs, have become a key piece of the AI ecosystem. "Why it's really shooting up is because they're talking about AI, AI, AI, AI," Eric Ross, chief investment strategist at Cascend, told CNBC's "Squawk Box" earlier this month. Intel, which for decades was the dominant U.S. chipmaker, has been mostly shut out of AI. Its server chips lag far behind Nvidia's, and the company has also lost market share to longtime rival Advanced Micro Devices while spending heavily on new factories. Intel's board ousted Pat Gelsinger from the CEO role on Dec. 1, after a tumultuous four-year tenure. "I think someone more innovative might have seen the AI wave coming," Paul Argenti, professor of management at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said in an interview on "Squawk Box" after the announcement. An Intel spokesperson declined to comment. Broadcom is now worth about $1.1 trillion and is the eighth U.S. tech company to cross the trillion-dollar mark. It's the second most valuable chip company, behind Nvidia, which has driven the AI boom to a $3.4 trillion valuation, trailing only Apple among all public companies. Nvidia's stock price soared 178% this year, but actually did better in 2023, when it gained 239%. Until four years ago, Intel was the world's most valuable chipmaker, nearing a $300 billion market cap in early 2020. The company is now worth about $85 billion, just got booted off the Dow Jones Industrial Average — replaced by Nvidia — and has been in talks to sell off core parts of its business. Intel now ranks 15th in market cap among semiconductor companies globally. Following the Avago-Broadcom merger in 2015, the combined company's biggest business was chips for TV set-top boxes and broadband routers. Broadcom still makes Wi-Fi chips used in laptops as well as the iPhone and other smartphones. After a failed bid to buy mobile chip giant Qualcomm in 2018, Broadcom turned its attention to software companies. The capstone of its spending spree came in 2022 with the announced acquisition of server virtualization software vendor VMware for $61 billion. Software accounted for 41% of Broadcom's $14 billion in revenue in the most recent quarter, thanks in part to VMware. What's exciting Wall Street is Broadcom's role working with cloud providers to build custom chips for AI. The company's XPUs are generally simpler and less expensive to operate than Nvidia's GPUs, and they're designed to run specific AI programs efficiently. Cloud vendors and other large internet companies are spending billions of dollars a year on Nvidia's GPUs so they can build their own models and run AI workloads for customers. Broadcom's success with custom chips is setting up an AI spending showdown with Nvidia, as hyperscale cloud companies look to differentiate their products and services from their rivals. Broadcom's chips aren't for everyone, as only a handful of companies can afford to design and build their own custom processors. "You have to be a Google, you have to be a Meta, you have to be a Microsoft or an Oracle to be able to use those chips," Piper Sandler analyst Harsh Kumar told CNBC's "Squawk on the Street" on Dec. 13, a day after Broadcom's earnings. "These chips are not meant for everybody." While 2024 has been a breakout year for Broadcom — AI revenue increased 220% — the month of December has put it in record territory. The stock is up 45% for the month as of Monday's close, 16 percentage points better than its prior best month. On the company's earnings call on Dec. 12, Tan told investors that Broadcom had doubled shipments of its XPUs to its three hyperscale providers. The most well known of the bunch is Google, which counts on the technology for its Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, used to train Apple's AI software released this year. The other two customers, according to analysts, are TikTok parent ByteDance and Meta. Tan said that within about two years, companies could spend between $60 billion and $90 billion on XPUs. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric," Tan said of the three hyperscale customers. In addition to AI chips, AI server clusters need powerful networking parts to train the most advanced models. Networking chips for AI accounted for 76% of Broadcom's $4.5 billion of networking sales in the fourth quarter. Broadcom said that, in total, about 40% of its $30.1 billion in 2024 semiconductor sales were related to AI, and that AI revenue would increase 65% in the first quarter to $3.8 billion. "The degree of success amongst the hyperscalers in their initiatives here is clearly an area up for debate," Cantor analyst C.J. Muse, who recommends buying Broadcom shares, wrote in a report on Dec. 18. "But any way you slice it, the focus here will continue to be a meaningful boon for those levered to custom silicon." Prior to 2024, Intel's worst year on the market was 1974, when the stock sank 57%. The seeds for the company's latest stumbles were planted years ago, as Intel missed out on mobile chips to Qualcomm, ARM and Apple. Rival AMD started taking market share in the critical PC and server CPU markets thanks to its productive manufacturing relationship with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Intel's manufacturing process has been a notch behind for years, leading to slower and less power-efficient central processing units, or CPUs. But Intel's most costly whiff is in AI — and it's a big reason Gelsinger was removed. Nvidia's GPUs, originally created for video games, have become the critical hardware in the development of power-hungry AI models. Intel's CPU, formerly the most important and expensive part in a server, has become an afterthought in an AI server. The GPUs Nvidia will ship in 2025 don't even need an Intel CPU — many of them are paired to an Nvidia-designed ARM-based chip. As Nvidia has reported revenue growth of at least 94% for the past six quarters, Intel has been forced into downsizing mode. Sales have declined in nine of the past 11 periods. Intel announced in August that it was cutting 15,000 jobs, or about 15% of its workforce. "We are working to create a leaner, simpler, more agile Intel," board Chair Frank Yeary said in a Dec. 2 press release announcing Gelsinger's departure. A big problem for Intel is that it lacks a comprehensive AI strategy. It's touted the AI capabilities on its laptop chips to investors, and released an Nvidia competitor called Gaudi 3. But neither the company's AI PC initiative nor its Gaudi chips have gained much traction in the market. Intel's Gaudi 3 sales missed the company's own $500 million target for this year. Late next year, Intel will release a new AI chip that it codenamed Falcon Shores. It won't be built on Gaudi 3 architecture, and will instead be a GPU. "Is it going to be wonderful? No, but it is a good first step in getting the platform done," Intel interim co-CEO Michelle Holthaus said at a financial conference held by Barclays on Dec. 12. Holthaus and fellow interim co-CEO David Zinsner have vowed to focus on Intel's products, leaving the fate of Intel's costly foundry division unclear. Before he left, Gelsinger championed a strategy that involved Intel both finding its footing in the semiconductor market and manufacturing chips to compete with TSMC. In June, at a conference in Taipei, Gelsinger told CNBC that when its factories get up and running, Intel wanted to build "everybody's AI chips," and give companies such as Nvidia and Broadcom an alternative to TSMC. Intel said in September that it plans to turn its foundry business into an independent unit with its own board and the potential to raise outside capital. But for now, Intel's primary client is Intel. The company said it didn't expect meaningful sales from external customers until 2027. At the Barclays event this month, Zinsner said the separate board for the foundry business is "getting stood up today." More broadly, he indicated that the company is looking to remove complexity and associated costs wherever possible. "We are going to constantly be scrutinizing where we're spending money, making sure that we're getting the appropriate return," Zinsner said.

Title: MicroStrategy's Dismal December Still Keeps It at Top of 2024 Bitcoin-Tied Asset Rankings

Disclaimer: The analyst who wrote this piece owns shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR)It's been a tough month for MicroStrategy (MSTR), the software developer turned bitcoin (BTC) accumulator. Its stock has tumbled almost 50% since November, when it joined the Nasdaq 100 index and peaked at a 600% gain since the start of the year. That still leaves the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based company a whopping 342% ahead in 2024, the biggest return among the highest-profile crypto-linked assets in traditional finance (TradFi). It's been a volatile year, packed with geopolitical and technological developments to rattle financial markets. The continuing wars in eastern Europe and the Middle East, elections across the globe, the unwinding of the yen carry trade in August and the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) have all left their marks. MicroStrategy's gain is almost double that of Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker whose production of integrated circuits needed for AI applications fueled a 185% return, the best among the so-called magnificent seven tech stocks. The next best, Meta Platforms (META), turned in 71%. Bitcoin itself rose 100% in a year that included April's reward halving and multiple record highs. Demand for the largest cryptocurrency was driven by the January approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the U.S. Bitcoin outperformed two of its biggest competitors, ether (ETH), up 42%, and Solana (SOL), up 79%. Among the ETF's iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) also returned over 100% and became the fastest ETF in history to hit $50 billion in assets. Bitcoin mining companies, on the whole, disappointed. Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI), a proxy for mining stocks, rose just under 30%. That's despite demand for the miners' computing capabilities and power supply agreements from artificial intelligence and high-performance computing (HPC) companies. Still, individual companies benefited, in particular, Bitdeer (BTDR),which added 151%, and WULF (WULF), which gained 131%. Nevertheless, the miners' gains beat the broader equities market. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index (NDX) added 28% while the S&P 500 Index (SPX) rose 25%. The S&P 500 also trailed behind gold's 27% increase. The precious commodity has now topped the equity gauge in three of the past five years. Concerns about U.S. inflation and the country's budget deficit added to the geopolitical uncertainties to prompt a massive rise in U.S. treasury yields, which move in the opposite direction to price. The yield on the 10-Year Treasury added 15% to 4.5% over the course of the year, and surprisingly gained a full 100 basis points since the Federal Reserve started cutting interest rates in September. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT), which tracks bond prices, dropped 10% this year and has lost 40% in the past five years. The dollar, on the other hand, showed its strength. The DXY Index (DXY), a measure of the greenback against a basket of the currencies of the U.S.' biggest trading partners, rose to the highest since September 2022. West Texas Intermediate (USOIL), the benchmark oil price in the U.S., ends the year little changed, up less than 1% to around $71 a barrel. But it was a bumpy ride, with the price rising to almost $90 at some points in the past 12 months. As we head into the new year, all eyes will be on the debt ceiling discussion, the policies of President-elect Donald Trump and whether the U.S. can continue with its impressive growth story.

Print Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.9% to 8,159.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% to 20,059.95, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% to 3,383.86 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. China's Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. Trading is set to resume in Tokyo on January 6, as markets will stay closed for the rest of the week for the New Year holidays. South Korean markets will be closed for New Year's Day and resume trading Thursday. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $71.61 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 59 cents to $74.58 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.22 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen. The euro cost $1.0409, little changed from $1.0410.

Title: Here’s Why Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) Is One of the Best Performing Dividend ETFs in 2024

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Performing Dividend ETFs In 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index Fund ETF Shares (VYM) stands against the other dividend ETFs. By the end of 2023, the global ETF market had reached $11.1 trillion in assets under management (AUM) and expanded to include 9,149 funds. This growth was driven by several milestones and the diversification of ETF offerings, which now cover equity, fixed income, active management, and alternative strategies. Despite unpredictable factors such as the rise of AI or policy changes, ETFs continue to be a vital investment tool. According to State Street Global Advisors, although only 45% of individual investors in the US use ETFs, nearly 70% of financial advisors and 67% of institutional investors recommend or use them frequently. However, ETFs still make up only 11.25% of the total global investable assets, suggesting there is significant potential for further growth. Interest in ETFs is rising, particularly among retail investors, with 63% of US investors planning to purchase ETFs in 2024, a sharp increase from 37% during 2022. Active ETFs are experiencing considerable growth, with global inflows hitting a record $166 billion in 2023 and continuing to rise in 2024. Much of this growth is driven by fixed income and alternative investments, while AI-related ETFs, especially in robotics and semiconductors, are attracting large amounts of investment. These trends reflect the growing demand for ETFs as investors seek more flexible and efficient ways to respond to market changes. A Reuters report from October 2024 highlighted that US ETFs focused on dividend-paying stocks have experienced a significant increase in inflows since the Federal Reserve began its rate-cutting cycle the prior month. In September, 135 US dividend ETFs tracked by Morningstar saw $3.05 billion in inflows, far higher than the average $424 million per month in the first eight months of 2024. However, this trend may slow as US Treasury yields have risen recently, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting a two-month high following strong employment data that suggests the economy is resilient and may not need further large rate cuts. Dividend ETFs tend to offer stable payouts and potential for growth, addressing challenges regarding unpredictable yields and limited principal growth. However, high-dividend ETFs vary in stability. Some high yields come from struggling companies with weak fundamentals. Riskier ETFs focus on stocks with declining conditions, leading to volatility and potential dividend cuts. Hence, investors should prefer dividend ETFs that manage exposure to unstable companies. Our Methodology We curated our list of the best dividend ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites. We have mentioned the year-to-date (YTD) share price performance of each ETF as of December 30, 2024, ranking the list in ascending order of the share price performance. We have also discussed the top holdings of the ETFs to offer better insight to potential investors. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stock indexes closed mostly lower Tuesday as the market delivered a downbeat finish on the final day of another milestone-shattering year on Wall Street. The S&P 500 gave up an early gain to finish down 0.4%. The benchmark index, which set 57 record highs in 2024, racked up a 23.3% gain for the year. This was its second straight year with a gain of more than 20%. The last time the index had as big a back-to-back annual gain was 1998. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%, and the Nasdaq composite lost 0.9%. Big Tech stocks led this year’s rally, pushing the Nasdaq to a yearly gain of 28.6%. The Dow, which is far less weighted with tech, rose 12.9% for the year. The stock market's record-breaking turn in 2024 was “certainly much better that what most people on Wall Street, myself included, thought we would get this year,” said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA. U.S. markets’ stellar run was driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Skyrocketing prices for companies in the artificial-intelligence business, such as Nvidia and Super Micro Computer, helped lift the market to new heights. Solid corporate earnings growth also helped. Wall Street expects companies in the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Another boost for the market: The economy avoided a recession that many on Wall Street worried was inevitable after the Federal Reserve hiked its main interest rate to a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy to beat high inflation. Receding inflation, which has gotten closer to the Fed’s 2% target, helped energize Wall Street, raising hopes that the central bank would deliver multiple interest rate cuts into next year, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. Still, after three interest rate cuts in 2024, the Fed has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 with inflation remaining sticky as the country prepares for President-elect Donald Trump to transition into the White House. Trump’s threats to hike tariffs on imported goods have raised anxiety that inflation could be reignited as companies pass along the higher costs from tariffs. This year’s market rally went beyond stocks. Bitcoin, which was below $17,000 just two years ago, climbed above $100,000 for the first time. And gold also shattered records on its way to a 27.4% gain for the year. Only about 38% of the stocks in the S&P 500 fell Tuesday, but a slide in technology stocks outweighed gains elsewhere in the market. Semiconductor giant Nvidia, whose enormous valuation gives it an outsize influence on indexes, fell 2.3%. Apple dropped 0.7%, and Advanced Micro Devices gave up 1.3%. Gains in energy stocks helped temper some of the declines. Exxon Mobil rose 1.7% and Chevron gained 1.2%. VeriSign rose 0.9% after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed it had increased its stake in the internet domain registry services company. All told, the S&P 500 fell 25.31 points to 5,881.63 on Tuesday. The Dow lost 29.51 points to close at 42,544.22, and the Nasdaq slid 175.99 points to finish at 19,310.79. The market's mini post-Christmas slump doesn't bode well for a ‘Santa Claus’ rally, the term for when U.S. stock indexes get a boost in the last five trading days of a year, plus the first two in the new year. Such a rally correlates closely with positive returns in January and the upcoming year. Even so, missing out on the Santa Rally isn’t necessarily a negative omen. “Historically, a negative Santa Claus rally still resulted in an average gain of almost 6% in the subsequent year,” Stovall said. Bond yields were mixed. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.57% from 4.54% late Monday. The yield on the two-year Treasury held steady at 4.24%. Crude oil prices rose 1%. Indexes in Europe mostly rose. Asian markets ended mixed, with exchanges in Tokyo and Seoul closed for New Year holidays. Markets will be closed on Wednesday for the New Year’s Day holiday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. Meanwhile, the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will close their equity and options markets on Jan. 9 in observance of a National Day of Mourning for former President Jimmy Carter, continuing a long-held Wall Street tradition in mourning the nation’s leaders. The 39th U.S. president and global humanitarian died on Sunday at his home in Plains, Georgia. He was 100 years old. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: The Most Unhinged and Impressive Fandom Collabs of 2024

In the past decade or so geek culture has expanded into the mainstream with more inclusive ways to express your fandom love. Once only marketed through black t-shirts with logos slapped on them or collectible toys, merch has undergone a massive shift. In 2024, repping your fandom became even easier than ever before, thanks to collections inspired by sci-fi and fantasy worlds in nearly every conceivable fashion and lifestyle arena. Between all the bold casual cosplay, subtle streetwear, and even luxury makeup and perfume, there was constantly a collaboration in the wings waiting to go viral. That’s not even mentioning movie popcorn buckets which were also insane this yearâso much so they warranted their own post. This year also had some more daring moments with its mountains of fandom merch. Keep reading to see how things got way more experiential and experimental thanks to the stream of unhinged products and social media-driven events. View this post on Instagram There was a whole month of Nickelodeon celebrating SpongeBob SquarePants by doing “Krabby Patty Kollabs” at burger destinations nationwide, timed to the show’s 25th anniversary. But the Wendy’s version felt the most authentic to the show’s depiction of the type of burger you’d get in a fast food place under the sea, especially compared to the elevated foodie stunt versions (they were cool, but Mr. Krabs would never). Wendy’s brought back the square meat patty for the occasion, and that was genius; it hit double the nostalgia factor so I found myself ordering this one more often. Speaking of food, Deadpool & Wolverine did a pizza line (which is on brand for the merc with the mouth) with DiGiorno’s that had mixed results. It wasn’t the wildest of the Deadpool placements; there were also those Heinz ketchup and mustard bottles, and the bonkers bootylicious Xbox controllers. On the cuter side of things around Halloween, we got the Universal Monsters x Care Bears collection which mashed up the adorable bears with a spooky twist through classic bear plushes, Funkos, and makeup. The plushes are hard to find at their regular price points now, with third party sellers shilling them for questionable prices. I still covet the Creature From the Black Lagoon Bear. View this post on Instagram For Gen Z goths, Pottery Barn came out with a creepy cute Wednesday collectionÂ featuring a Nevermore dorm vibe. We were particularly tickled by the thought of the Thing shaped pillow, which sold out in a snap.Â While the above collection is very limited at this point, Dr. Martens still has some of its Wednesday capsule available online. Docs and The Addams family? The perfect match for any goth kid’s (and kids at heart) shoe collection. A post shared by Dr. Martens (@drmartensofficial) In the realm of beauty products, our favorite clever match came in the form of Rihanna’s Fenty x Arcane line inspired by the characters on the Netflix show. The very in-depth collection drew from the leads’ sense of style and power with a quality makeup capsule from our sci-fi dreams. View this post on Instagram Anime and fellow Netflix fave One Piece has been featured in a number of fun collections inspired by the Straw Hat Crew, but the most uniquely unhinged was the Casetify collab that turned tech accessory covers into the Devil Fruits from the show. Particularly fun were the Gum Gum fruit headphone cases. A post shared by CASETiFY Co-Lab (@casetify_colab) And for Cowboy Bebop fans, Logic dropped a collab with Crunchyroll featuring streetwear fits inspired by the looks of the anime’s characters and their signature iconography to make you feel like you fit into the world of the classic cartoon. While Deadpool & Wolverine dominated the shelves for the first half of the year, Wicked took over fall. There was an incredible range of pink and green at every price point, much of it seemingly aimed at Wicked fans who’ve been waiting 20 years for merch that goes beyond any online theater shop. Eighth grade me with the grey shirt that read “Defy Gravity” in the tiniest of green-printed letters would be shocked at how many Wicked things adult me got this year, and she’d also be very proud. Did I really need the Wicked x Con-Air hair rollers? Yes. Did I really drop an undisclosed amount of change for the Beis x Wicked luggage? Yes, I can use it for work travel. Do I stay up at night haunted by the fact that I was not able to get the Elphaba Stanley tumbler from Target? Yes, and I foolishly check at random hours for a re-stock because goodness knows the wicked’s lives are lonely.Â More Wicked merch is guaranteed to come thanks to 2025’s Wicked: For Goodâthough we’re all still waiting forÂ some sort of official meta “Holding Space for ‘Defying Gravity'” release. The end of the year has brought a few notable collabs that have left me intrigued at what 2025 will bring. Nosferatu came with the most absurd of all, including a vampire coffin bed that was more expensive than a limited edition Nosferatu coffin-coffin to be buried in. Plus, there’s also a Nosferatu fragrance collab with Heretic, for those who care to give off the scent of a ghost wandering through a flower-filled funeral parlor. View this post on Instagram Speaking of bats and the winter chill of the end of year holidays. Uno continues to release unhinged versions of the card game including a Batman: The Animated Series version with chaotic “Joker” cards for more card-slamming across the table. And Walton Goggins has pulled a Baby Billy Bible Bonkers with his own “Walton Goggins Goggle Glasses,” perfect for hitting the slopes despite the head-scratching reasons behind just why he came up with this, because the official commercial feels like performance art. (To be honest, we can’t wait for an official Fallout collab called “Walton Goggins Ghoul Goggle Glasses”). View this post on Instagram And Squid Game season two gets some deeply eyebrow raising collabs with McDonald’s in Australia. If fans buy an adult Squid Game Happy Meal they’ll get a shot at an exclusive McDonaldâs Squid Game Green Player Tracksuit or $100,000 if they can carve out their very own Dalgona candy and scan it into the MyMaccaâs App. Audiences stateside were a little baffled by the Domino’s Emergency pizza ad during their binges of the show because that’s some chilling late-stage capitalism tone deafness. There’s also official collabs with Puma with new track suits as well as shoes and a tech accessory drop through Casetify. At least with the former you can don gear that will identify your vote to end or continue the games if you were in it, but lets be realâwe’re all in the game.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Encode, the nonprofit organization that co-sponsored California’s ill-fated SB 1047 AI safety legislation, has requested permission to file an amicus brief in support of Elon Musk’s injunction to halt OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit company. In a proposed brief submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Friday afternoon, counsel for Encode said that OpenAI’s conversion to a for-profit would “undermine” the firm’s mission to “develop and deploy … transformative technology in a way that is safe and beneficial to the public.” “OpenAI and its CEO, Sam Altman, claim to be developing society-transforming technology, and those claims should be taken seriously,” the brief read. “If the world truly is at the cusp of a new age of artificial general intelligence (AGI), then the public has a profound interest in having that technology controlled by a public charity legally bound to prioritize safety and the public benefit rather than an organization focused on generating financial returns for a few privileged investors.” In a statement, Sneha Revanur, Encode’s founder and president, accused OpenAI of “internalizing the profits [of AI] but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,” and said that “[t]he courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.” Encode’s brief has garnered the support of Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneer in the AI field and 2024 Nobel Laureate, and Stuart Russell, a UC Berkeley computer science professor and director at the Center for Human-Compatible AI. “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused nonprofit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,” Hinton said in a press release. “It received numerous tax and other benefits from its nonprofit status. Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.” OpenAI was launched in 2015 as a nonprofit research lab. But as its experiments became increasingly capital-intensive, it created its current structure, taking on outside investments from VCs and companies, including Microsoft. Today, OpenAI has a hybrid structure: a for-profit side controlled by a nonprofit with a “capped profit” share for investors and employees. But in a blog post Friday morning, the company said it plans to begin transitioning its existing for-profit into a Delaware Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), with ordinary shares of stock and the OpenAI mission as its public benefit interest. OpenAI’s nonprofit will remain but will cede control in exchange for shares in the PBC. Musk, an early contributor to the original nonprofit entity, filed suit in November requesting an injunction to halt the proposed change, which has long been in the works. He accused OpenAI of abandoning its original philanthropic mission of making the fruits of its AI research available to all and of depriving rivals of capital — including his AI startup, xAI — through anticompetitive means. OpenAI has called Musk’s complaints “baseless” and simply a case of sour grapes. Facebook’s parent company and AI rival, Meta, is also supporting efforts to block OpenAI’s conversion. In December, Meta sent a letter to California attorney general Rob Bonta, arguing that allowing the shift would have “seismic implications for Silicon Valley.” Lawyers for Encode said that OpenAI’s plans to transfer control of its operations to a PBC would “convert an organization bound by law to ensure the safety of advanced AI into one bound by law to ‘balance’ its consideration of any public benefit against ‘the pecuniary interests of [its] stockholders.’” Encode’s counsel notes in the brief, for example, that OpenAI’s nonprofit has committed to stop competing with any “value-aligned, safety-conscious project” that comes close to building AGI before it does, but that OpenAI as a for-profit would have less (if any) incentive to do so. The brief also points out that the board for the nonprofit OpenAI will no longer be able to cancel investors’ equity if needed for safety once the company’s restructuring is completed. OpenAI continues to experience an outflow of high-level talent due in part to concerns that the company is prioritizing commercial products at the expense of safety. One former employee, Miles Brundage, a longtime policy researcher who left OpenAI in October, said in a series of posts on X that he worries about OpenAI’s nonprofit becoming a “side thing” that gives license to the PBC to operate as a “normal company” without addressing potentially problematic areas. “OpenAI’s touted fiduciary duty to humanity would evaporate, as Delaware law is clear that the directors of a PBC owe no duty to the public at all,” Encode’s brief continued. “The public interest would be harmed by a safety-focused, mission-constrained nonprofit relinquishing control over something so transformative at any price to a for-profit enterprise with no enforceable commitment to safety.” Encode, founded in July 2020 by Revanur, describes itself as a network of volunteers focused on ensuring voices of younger generations are heard in conversations about AI’s impacts. Encode has contributed to various pieces of AI state and federal legislation in addition to SB 1047, including the White House’s AI Bill of Rights and President Joe Biden’s executive order on AI.

US stocks declined on Monday as the tech sector's sell-off accelerated into year-end. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered some of the morning's losses, down about 300 points around midday after falling by more than 500 points shortly after the opening bell. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also erased some earlier losses. The Nasdaq 100 has extended its mid-December decline to nearly 5% amid a rise in bond yields, while the S&P 500 has dropped by about 3% over the same time period. Yields edged lower on Monday, with the 10-year Treasury yield down six basis points to 4.559%. However, the yield is up sharply since earlier in the month when it was hovering around 4.1%. According to Fairlead Strategies founder Katie Stockton, the recent weakness in the stock market has flashed a technical "sell" signal. "The SPX posted a modest gain during the shortened week, but out intermediate-term indicators logged 'sell signals nonetheless, including the weekly stochastic and MACD," Stockton said, referring to two momentum-based technical indicators. Stockton said the sell signals increase the probability of a stock market correction in January. A slide in Boeing shares weighed on the Dow on Monday, with the stock down as much as 6% after a Boeing 737-800 plane crashed in South Korea on Sunday, killing 179 people onboard. For economic data this week, investors will watch the release of the S&P Case-Shiller home price index on Tuesday morning, followed by initial jobless claims on Thursday and ISM manufacturing data on Friday.

Title: Why The 60/40 Portfolio Needs Bitcoin In Today’s Market

Metallic Bitcoin symbol with financial chart over dark background. Horizontal composition with ... [+] selective focus and copy space. If you happen to be a Bitcoin skeptic, you’re not alone. A recent Pew Research survey found that 63% of Americans are not confident in the reliability or safety of cryptocurrencies in general. But when BlackRock speaks, it often pays to listen. In its just-released 2025 Global Outlook report, the world’s largest asset management firm lays out a case for Bitcoin not only as a diversifier alongside gold but also a strategic hedge against an environment where the historical stock-bond correlation is breaking down. For decades, the classic 60/40 portfolio — 60% stocks, 40% bonds — was the gold standard of diversification. When stocks crashed, as they did during the dot-com bubble and global financial crisis, bonds usually rose in value, providing a cushion against market volatility. But we’re in a new regime now where this correlation has become increasingly unreliable. If you recall, 2022 was the worst year on record for U.S. stocks and bonds. BlackRock identifies this trend and suggests that investors need to look beyond government bonds for diversification. This is where gold and Bitcoin come into play. Both assets offer unique advantages as hedges and diversifiers, but they do so in different ways. Bitcoin’s potential as a portfolio diversifier stems from its unique value proposition. It has a fixed supply of 21 million coins, and its demand is influenced by adoption trends, investor sentiment and macroeconomic factors. In the days following the November election, Bitcoin surged above $100,000, with its market cap topping $2 trillion—just under 2% of the total value of global equities. Bitcoin's market cap approaches 2% of global equities Last Thursday, Bitcoin tumbled 3.6%, falling back below $100,000, on the news that the Federal Reserve will approve fewer interest rate cuts than the market expected next year. BlackRock isn’t suggesting that Bitcoin should replace bonds in your portfolio. Instead, they’re recommending a modest allocation—1% to 2%—to capture its diversification benefits without significantly increasing risk. In fact, a 2% Bitcoin allocation provides a similar risk profile to holding the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Tesla) in a balanced portfolio. Even though Bitcoin’s market cap has fallen below $2 trillion, it remains the seventh-largest asset in the world, ahead of Saudi Aramco and even silver. The global gold market, by comparison, is valued at $17.8 trillion—nine times larger than Bitcoin. But Bitcoin’s growth trajectory is undeniable. Before its price declined, it took 40 ounces of gold to buy one Bitcoin. That’s roughly double what it was at the beginning of the year. Bitcoin doubled its value relative to gold in 2024 Galaxy Digital’s Mike Novogratz believes Bitcoin could match and even surpass gold’s $17 trillion market cap within the next five to eight years. That’s a bold prediction, but it’s not without merit. As more investors, institutions and nations adopt Bitcoin, its scarcity becomes more pronounced, potentially driving prices higher. While Bitcoin has established itself as digital gold, Dogecoin has carved out a niche as a lighthearted, community-driven cryptocurrency with surprising staying power. Originally launched as a joke in 2013, Dogecoin has since grown into a legitimate digital asset with a market cap in the tens of billions. Dogecoin’s appeal lies in its utility for microtransactions. It’s used mostly to tip content creators and foster online engagement. Its low transaction fees and fast processing times make it an ideal currency for small, everyday payments. Unlike Bitcoin’s fixed supply, Dogecoin has no hard cap, which helps keep its price stable for transactional use. Elon Musk’s longtime support of Dogecoin has contributed to its growing popularity. News that President-elect Donald Trump plans to appoint Musk to co-lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has added to the speculation and excitement. Since the election, Dogecoin has significantly outperformed Bitcoin. Dogecoin has outperformed Bitcoin since the U.S. election While it’s still seen as a “meme coin,” Dogecoin’s growing user base and real-world utility suggest that it might deserve a closer look from investors. There’s even talk of a Dogecoin ETF next year. BlackRock’s research makes a compelling case for a 1% to 2% allocation to Bitcoin. I believe this relatively small position can provide meaningful diversification benefits without exposing your portfolio to excessive risk. And as Bitcoin’s market cap continues to grow, that modest allocation could deliver outsized returns. Remember, Bitcoin is still a volatile asset. But so was gold during the 1970s when it was reintroduced to the free market after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. I’ve been in this game for decades, and what I know is that over time, volatility tends to decline as an asset becomes more widely adopted. Gold will always have a place in my portfolio as the ultimate store of value. But it’s also important to stay open to new opportunities. Bitcoin represents a new frontier in wealth preservation and growth, and even the most conservative investors can no longer afford to ignore it. One Community. Many Voices.

Title: How the Benefits—and Harms—of AI Grew in 2024

Time Published: 2024-12-30T12:00:00Z

In 2024, both cutting-edge technology and the companies controlling it grew increasingly powerful, provoking euphoric wonderment and existential dread. Companies like Nvidia and Alphabet soared in value, fueled by expectations that artificial intelligence (AI) will become a cornerstone of modern life. While those grand visions are still far into the future, tech undeniably shaped markets, warfare, elections, climate, and daily life this year. Perhaps technology’s biggest impact this year was on the global economy. The so-called Magnificent Seven—the stocks of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla—thrived in large part because of the AI boom, propelling the S&P 500 to new highs. Nvidia, which designs the computer chips powering many AI systems, led the way, with its stock nearly tripling in price. These profits spurred an arms race in AI infrastructure, with companies constructing enormous factories and data centers—which in turn drew criticism from environmentalists about their energy consumption. Some market watchers also expressed concern about the increasing dependence of the global economy on a handful of companies, and the potential impacts if they prove unable to fulfill their massive promises. But as of early December, the value of these companies showed no sign of letting up. Though not with the explosive novelty of ChatGPT’s 2023 breakthrough, generative AI systems advanced over the past 12 months: Google’s DeepMind achieved silver-medal results at a prestigious math competition; Google’s NotebookLM impressed users with its ability to turn written notes into succinct podcasts; ChatGPT passed a Stanford-administered Turing test; Apple integrated new artificial intelligence tools into its newest iPhone. Beyond personal devices, AI played a pivotal role in forecasting hurricanes and powering growing fleets of driverless cars across China and San Francisco. A more dangerous side of AI, however, also came into view. AI tools, created by companies like Palantir and Clearview, proved central to the wars in Ukraine and Gaza in their ability to identify foreign troops and targets to bomb. AI was integrated into drones, surveillance systems, and cybersecurity. Generative AI also infiltrated 2024’s many elections. South Asian candidates flooded social media with AI-generated content. Russian state actors used deepfaked text, images, audio, and video to spread disinformation in the U.S. and amplify fears around immigration. After President-elect Donald Trump reposted an AI-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing him on the campaign trail, the pop star responded with an Instagram post about her “fears around AI” and an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris instead. Read More: How Tech Giants Turned Ukraine Into an AI War Lab Swift’s fears were shared by many of her young fans, who are coming of age in a generation that seems to be bearing the brunt of technology’s harms. This year, hand-wringing about the impact of social media on mental health came to a head with Jonathan Haidt’s best seller The Anxious Generation, which drew a direct link between smartphones and a rise in teen depression. (Some scientists have disputed this correlation.) Social media platforms scrambled to address the issue with their own fixes: Instagram, for instance, set new guardrails for teen users. But many parents, lawmakers, and regulators argued that these platforms weren’t doing enough on their own to protect children, and took action. New Mexico’s attorney general sued Snap Inc., accusing Snapchat of facilitating child sexual exploitation through its algorithm. Dozens of states moved forward with a lawsuit against Meta, accusing it of inducing young children and teenagers into addictive social media use. In July, the U.S. Senate passed the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA), which puts the onus on social media companies to prevent harm. Most tech companies are fighting the bill, which has yet to pass the House. The potential harms around generative AI and children are mostly still unknown. But in February, a teenager died by suicide after becoming obsessed with a Character.AI chatbot modeled after Game of Thrones character Daenerys Targaryen. (The company called the situation "tragic" and told the New York Times that it was adding safety features.) Regulators were also wary of the centralization that comes with tech, arguing that its concentration can lead to health crises, rampant misinformation, and vulnerable points of global failure. They point to the Crowdstrike outage—which grounded airplanes and shut down banks across the world—and the Ticketmaster breach, in which the data of over 500 million users was compromised. President Joe Biden signed a bill requiring its Chinese owner to sell TikTok or be banned in the U.S. French authorities arrested Telegram CEO Pavel Durov, accusing him of refusing to cooperate in their efforts to stop the spread of child porn, drugs, and money laundering on the platform. Antitrust actions also increased worldwide. In the U.S., Biden officials embarked on several aggressive lawsuits to break up Google’s and Apple’s empires. A U.K. watchdog accused Google of wielding anticompetitive practices to dominate the online ad market. India also proposed an antitrust law, drawing fierce rebukes from tech lobbyists. But the tech industry may face less pressure next year, thanks in part to the effort of the world’s richest man: Elon Musk, whose net worth ballooned by more than $100 billion over the past year. Musk weathered many battles on many frontiers. Tesla failed to deliver its long-awaited self-driving cars, agitating investors. X was briefly banned in Brazil after a judge accused the platform of allowing disinformation to flourish. In the U.S., watchdogs accused Musk of facilitating hate speech and disinformation on X, and of blatantly using a major public platform to put his finger on the scale for his preferred candidate, Donald Trump. Musk’s companies face at least 20 investigations, from all corners of government. Read More: How Elon Musk Became a Kingmaker But Musk scored victories by launching and catching a SpaceX rocket and implanting the first Neuralink chip into a paralyzed patient’s brain. And in the November election, his alliance with Trump paid off. Musk is now a prominent figure in Trump’s transition team, and tipped to head up a new government agency that aims to slash government spending by $2 trillion. And while the owner of Tesla must navigate Trump’s stated opposition to EVs, he is positioned to use his new perch to influence the future of AI. While Musk warns the public about AI’s existential risk, he is also racing to build a more powerful chatbot than ChatGPT, which was built by his rival Sam Altman. Altman’s OpenAI endured many criticisms over safety this year but nevertheless raised a massive $6.6 billion in October. Is the growing power of tech titans like Musk and Altman good for the world? In 2024, they spent much of their time furiously building while criticizing regulators for standing in their way. Their creations, as well as those of other tech gurus, provided plenty of evidence both of the good that can arise from their projects, and the overwhelming risks and harms.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 16.25% Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The firm has managed to position itself as one of the most important AI stocks in the industry after suffering devastating market performance in 2022 because of Mark Zuckerberg's focus on the metaverse. Now, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has shaped up as an important AI player because of its 3 billion+ user base which investors believe can be used to monetize AI and push services to consumers. The firm is already allowing advertisers to use AI tools to run campaigns, and its narrative depends on sustained AI monetization. Another major catalyst for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stock in H2 2024 has been a potential TikTok ban that could further grow its user base. Cramer was full of praise for the firm's AI division in August: "We're constantly being told that none of the big companies spending fortune in video chips for AI has seen any meaningful return on that investment. They're only doing it to prevent their competitors from getting an edge. That's what we keep on hearing. That's absurd! Memo to the clueless naysaying individuals: Have you seen what Meta Platforms has been doing with their computing power? They have, out of nowhere, become one of the most popular generative AI platforms with Meta AI. You have to try. I have switched to it. It is that good. Meta has been using their Nvidia purchases to make instagram reels much more relevant to you, much faster, cleaner. Meta has the best numbers of any of the tech titans. You think that's some sort of coincidence?" Overall META ranks 2nd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 193 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 08-12-24 Performance Since Then: 25.75% NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the world's leading AI GPU designer whose shares have gained more than 700% since OpenAI publicly unveiled ChatGPT. The firm commands the lion's share of the AI GPU market as it enjoys a large competitive advantage through the performance of its chips. Yet, since AI is a relatively nascent industry and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) doesn't enjoy a similar presence in other markets, its shares are dependent on AI's fate. The stock has struggled since July as investors wait to see NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s Blackwell products, supply chain strengths, and cost control. Here's what Cramer said in August: "Nvidia's Jensen Huang has been telling you can get 4x your money if you buy his chips. That's 4x return. I think Meta could end up getting that. The others, they actually have to spend to play catchup. It's not mythical, it's reality. How much money have you made over the years betting against Jensen Huang?" Overall NVDA ranks 3rd on our list of the AI stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
