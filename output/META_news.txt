Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025.

Title: Mark Zuckerberg takes the stand in historic antitrust trial that could force breakup of Meta

Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took to the witness stand on the first day of a historic antitrust trial to defend his company against allegations it illegally monopolized the social media market. The trial could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups Meta bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. WATCH: How Meta’s blockbuster antitrust trial could have major implications for big tech FTC attorney Daniel Matheson called Zuckerberg as the first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. At the trial, Matheson focused on a communication sent to colleagues that illustrated Zuckerberg’s frustration with a lack of progress on developing a photo-sharing app to compete with Instagram’s. “The way I read this message is that I’m not happy about how we’re executing on that project,” Zuckerberg said. Matheson followed up by asking if that was because of Instagram’s rapid growth. “That does seem to be what I’m highlighting,” Zuckerberg said, adding that he’s always urging his teams to do better. Later in the day, Zuckerberg appeared frustrated when Matheson asked him about his concerns expressed about how fast Instagram was growing. “I don’t have the full timeline of Instagram’s development in my head,” Zuckerberg said, when Matheson asked him about his mention of its growth. “You could probably get that better from somebody else.” Matheson also asked about comments of plans to keep Instagram running, while focusing on Facebook and not investing in Instagram. Zuckerberg said he wouldn’t characterize it as a plan, and he insisted that Instagram wasn’t neglected. “In practice, we ended up investing a ton in it after we acquired it,” Zuckerberg, who testified most of the afternoon, said. In opening statements, Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive. Support PBS News Hour now.

Title: How Are the ‘Magnificent 7’ Companies Faring Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

Time Published: 2025-04-15T13:38:39Z

To say it’s been two tumultuous weeks for the group of tech stocks dubbed the “Magnificent Seven” would be an understatement. Shares in Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META) and Nvidia have swung wildly in recent days as investors react to President Donald Trump’s volatile tariff announcements. Thank you for signing up! By clicking submit, you agree to our <a href="http://observermedia.com/terms">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties. You can opt out anytime. The Magnificent Seven fell sharply on April 2 after Trump unveiled his so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs, which enacted a blanket 10 percent levy and higher “reciprocal” tariffs for the U.S.’s largest trading partners. That same day, 25 percent levies on imported autos and auto parts also went into effect—causing a selloff across automobile stocks. Shortly after those reciprocal tariffs took effect, on April 9, the President announced that he would pause them for 90 days—except for China, whose tariffs were raised to 145 percent. Two days later, the administration said smartphones and a list of electronics manufactured in China would be exempt from the high tariffs. The chaos has understandably caused tech stocks to ricochet. While the Magnificent Seven companies are particularly vulnerable to tariffs since three-quarters of their suppliers are located abroad, some have more to lose than others. Apple, for example, relies on China for the bulk of its iPhone production, while Amazon’s e-commerce business sources heavily from overseas. Here’s a look at how the Magnificent Seven has fared in recent days: Apple’s hardware-centric business makes it especially vulnerable to trade barriers. The iPhone maker’s share price fell 23 percent in the days following April 2. Its shares rebounded on April 9 along with the broader market after Trump’s 90-day reprieve spared manufacturing hubs like India, which produces 15 percent of all iPhones, from high tariffs. Apple shares jumped again today (April 14) after most of its products were exempt from tariffs imposed on China, which currently produces around 90 percent of iPhones. Like the rest of the Magnificent Seven, Microsoft took a hit after Trump’s initial wave of global tariffs but regained ground following the president’s temporary pause. The software giant is less exposed to trade shocks than its tech peers, thanks to a business model that leans heavily on software products. The Microsoft division that produces hardware like Surface devices and Xbox consoles made up just 21 percent of revenue, according to its latest earnings report. That cushion has helped insulate Microsoft from the volatility hammering more hardware-heavy firms. Nvidia shares, which slid alongside the market after the initial tariff news, rebounded after Trump exempted certain computer components from China tariffs. But the rally may be short-lived, as the chipmaker faces tariffs on semiconductor imports, which Trump says are on the way. (Nvidia chips are primarily made in Taiwan.) In a bid to get ahead of such levies, Nvidia today announced plans today to pour up to $500 billion over the next four years into domestic A.I. chip production. Amazon’s shares have fallen by a total of 7 percent in the past dozen days. Trump’s tariffs, especially his levies on China, are expected to hit the e-commerce giant hard as up to 70 percent of goods sold on Amazon are sourced from China. But Amazon isn’t completely reliant on e-commerce—its cloud unit AWS accounts for around half the company’s profits and won’t be as impacted by the administration’s levies as Amazon’s physical goods business. Meta may not rely heavily on hardware like some of its tech rivals, but that didn’t spare its stock from a steep drop—down more than 13 percent in just two days after April 2. Shares bounced back with the rest of the Magnificent Seven after Trump’s 90-day reprieve, but the threat still looms. The company’s core business—selling digital ads, many of them from foreign brands—stands to take a hit if global tariffs squeeze international marketing budgets. Even without a direct hardware link, Meta is far from immune to the ripple effects. (Meta’s Quest VR headsets are manufactured in Taiwan.) Like Meta, the Google parent company’s revenue primarily comes from advertising and software services. Its share price has been less volatile than some of its Big Tech peers, down 7 percent after “Liberation Day” and rebounded 10 percent after the reprieve was announced. Tesla may build its cars in the U.S., but that wasn’t enough to shield the automaker from fallout. While the company dodged the administration’s 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles, it wasn’t as lucky with car parts—30 to 40 percent of which are sourced from abroad and now face added levies. Tesla (TSLA) shares have slid more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, dragged down not just by tariff concerns but also by growing public backlash to Elon Musk’s controversial role as head of the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Meanwhile, the company has suspended new orders for its American-made Model S and Model X vehicles in China, which currently has a 125 percent retaliatory tariff against U.S. goods.

Title: The future of IRS Direct File looks grim

Time Published: 2025-04-15T12:05:32Z

Hello! It's Tax Day in America. Wishing you all luck from afar — hopefully, you don't follow in my colleague Zak Jason's steps and forget to attach your W2. And today's big story is right on theme: We're taking a look at what's going on inside the IRS. What's on deck Markets: One crucial consequence of President Trump's trade war is being overlooked. Tech: Facebook isn't about connecting with friends anymore, Mark Zuckerberg said during day one of Meta's antitrust trial. Business: These automakers are picking up the slack from Tesla's slumping sales. But first, let's talk taxes. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. How are you filing your taxes this year? You might be using IRS Direct File, the nation's first free tax-filing system. But its future is looking grim: A senior Treasury official told BI it was a failed and disappointing program used by only a small fraction of the nation's taxpayers. Sam Corcos, a DOGE official and one of the group's public faces, has also said he thinks the relatively new program should be shut down, sources told BI. The uncertainty has disappointed people who believe Direct File is emblematic of the very things that DOGE is supposed to be building, BI's Juliana Kaplan and Jack Newsham write. It's meant as a tech solution to file taxes quickly and directly to the IRS, bypassing fees to for-profit software companies. However, critics of the tool say it's too costly and wasn't implemented legally. Tax season is a source of angst for many Americans. This year, some IRS employees who have returned to the office are in the same boat. Workers under the IRS's return-to-office mandate said they've operated out of conference rooms and cafeterias, battled spotty internet connections, and navigated boxes of paperwork scattered throughout the halls. IRS employees told BI that while RTO had come with certain upsides, like leaving work at the office, the return has been tumultuous and the opposite of efficient. "People are not happy, and it's going to affect productivity going forward," one employee said. 1. An overlooked byproduct of Trump's trade: the weakest dollar in years. Typically seen as a safe haven during market volatility, the US dollar index is sitting near a three-year low. This may reflect souring global sentiment toward the US following unpredictable tariffs. 2. Webull's stock is soaring. The digital investment platform's shares spiked as much as 500% to $79.56 on Monday. Webull went public via SPAC merger after combining with SK Growth Opportunities and delaying its IPO plans in 2021. 3. Asia's auto stocks surge. Major automakers like Toyota and Honda saw significant stock gains on Tuesday after Trump said he was considering a temporary exemption on imports. 1. Apple can't catch a break right now. On Friday, the iPhone maker appeared to be off the hook on tariffs until President Trump clarified on Sunday that tech products would be subject to separate levies in the future. But Apple's China problem goes beyond tariffs. 2. Trump's trade war is putting robots to work. The robots-as-a-service company Formic said its customers have increased their robot usage this year. It's likely these brands were using robots to save money ahead of tariff-related price increases. 3. Facebook isn't really for friends, Mark Zuckerberg said. In a landmark antitrust case, the FTC is arguing that Meta monopolizes apps that share content with friends and family. Zuckerberg testified Facebook's main purpose has evolved beyond connecting with friends. 1. The biggest winners from Tesla's sales slump. The carmaker's competitors are taking bigger bites of Tesla's market share while the overall EV market grows. In the US, GM and Ford are some of the big winners, while BMW and VW are soaring in Europe. 2. Starbucks baristas' new fit. Starting May 12, Starbucks store employees will be required to wear a solid-color black top to highlight the iconic green apron. The dress code is the latest change the coffee chain has made as it tries to boost sales. 3. Pay us or give us a TV show. A Trump ally suggested Warner Bros. Discovery could please the president by offering money, programming, or both. That says a lot about the relationship between the president and the media in 2025, Peter Kafka writes.

Title: 'I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help' - how tech bros are taking over the world
URL: https://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Im-from-the-technocracy-and-Im-here-to-help-how-tech-bros-are-taking-over-the-world
Time Published: 2025-04-15T07:18:00Z
Full Content:
Michael Kvakin - Fotolia When I first saw the photos of all of the tech broligarchy lined up behind Donald Trump on his inauguration day something struck me as off. I couldn't figure out what was bothering me until now. I realised they didn't just look like very powerful attendees, they looked much more like very powerful shareholders in government - and unelected ones at that. We can see today where that power translates directly into US government policymaking with the reductions on certain tech tariffs from China. Let's look at what that means for Apple alone. With 90% of iPhones manufactured in China, Apple faced potential price increases of up to $3,500 per phone under the proposed 145% tariff. In 2024, US imports of smartphones from China were valued at $41.7bn while laptops were valued at $33.1bn. The tariff exemption therefore translates into avoided costs of approximately $60bn annually for these two categories alone. And while Apple will have only a share of that benefit, it's a staggering return for Tim Cook's donation of $1m to Trump’s inaugural committee - which also marked Cook’s first time attending a presidential inauguration, despite his political views often differing from Trump’s policies. But it's not only tech’s influence in policymaking areas such as tariffs that directly affect their bottom line, we need to think about their broader reach in the realm of geopolitics. Where did the ideas of making Canada the 51st State, or annexing Greenland actually emerge from? If there was a policy vacuum here it was neatly filled by none other than Elon Musk drawing on the ideas of his maternal grandfather Joshua Norman Haldeman. Haldeman was a key proponent of the Technocracy movement which started in the early 1930s in the US and then spread to Canada. It proposed the creation of the Technate of America. This would do away with borders, merging the US, Canada, Mexico, Central America and Greenland into a single nation under a regime of engineers and technicians. Sounds familiar, right? Its essential argument was that there was no room for politics in society and that engineers and scientists were best placed to decide what was best for citizens in terms of organising resources and society. In 2019 Musk tweeted on X, “Accelerating Starship development to build the Martian Technocracy”. Except now it looks like he is not waiting to do it on Mars, he's doing it here in real time. The idea of the futility of the nation state and of politics in favour of new technological frontiers is echoed in The sovereign individual published in 1997. This book examined the social, economic and political implications of the coming technology on society and particularly politics and governments. Authors James Dale Davidson and William Rees-Mogg - father of Jacob Rees-Mogg - wrote, “Representative democracy as it is now known will fade away to be replaced by the new democracy of choice in the cybermarketplace. If our deductions are correct the politics of the next century will be much more varied and less important than that to which we have become accustomed. The 20th century nation-state will starve to death as its tax revenues decline,” Or, as Mark Zuckerberg puts it, “Companies not countries”. The authors also predicted the impact of coming technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) when they wrote, “Lifetime employment will disappear as jobs increasingly become tasks or piece work rather than positions within an organisation. New survival strategies will evolve involving greater concentration on the development of leisure skills, sports abilities as well as providing services to the growing numbers of sovereign individuals as income inequality within jurisdictions rises.” The tome has had a substantial impact in Silicon Valley with Rees-Mogg travelling there more than a decade after the book's publication to discuss it with students at Stanford University. In 2014, PayPal founder and Trump advisor Peter Thiel told Forbes magazine that The sovereign individual had influenced him more than any other book. Indeed, in recently republished versions of the book Thiel has provided a new foreword. And Thiel’s investments align with these principles where he believes that cryptocurrency ventures will bypass traditional monetary systems. Expect further policy reach in the future in the provision of universal basic income (UBI), which many of these tech bros are very keen on. They understand more than most how many professions are under threat and how many people will be left without work. What are people to do when their labour is no longer required? Perhaps they will spend their time in the fantasy worlds created by technologists, doomscrolling endlessly on Insta and other platforms while being paid by the government via UBI. This is what the author Jonathan Taplin tackles in his book The end of reality when he says “That is my greatest fear: that enchanted by the magic of the Technocrats’ immutable money, infinite frontiers, eternal life we will sleep through a right-wing revolution and wake up to find our democracy gone and our children being turned into Meta cyborgs”. And if you think having Trump as President of the United States with Elon Musk as his sidekick is a nightmare, ponder if you will the dystopian prospect of Mark Zuckerberg running for the highest office. Can you imagine the data he has amassed that could be used to further his political ambitions? What opponents might be suppressed or compromised? Yet as described in Sarah Wynn-Williams recent book Careless people, Zuckerberg has already paved the way for his political ambitions from as far back as 2017 when he finally realised how important Facebook was in the election of Donald Trump. In her insider account, Wynn-Williams wrote, “He also had Facebook’s board approve a new stock structure that would allow him to run for office. The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission expressly allows Mark Zuckerberg to leave Facebook for up to two years without losing control of the company if his absence is ‘in connection with his serving in a government position or office’.” These are not benign actors, scrappy startup founders who move fast and break things - they share world views that are destroying our democracies as we know it. Yet politicians are in thrall to the power that these men yield. We may already be existing in the new technocracy for our times. They already decide how and when we should use their products, removing our choice and agency – consider the recent inclusion of Meta AI into WhatsApp, which you cannot turn off. Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, “I'm from the government and I'm here to help.” So if you hear, “I’m from the technocracy and I’m here to help,” you won't be surprised if it's our new form of government.

Title: Total Control 24 (TC24) Under Review: Best Prostate Health Supplement for Men in 2025

April 14, 2025 20:14 ET | Source: Total Control 24 (TC24) Total Control 24 (TC24) New York City, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- 1. Introduction: Prostate Health in Men Over 40 Prostate health is one of the most overlooked yet critical areas of concern for aging men. As men enter their 40s and beyond, hormonal shifts, inflammation, and lifestyle changes begin to impact the health of the prostate gland—a small but vital organ that supports urinary function and reproductive health. Recent studies reveal that nearly 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men in their 80s suffer from symptoms related to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an age-associated enlargement of the prostate. These symptoms include: For many, these symptoms emerge gradually and are often dismissed as a regular part of aging. However, untreated BPH can significantly reduce quality of life. It disrupts sleep, causes anxiety in social settings, and contributes to chronic fatigue and low mood. Most men are unaware that the underlying triggers are often tied to an overproduction of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), declining testosterone levels, and elevated oxidative stress that inflames the prostate tissue. These biological shifts reduce urinary flow efficiency, disrupt bladder function, and can impact overall male vitality. While prescription medications like alpha-blockers or 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are commonly used, they often come with unwanted side effects such as dizziness, low libido, or sexual dysfunction. That's why more men are turning to natural prostate supplements to regain control of their health—without harsh chemicals. This brings us to Total Control 24 (TC24), a revolutionary prostate support supplement that is being recognized as a top-rated formula for prostate health in men over 40. Designed to support normal prostate size, healthy urinary flow, and hormonal balance, TC24 combines clinically researched, bioavailable ingredients into a powerful daily solution. In this in-depth review, we will examine how Total Control 24 works, explore the top prostate health ingredients, evaluate the science behind its formula, compare it with other popular prostate supplements, and outline the pricing, return policy, and customer satisfaction guarantee. If you are seeking the best prostate health supplement that delivers results naturally, Total Control 24 deserves your attention. 2. Understanding the Problem: Why You're Experiencing Prostate Symptoms As men age, prostate-related discomfort becomes increasingly common—and it's not just about getting older. Several interconnected biological and environmental factors contribute to the gradual decline of prostate function. Understanding these causes is the first step toward lasting relief and better health. Hormonal Shifts and DHT Accumulation One of the primary drivers behind prostate enlargement is the hormonal imbalance that occurs with age. Testosterone levels begin to decline in a man's 40s, while dihydrotestosterone (DHT)—a more potent derivative of testosterone—often remains elevated. DHT can cause the cells in the prostate to multiply excessively, leading to an enlarged gland that puts pressure on the urethra. This creates frustrating urinary issues, including weak stream, urgency, and nighttime urination. Oxidative Stress and Inflammation Oxidative stress occurs when there is an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body. In the prostate, this can lead to inflammation and cellular damage. Chronic inflammation is a key factor in the development of BPH and may even contribute to more serious conditions if not addressed. Antioxidant-rich nutrients, like those found in TC24, help reduce this inflammation and protect the prostate against cellular breakdown. Lifestyle Factors That Exacerbate Symptoms In addition to biological changes, lifestyle habits also influence prostate health. Poor diet, lack of physical activity, alcohol consumption, and chronic stress can all worsen urinary symptoms and hormone imbalances. Additionally, high body fat can lead to increased estrogen production in men, further throwing off the delicate balance of male hormones. The Emotional Toll of Prostate Problems The daily struggle of dealing with frequent bathroom trips, poor sleep, or sexual dissatisfaction is more than a physical burden—it can affect self-confidence, work performance, and relationships. Many men report feeling embarrassed or isolated due to their symptoms, which in turn can lead to anxiety or even depression. Prostate issues are not just an inconvenience; they are an actual quality-of-life issue. The good news is that men do not have to live with these challenges. Addressing the root causes of prostate issues—hormonal imbalance, inflammation, and oxidative stress—can deliver lasting relief. This is precisely where Total Control 24 excels, providing a natural and comprehensive approach to restoring prostate health. Learn More About Total Control 24 Ingredients and How They Support Prostate Wellness 3. What is Total Control 24 (TC24)? Total Control 24 (TC24) is a next-generation prostate health supplement created by Adem Naturals. Designed specifically for men over 40 who are struggling with the signs of prostate enlargement and urinary discomfort, TC24 offers a multi-action formula targeting the key root causes of prostate decline. Rather than simply masking symptoms, TC24 works to support: This advanced supplement is manufactured in the USA in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility. TC24 uses a clean-label formula that is non-GMO, free of gluten and soy, and contains no artificial additives or fillers. Each capsule delivers a potent dose of herbal extracts, minerals, and antioxidants—all of which are selected for their ability to support long-term prostate health. Its formula includes several clinically backed ingredients such as Pygeum Africanum, Lipophytol®, Boron, and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which work synergistically to promote urinary comfort and hormonal harmony. What makes Total Control 24 unique is its strategic formulation: the combination of time-tested herbs and patented nutrients designed for bioavailability, precision dosing, and comprehensive coverage of prostate and urinary functions. Whether you're just starting to notice changes in your urinary habits or have been living with BPH-related discomfort for years, TC24 presents a compelling, natural solution worth considering. The Science Behind Total Control 24 Ingredients Myrciaria Jaboticaba (Jaboticaba) Myrciaria jaboticaba is a Brazilian superfruit known for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is rich in polyphenols such as ellagic acid and anthocyanins, which play a central role in modulating inflammation—a key contributor to prostate enlargement and discomfort. Recent research from the Federal University of Alfenas (2024) demonstrated that jaboticaba peel extract significantly reduces markers of oxidative stress and cellular inflammation. Additionally, a 2020 study published in the journal Food & Function found that its polyphenolic compounds protect DNA from oxidative damage, a critical factor in preventing cellular aging and potential mutation in prostate cells. Further evidence published in Food Chemistry (2025) and ScienceDirect highlights jaboticaba's role in reducing nitric oxide overproduction, which is often elevated in inflamed prostate tissue. This makes jaboticaba an essential component of natural prostate health formulas, helping maintain cellular integrity, reduce swelling, and support normal prostate function. Lipophytol® (Phytosterol Complex) Lipophytol® is a patented microencapsulated phytosterol complex that delivers enhanced bioavailability of beta-sitosterol and related plant sterols. These compounds are known to inhibit 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone closely associated with prostate growth and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Studies confirm that beta-sitosterol can improve urinary flow, reduce post-void residual volume, and alleviate symptoms like urgency and weak stream. Lipophytol®'s advanced encapsulation ensures better stability and absorption, allowing for more consistent and reliable results. As a DHT blocker and bladder support agent, Lipophytol® helps address hormonal imbalances and urinary discomfort, two common issues affecting men with aging prostates. Pygeum africanum (African Plum Tree Bark Extract) Pygeum africanum has been used for decades in European herbal medicine to treat prostate-related urinary symptoms. Its bioactive compounds—phytosterols, triterpenes, and ferulic acid esters—exhibit both anti-inflammatory and anti-androgenic effects. According to a Cochrane meta-analysis and studies published in The American Journal of Medicine, Pygeum extract consistently reduces the frequency of nighttime urination, increases peak urine flow, and lowers the volume of residual urine. It also helps regulate hormonal activity within the prostate, contributing to symptom relief in men with enlarged prostates. With extensive clinical support, Pygeum provides multidimensional benefits, targeting inflammation, supporting hormone regulation, and improving quality of life through enhanced urinary function. Boron Boron is a trace mineral that plays a significant role in maintaining prostate health, particularly through its effects on hormone metabolism and inflammation. Research in Cancer Causes & Control (2007) and other peer-reviewed journals have shown that men with higher boron intake have a lower incidence of prostate cancer. Boron helps balance testosterone and estrogen levels, lowers prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and enhances vitamin D metabolism—all of which are beneficial for prostate tissue maintenance. It also exhibits anti-inflammatory properties by modulating cytokines and reducing oxidative stress markers. In the context of Total Control 24, boron acts as a foundational mineral that enhances hormonal balance and supports prostate health at the cellular level, especially in aging men. Discover Why Total Control 24 Is One of the Best Prostate Supplements for Men Over 40 5. What Makes Total Control 24 the Best Prostate Health Supplement in 2025 With a saturated market full of over-the-counter remedies, herbal blends, and pharmaceutical options, choosing a prostate supplement can be overwhelming. What sets Total Control 24 (TC24) apart is its combination of ingredient quality, formulation integrity, clinical rationale, and consumer-focused transparency. These attributes collectively make TC24 one of the most advanced and trusted prostate support supplements currently available. Superior Ingredient Sourcing and Formulation TC24 stands out by leveraging patented, high-quality ingredients like Lipophytol® and Myrciaria Jaboticaba, which are not found in generic prostate pills. These ingredients are selected based on rigorous scientific evidence supporting their roles in DHT regulation, inflammation reduction, and urinary support. Unlike many supplements that hide behind proprietary blends, TC24 offers transparency in its formulation. Additionally, the supplement is manufactured in a GMP-certified, FDA-registered facility in the USA, ensuring pharmaceutical-grade standards and consistent potency. The clean-label promise—no gluten, soy, artificial binders, or GMOs—further demonstrates the product's commitment to purity and safety. Multi-Pathway Mechanism of Action TC24 doesn't rely on a single mechanism. Instead, it addresses prostate health on multiple fronts: This multi-pronged strategy ensures that users experience relief from both acute symptoms (like frequent urination) and long-term risks (like unchecked prostate growth). Favorable Comparison to Leading Brands Compared to other high-profile prostate formulas such as Super Beta Prostate, ProstaGenix, and Prost-P10x, TC24 excels in ingredient diversity and synergy. While others rely heavily on saw palmetto alone, TC24 integrates a broad spectrum of targeted compounds that work together more effectively. It also offers more excellent value with precision dosing, clinical-grade ingredient selection, and better bioavailability via Lipophytol® delivery. Many competitors overlook absorption optimization, a crucial element when dealing with fat-soluble nutrients like phytosterols. Clean Label and Consumer Safety TC24 is designed for long-term use without dependency or dangerous interactions.

Title: The Business of the AI Labs

Apr 11, 2025 • Max I will soon be joining Anthropic, and so this is my last opportunity to write down some thoughts on the AI lab business model before I can be accused of spilling any inside information. Although large language model (LLM) providers like OpenAI and Anthropic have spearheaded a new AI revolution, it is still not clear at this point that they are good businesses. The question on the minds of investors is whether these pioneering labs will reap profits, or whether instead other parts of the AI ecosystem (hardware vendors, cloud platforms, or end-user companies) will capture the lion’s share of value. This article surveys the competitive landscape and suggests some strategies that the labs could pursue to secure good economics for themselves. (While questions of AI safety its broader societal impact are important, I will leave these topics aside here and focus purely on the financial angle.) I. No technical leader The status quo is that labs are spending considerable resources training successively better models. For example, OpenAI has raised $60bn, Meta is spending as much as $60bn per year, and xAI has raised $12bn. Their reward for deploying these resources is to spend just a few months at the top of the benchmark leaderboards before being supplanted by a competitor. Despite the increasingly secretive development process of LLM technology, no lab has been able to take a decisive technical lead. Why does this happen? Perhaps the most important factor is that the labs are making many parallel discoveries. Technological breakthroughs often appear simultaneously as soon as prerequisites are in place - consider Newton and Leibnitz, or Tesla and Marconi. Even in the case where ideas aren’t rediscovered independently, many of these labs are based in California, where employment law that is hostile to non-compete agreements allows employees - and hence ideas - to flow freely throughout the community. Once public, ideas spread like wildfire. For instance, the Transformer architecture itself (from Google’s 2017 paper “Attention is All You Need”) was rapidly adopted by everyone even in domains far outside the original machine translation usecase. More recently, techniques like LoRA or FlashAttention provide big efficiency gains and are implemented widely mere months after invention. Working in favour of parallel discovery is that LLMs remain fundamentally simple technology, so you might expect that a lot of the improvements that make them better are also relatively simple. Consider that a complete specification for a leading open-source LLM such as Lllama can be written in a few hundred lines of pytorch. Torch itself can be implemented in less than a thousand lines of code. Validating this intuition, Dario Amodei has said that Anthropic has “$100 million secrets that are a few lines of code”. II. Competitors abound Barriers to entry in the industry do not seem to be high - witness, for example, the quick ascendancy of xAI. The technical progress made by incumbent labs can be replicated by making the right hires. Once you have this knowledge, actual model training costs are quite moderate. Notoriously, the Deepseek R3’s main training run cost only $5m. Anthrophic’s CEO, Dario Amodei, reports that Claude 3.5 Sonnet cost “a few $10M’s to train”. Putting these numbers in the context of the multi-billion-dollar funding rounds by the labs, it seems that most of the spend must be on smaller-scale experiments and researcher time - which seemingly only serves to create IP with a very short shelflife. This means that deep-pocketed investors have continued to fund new entrants, fuelling the Red Queen’s race in LLM tech. They do this because of desire for a regional champion (Mistral), concerns about AI safety (Anthropic), to avoid dependence on a limited group of suppliers (Meta), a desire to “democratise” access to AI (Stability), or perhaps just ego (xAI). A related factor keeping barriers to entry low is that of model extraction, where you train your own model on output from another. As early as 2020, a paper found that you could get 90%+ agreement with a victim BERT model for only a few hundred dollars worth of tokens generated by the victim. In 2023, Stanford replicated GPT 3.5’s instruction tuning on a Llama base model using just $500 worth of tokens. By some estimates, a leading LLM can be replicated by training your own model on just 1T output tokens from the victim model: the cost of these tokens for GPT-4o would be just ~$5m. Although there is only weak evidence for it, some suspect that DeepSeek’s frontier models partially owe their excellent benchmark performance to being trained on GPT-4o output. The implication is stark. An LLM lab might invest tens of millions in training a cutting-edge model, only to have others reap the benefits by training cheap knock-offs using its outputs. This dynamic is reminiscent of generic drugs copying a pharmaceutical formula: the R&D investment is large, but once the product is released to the public, copycats can emerge at marginal cost. LLM labs are not blind to this threat. They impose API terms to forbid using their model outputs to train competitors. But enforcement is difficult and moreover, labs face a dilemma: the more widely they distribute and monetize their models (which they need to do to recoup costs), the more they enable potential distillation by third parties. III. Strategic dynamics In classic tech strategy, one way to gain power is to commoditize your complement – make the product or input that you don’t sell cheap and abundant, so that demand (and pricing power) increases for the part you do sell. In the AI ecosystem, we see multiple players applying this strategy against each other: LLM Labs vs. Compute Providers (Nvidia, et al.): Training and inferencing cutting-edge models requires vast compute, much of which is supplied by Nvidia’s GPUs (or similar AI chips). From a lab’s perspective, this dependency is dangerous – if one vendor holds a near-monopoly on hardware, they can extract a lot of the value via high chip prices. Nvidia earns an extraordinary gross margin of more than 70%, even while selling cards at MSRP far lower than the grey market price. LLM labs are thus highly motivated to commoditize the hardware side. We see Anthropic, for example, making sure its models run on a variety of hardware: they use Google’s TPU v5e chips “at scale” for training Claude, and they also partner with Amazon to use AWS’s custom Trainium accelerators. Hyperscalers (Cloud Platforms) vs. LLM Labs: The big cloud providers – Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud – view AI models as valuable content that can drive compute consumption on their platforms. But if one model lab becomes too powerful (able to dictate high prices or exclusive access), it threatens the cloud’s control. So hyperscalers try to commoditize the models themselves. One approach is backing multiple AI labs and open models: e.g. Amazon has invested in Anthropic, while also partnering with smaller startups and supporting open-source Hugging Face models on its Bedrock service. Microsoft has a special relationship with OpenAI, but it also hosts alternatives (like Meta’s LLaMA) on Azure, and develops its own “Phi” model inhouse. Google has its in-house models (PaLM, Gemini, etc.) but also invested in Anthropic to cover a second source. The cloud wants customers to view models as swappable commodities available through its API marketplace and commoditize the LLM model layer, so that the real money is made on cloud infrastructure usage. This is classic complement commoditization: make the AI model cheap (or even free) so that customers use more cloud compute and storage. AI Customers (Enterprises, Tech Companies) vs. Both Labs and Cloud: Large consumer-facing companies like Meta, and many enterprise users of AI, have a stake in not becoming overly dependent on outside AI providers. For them, the AI model (and even cloud) is a input to their core business – a complement to what they do. Their incentive is to commoditize AI capabilities so that they can integrate intelligence into their products without paying monopoly rents. Zuckerberg has described Meta’s open-sourcing of LLaMA in this light: by releasing a high-quality model to the public, Meta hopes to undermine the proprietary advantage of OpenAI et al and ensure a competitive pool of models. If everyone has strong LLMs, no single supplier can overcharge Meta or dominate the market narrative – and Meta itself can benefit from the community improvements on these models. In summary, there is a strategic tug-of-war in the AI ecosystem: Each player tries to commoditize the other layers. This strategic dynamic will heavily influence profit pools. If the hyperscalers succeed, the labs could see their models become low-margin components, with most profit accruing to the cloud platforms selling the compute cycles. And if open-source efforts backed by users succeed, no one supplier may have big margins – AI might become an infrastructure commodity that end-users deploy at cost. IV. A way out? So, LLM labs spend huge resources just to keep pace technically with a growing number of competitors, all while facing intense commoditization pressure from the other actors in the ecosystem. Is there any reason to believe that these can become good businesses? One point of hope is that while OpenAI’s API margins are being compressed, as of early 2024 they were still at a relatively healthy 55% level. More recently, DeepSeek claimed an 80% gross margin. Revenue growth is also extremely healthy - OpenAI expects revenue to triple in 2025. Anthropic is growing even faster, albeit from a lower base. How can these margins and revenue growth levels be sustained long term, given the neck-and-neck nature of the technical race and wide field of competitors? Ideas would include: I think it’s worth paying particular attention to the “drop in remote worker”, as envisioned in e.g. Aschenbrenner’s Situational Awareness. A number of labs (Anthropic, OpenAI, Manus) are working towards an AI agent that you would be able to onboard to your company’s intranet just like any remote employee, and which could then e.g. start to code its way through your JIRA backlog, come up with new product designs, coordinate with suppliers to negotiate costs, or prepare reports on business strategy. This has a number of advantages over the current business of selling tokens: In short, while there are certainly challenges to the AI lab business model, it does seem like there are a lot of strategic options open to them. It seems unlikely to me that the labs will end up being completely commoditized - so maybe there is some hope for my Anthropic stock options after all :-) © - Powered by Jekyll & whiteglass - Subscribe via RSS

Brian Witte, Associated Press Brian Witte, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Barbara Ortutay, Associated Press Leave your feedback WASHINGTON (AP) — A historic antitrust trial began Monday for Meta Platforms Inc. in a case that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The trial is bringing Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg into federal court in Washington to testify. In opening statements, Federal Trade Commission attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used a monopoly to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other Meta witnesses will testify during the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. READ MORE: Meta agrees to pay $25 million settlement to Trump over Jan. 6 suspension lawsuit Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI,” the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past.” This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta’s fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta’s request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC’s narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question,” which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it’s forced to spin off Instagram. Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judge-made developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” Your tax-deductible donation ensures our vital reporting continues to thrive.

If you’re reading this, you probably know the value of the Mercury’s news reporting, arts and culture coverage, event calendar, and the bevy of events we host throughout the year. The work we do helps our city shine, but we can’t do it without your support. If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support! GOOD MORNING, PORTLAND!👋 Hallelujah, get ready for a gorgeous, sunny week ahead with highs in the low-to-mid 70s—and I mean, what could be better? Well, how about the Mercury's absolutely delish PIZZA WEEK which starts today Monday, April 14 and runs through this Sunday? Get your one-of-a-kind scrumptious slices for only four damn dollars from Portland's top 68 (!) pizza slingers all week long. Now line up for your one-of-a-kind NEWS. IN LOCAL NEWS: • In a KGW interview, Mayor Keith Wilson announced he is walking back former Mayor Wheeler's plan to cite and arrest homeless citizens, telling Portland Police Chief Bob Day it's not something he supports. "We cannot arrest our way out of unsheltered homelessness," Wilson said in the interview, "...because all you're guaranteeing when you arrest somebody and or cite them or take them into jail is you're ensuring that person's gonna be homeless for another day." (Hard cut to former commissioner and current truck stop lawyer Rene Gonzalez, as he fumes at the end of the bar at Jubitz's Ponderosa Lounge.) When leaders at the Northwest Oregon Labor Council voted to allow the Portland police union to join their ranks, it prompted a sizable controversy among labor and police accountability advocates. The council will now take a wider vote on the issue at the end of the month.[image or embed] • More than 100 students and supporters gathered on the campus of the University of Oregon Friday to demand that the school's administration do more to protect the international students that are being wrongfully and cruelly deported by the racist Trump administration. At least four U of O students have had their visas revoked for bullshit reasons (such as traffic tickets or for vocally supporting Palestine), and protesters are calling for better protection for the students, which includes using the university's alert system to notify everyone when ICE arrives on campus. • Outdoor enthusiast store REI is making a public apology for signing on to a letter that endorsed Trump's controversial pick for secretary of the interior, Doug Burgum. The former North Dakota governor had championed drilling in the Alaska wilderness, supporting coal, and building housing on federal land, and the new CEO of REI (who was not around when the letter was signed) was like, "Oh HELL no!", retracted the endorsement and apologized. Several companies had signed on to the letter which was intended to give them "a seat at the table to continue outdoor recreation advocacy" or more accurately to cravenly lick the boot of the most despicable, anti-environment president we've had in decades... your choice. “We don’t want people that should not be in the profession, bouncing from place to place,” Yamhill County Sheriff Sam Elliott said. “We want to see that finality so that bad apples aren’t able to fly under the radar, so to speak.”[image or embed] • Rescue workers paused their search yesterday for a kayaker who went over Willamette Falls in Oregon City late Saturday night. While the victim's boat was found, the body was not—but, in a chilling twist, during the search another currently unidentified body was found. The search is expected to resume today. • In case you haven't heard, WAR IS HELL. And the new film Warfare (directed by Alex Garland) really hammers the point home in a bloody, excruciatingly tense tale of battle, which our reviewer Dom Sinacola smartly notes is "hyperfocused on war as existential, experiential terror." Is it your cup of tea? Read the review and see! Let's go, trivia lovers! It's time to play POP QUIZ PDX. In this week's local trivia game: the ultimate in unhygienic recycling, inside Portland's "Witch's Castle," and an ode to the shittiest pizza in the world! 🍕😒 See how well YOU score![image or embed] IN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS: • A Pennsylvania man has been charged with attempted murder and terrorism after setting fire to the home of democratic governor Josh Shapiro, while he and his family were sleeping (thankfully no one was injured). The suspect, Cody Balmer, of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, has not come out and identified himself as a Trumper, but did say he "hated" Shapiro and that if he had confronted the governor, would have beat him to death with a hammer. 😬 • King Fool is threatening the press again, this time going after CBS and its show 60 Minutes, which broadcasted a damning (and absolutely correct) segment on Russia's deadly invasion of Ukraine, and Trump's bizarre threats to take over Greenland. The show infuriated Trump who hopped onto Truth Social to bark that the network would "pay a big price" for going after him reporting truthfully on the news. Trump's poll numbers are plummeting after his disastrous economic policies caused the stock market to crash last week.[image or embed] • Despite all evidence to the contrary, Trump's top physician says that the shambling, presidential pile of bile and Big Macs is in “excellent health.” 😂 While he is currently the oldest person ever elected president, and weighs in at 224 lbs, doctors noted that some of his excess weight can be attributed to Balthamore, the cloven-hooved demon of chaos who currently inhabits his body. Meta is going on trial starting today. The US government is advancing a blockbuster antitrust case, alleging that Mark Zuckerberg’s company illegally built a “social networking monopoly” through years of “anticompetitive conduct.”[image or embed] • Today in grotesque space tourism: Jeff Bezo's "Blue Origin" rocket carried an all female crew (including his girlfriend Lauren Sanchez, TV personality Gayle King, and pop star Katy Perry) for a quick ride into space today, where Perry says she couldn’t resist singing “What a Wonderful World” as she gazed upon the earth below. This has been your Monday morning edition of VOMIT. • And finally... it's the start of a new week, which means it's time to look SHARP.

Good morning. A business owner bought a Cybertruck last year to advertise her company. Now, she's one of many cybertruck owners facing growing hostility and threats of violence. "I paid over $400 to teach my staff self-defense," she writes. Read the full story. In today's newsletter, the tech industry received some welcome news over the weekend — sort of. What's on deck Markets: The spasm in the Treasury market last week was a warning for Trump and the US. Tech: Microsoft just tapped the brakes on its AI data center expansion. Is that a bad sign? Business: Elon Musk's marketing strategy for Tesla made showrooms a "sitting duck" for protesters. But first, Big Tech dares to dream. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Confusion abounds this morning. On Friday, the US Customs and Border Protection said devices like smartphones, computers, and memory chips would be exempt from higher tariffs. "This is the dream scenario for tech investors," Dan Ives, the global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities, posted on X. "Smartphones, chips being excluded is a game-changer scenario when it comes to China tariffs." Global tech titans breathed a sigh of relief … for a moment. Trump took to Truth Social on Sunday with some clarifications. "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'," he wrote, adding: "Especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!" Trump denied there were ever actually exemptions from tariffs because a previous tariff is still in place. "There was no Tariff 'exception'," Trump wrote. "These products are subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.'" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick echoed Trump's comments during an interview with ABC News on Sunday, saying that tech products would be subject to tariffs after an investigation into the effect importing vital tech components has on national security So, not quite an exemption — but exempt-ish. It was still welcome news for Big Tech. As chaotic as the messaging over the weekend was, certain tech products are no longer exposed to the 145% reciprocal tariff on China. US stock futures are up early Monday, with both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rising as much as 1.4%. Apple is up more than 5% in premarket trading. 1. A historic week for markets. Stocks plunged and soared every day last week as Wall Street tried to gauge the impact of Trump's shifting tariffs. BI recapped investors' roller coaster ride. 2. The bond market has flashed a warning sign for the US and Trump. Intense volatility in the usually safe bond market put pressure on President Trump to partly pause the trade war last week. A sell-off in US Treasurys pushed bond yields to their highest level since January. 3. A top strategist is waiting for a stock surge. Piper Sandler's Craig Johnson isn't backing down from his high price target for the S&P 500, even despite current volatility. Here's why he still expects it to surge to 6,600 by year-end. 1. Vibe coding is changing the game for investors and founders. Traditionally, VCs have leaned toward software startup founders with coding expertise. Now, as AI tools pitch in, they have shifting expectations. 2. Tech investors feel a funding chill coming on. The AI boom sparked further interest in tech, but recent market turmoil is prompting some VC firms to hold back on big deals. The whole thing feels a bit like "Groundhog Day," one emerging fund manager told BI. 3. Microsoft took its foot off the AI accelerator. Should we be worried? Microsoft has backed away from data center expansion even though the pace of AI investment hasn't slowed a bit. The move is a troubling step, but it's a strategic recalibration, not a retreat, BI's Alistair Barr writes. 1. Tesla's big blue blunder. Elon Musk's marketing strategy of putting Tesla showrooms in the middle of cities' liberal enclaves has now backfired big-time. Being in high-traffic zones has made the showrooms a sitting duck for protesters. 2. It's easier than ever for businesses to jack up prices. Thanks to a whipsawing economy and modern technology, businesses can now change prices at the drop of a hat. Consumers don't always know why the hikes are happening — and they're exhausted. 3. Teens still <3 Chick-fil-A. The chicken chain is teens' favorite restaurant brand, according to a recent Piper Sandler survey. Chick-fil-A has held the first place spot for seven years in a row, the investment bank told BI, consistently beating out McDonald's.

Menu Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Meta agrees to pay $25 million to settle lawsuit from Trump after Jan. 6 suspension Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. FROM THE ARCHIVES | Is WhatsApp safe? Here's what you need to know WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | FTC's rule banning fake online reviews goes into effect In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram.

April 14, 2025 08:41 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On March 27, 2025, investors in AppLovin (NASDAQ: APP) saw the price of their shares drop $65.92, wiping out about $20 billion of the company’s market value, after prominent short seller Muddy Waters Research revealed its short position in the stock. Muddy Waters’ report comes on the heels of a recently filed securities class action lawsuit, captioned Quiero v. AppLovin Corporation, et al., No. 4:25-cv-02294 (N.D. Cal.). The suit seeks to represent investors who purchased AppLovin securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Hagens Berman is investigating the claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Recent Development: On March 27, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a scathing report titled “AppLovin: Deep Data Analysis Shows APP is Just Another Scammy AdTech Company.” The report’s focus is in part on “retargeting” (a strategy that aims to re-engage potential customers who have previously interacted with a brand), “incrementality” (the additional or incremental lift in sales or conversions that a marketing activity generates), and AppLovin’s compliance with third party platforms’ TOS (terms of service). Muddy Waters contends that “APP e-commerce is Mostly Retargeting, Incrementality is Low, and it Clearly Violates Platforms’ TOS.” Muddy Waters alleges that: AppLovin Corporation (APP) Securities Class Action: The Muddy Waters report follows the filing of a securities class action complaint alleging AppLovin made false and misleading statements, while failing to disclose critical details about its flagship AXON 2.0 digital advertising platform. The company had heavily promoted the platform as "the best and fastest-growing product we’ve ever released." Investors were allegedly led to believe that the platform, which reportedly leverages “cutting-edge AI technologies,” would redefine the digital advertising landscape by enhancing ad placement efficiency and expanding into e-commerce and web-based marketing. However, the alleged narrative first shifted on February 26, 2025, when short sellers Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research published damaging reports that raised pointed questions about the company’s claims. Both research firms accused AppLovin of misleading investors regarding the platform's true capabilities and ethical practices. Fuzzy Panda Research alleged that the company violated app store policies by exploiting user data in questionable ways, predicting that tech giants Apple and Google would ban AppLovin from their app stores. Additionally, they accused AppLovin of “stealing data from Meta” as part of its e-commerce initiatives, foreseeing swift retaliation from Meta. Culper Research criticized the company for allegedly using AXON 2.0 as little more than a promotional facade to obscure the real drivers behind its business strategy. Culper's report further claimed that AppLovin's growth in mobile gaming has relied on “systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations onto users’ phones, with just a single click – an event that is often inadvertent thanks to the Company’s notorious UX gimmicks” and that “each illicit install translates directly to profit.” “We are investigating claims that AppLovin may have misled investors about whether its growth may be attributable to illegitimate conduct,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

By BRIAN WITTE and BARBARA ORTUTAY, AP Technology Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stand on Monday in a historic antitrust trial that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The Federal Trade Commission called Zuckerberg as its first witness, as it seeks to prove that Meta acquired Instagram and WhatsApp to preserve its monopoly in the social networking space. In opening statements, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used its position to generate enormous profits even as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Zuckerberg and other key Meta witnesses will testify throughout the trial. “We’re going to give them their chance to tell their side of the story,” Matheson said. Mark Hansen, an attorney for Meta, said the FTC was making a “grab bag” of arguments that were wrong. He said Meta has plenty of competition and has made improvements to the startups it acquired. “This lawsuit, in summary, is misguided,” Hansen said, adding: “anyway you look at it, consumers have been the big winners.” The trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech.

Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn’t the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google’s case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August.

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. According to the International Monetary Fund’s World Uncertainty Index, 6 weeks ago, measures of global uncertainty reached their third highest level since monthly tracking began in 2008, behind only that year’s global economic turmoil and the pandemic. And as any behavioral scientist—or anyone with common sense for that matter—knows, uncertainty clouds and complicates decision making processes and thus the path to purchase and is something other than the optimal macro-context for marketing or marketers. But so it is, and so it makes the need for chief marketers to challenge norms, thinking and doing entrepreneurially and differently, ever more important. What then makes for an entrepreneurial CMO? At Forbes, and as we have for the four years since we created this recognition, we consider the entrepreneurial CMO one who approaches driving growth neither beholden to the status quo nor to disrupting it for the sake of same. We believe the entrepreneurial CMO understands both what has enduring value and what needs to change, whether within their organizations and/or in how they go to market. They are strategic risk-takers, learning and optimizing based on both what works and, inevitably, what doesn’t, believing that failures aren’t failures if you learn from and get better because of them. They see opportunity in constraints and are relentlessly focused on making and doing more with less, no matter how much they might have. Their entrepreneurial approach to marketing challenges assumptions and what’s come and been done before. It’s a mindset that informs their strategies, and evidence of it is often seen through tactical application and activation, the in-market expression of mindset and approach. So too do we recognize the difference between being a great CMO and a great and entrepreneurial one. Not everyone is both and not everyone who is, is both at the same time. A great CMO focuses on what matters most, on what creates and captures demand, and on how to best allocate limited resources to unlimited opportunities. They eschew the rest as distraction and think about the business and their role in driving it strategically and then execute creatively. However, we consider this to be as fundamental as it is essential, and not in and of itself evidence of an entrepreneurial approach. We also recognize that the “entrepreneurial” must be considered within the specific context of different industries, categories, companies, and markets. Because that which may be business as usual for company X might be an entirely new way of thinking and doing for company Y, and our judging and selection of the fifty CMOs recognized on this year’s list makes efforts to account for this. It’s our conviction that a status-quo approach to marketing is an increasingly challenged one. It’s our belief that an entrepreneurial take on driving growth and on the art, science, and practice of marketing is and will be increasingly important to great—even good—CMOs, as there is no current reason to think these times of radical uncertainty will become anything but more so in the near-future. As reminder, this particular Forbes list is a one-and-done list, which is to say that once someone has appeared on it, they are no longer eligible for it. This year’s cohort represents the most geographically diverse one yet, and as you read through it (presented alphabetically), you’ll find evidence of an entrepreneurial marketing approach from leaders stewarding brands and companies across categories and the globe. Each is a chief marketer—regardless of their titles—who has been selected from among hundreds of nominees, based on open-nominations, and judged by qualitative consideration from amongst their peers, marketing industry and agency leaders, executive recruiters, CMO list alumni, and Forbes, by whom all final decisions were made. Regardless of what and where they market, it’s how they market and compete that finds them recognized on this 4th annual Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 list. As in year’s past, we think you’ll find something to learn from each and all of those recognized and invite you to get to know them below. 2025 Forbes Entrepreneurial CMO 50 tk Because despite a fundamental, global reset for commercial real estate driven by economic uncertainty, office-norm disruptions, and the continued evolution towards a post-pandemic new normal, Baer’s marketing embraces the disruption that comes from “breaking models.” Knowing that the times and category require reinvention, Baer and her team have reimagined CBRE’s brand and client experience, marketing’s mission, structure, capabilities, and audiences, and, as she told Forbes, “built a level of accountability the business had not previously experienced.” During her tenure as CMO of the world’s largest commercial real estate services firm, Baer and her team have challenged outdated paradigms and models. At a time when businesses and policymakers are reevaluating how cities function, Baer and her team created the firm’s Shaping Tomorrow’s Cities initiative, positioning CBRE as more than a services provider by urging industry leaders to rethink economic, demographic, and infrastructure challenges. “[Marketing] stepped up to be the ultimate convener, giving a voice—and a platform—to these consequential themes,” Baer tells Forbes. Since its launch, this program alone has doubled the firm’s client engagement. In Q4 2024, CBRE’s reported revenues increased 16% year-over-year (YoY). Linda Bethea Because Bethea’s focus on “championing unorthodox ways of doing things” ensures the company’s marketing remains agile and continually “tweaked” based on performance. With the company since 2020, Bethea has found new ways to solve problems and meet unmet consumer needs with what she describes as a “test and learn” approach. To these ends, Bethea and her team work to create a culture of learning and risk-taking, embracing what inevitable failures can teach, “curating a wall of ‘fame & shame’ highlighting both our successes and failures to help our team become more comfortable with risk-taking.” Examples of Bethea’s unorthodox and entrepreneurial approach include launching STōK, a “bold” cold-brew brand—not just in partnership with Wrexham AFC but by “sponsoring a stadium in a country where the product isn’t sold?” As she asked Forbes, “what is bolder than that?” Facing budget declines of 70% for International Delight, a $1B+ portfolio brand, Bethea and her team took an insight—75% of 18-24-year-olds watch at least one hour of reality TV weekly—and created a TikTok reality show, Créme House, to drive engagement and growth. In the last quarter reported, Danone saw an increase in like-for-like sales of 5.8% across its North American market. Benjamin Braun Because Braun markets with the conviction that scale isn’t incompatible with agility and that “even if you work for a massive global conglomerate like Samsung you operate as a start-up team.” With a remit including oversight of the company’s marketing across 44 countries, Braun tells Forbes that you can’t “allow yourself to become complacent and slow. You think big and figure out how to deliver without a budget or people. Change,” he says, “is driven by people with ideas. Not budgets.” For Braun, marketing isn’t just about storytelling—it’s about proving real business results because, and as he says, “only then will we gain credibility.” Illustrations of this and his entrepreneurial approach are seen in the brand’s activation at the Paris Olympics. Rather than spending millions on advertising, Braun and his team went guerrilla—gifting 17,000 Samsung foldable phones to Olympians and Paralympians, requesting only that they unpack them on social media. This led to “Victory Selfies” on Olympic podiums, massive global exposure at a fraction of the cost, and a 23% sales increase. International online research data and analytics firm YouGov recently named Samsung the #1 Best Global Brand for 2025. Heidi Browning Because as sports’ traditional broadcast model evolves to a multi-platform and direct-to-consumer one, Browning markets knowing engaging the next generation of fans requires a transformation in skills and approach. Equating the entrepreneurial mindset driving the league’s marketing to the “cowboy ethos” she learned growing up in Montana, Browning tells Forbes, this cowboy spirit creates the “fearless pursuit of new frontiers, question(ing) everything; both why and why not; and being comfortable with the unknown.” To ensure the NHL’s continued growth, Browning and her team apply the lessons of start-up culture to invite new fans and revenues into the sport and league. Examples include creating the Power Players Youth Advisory Board, embedding Gen Z perspectives directly into marketing decisions to ensure future generation relevance, launching an original content docuseries, “Face-Off: Inside the NHL,” with Amazon Studios among others, and which succeeded in driving both upper and lower funnel growth metrics. The NHL saw record-breaking business performance in 2023-24, with revenue reaching $6.2 billion, a 5.7% year-over-year increase, and total attendance hitting an all-time high of 22.9 million. Jason Bunge Because when Bunge joined the 102-year-old toy category icon as its first CMO in 2023, “there was,” as he told Forbes, “the opportunity and need to build an entirely new marketing organization; construct a new set of marketing capabilities to snap to the company’s evolving business portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, redefine the role of marketing for the different needs of each business.” The former Riot Games CMO and his team approach driving growth recognizing the challenges and opportunities for the company’s principal business lines (toys, physical games and digital/video games) “are bespoke, and the marketing organization must be able to demonstrate agility, efficiency and scale in how it addresses each.” To these ends, Bunge carved out 5% of their budget “for a first-of-its-kind company test-and-learn agenda,” in order “to inject a new mindset of ‘roles of brands’, (because) not everything was going to grow and not everything needed the same type or amount of marketing.” This approach drove insights allowing Bunge and his team to understand where resources would have the greatest impact and return. As Bunge shared, “having an entrepreneurial mindset sometimes means breaking old habits and fighting hard to create space and oxygen for new approaches.” Emma Chalwin Because as she leads all marketing globally for this enterprise software company, Chalwin is intent on driving growth by “breaking the B2B mold.” As Chalwin and her team disrupt Workday’s traditional marketing and ensure it is anything but category-typical, she never loses sight of the fact that, as she told Forbes, “we’re not just selling to a business; we’re selling to the people who work there.” This human-centric approach to enterprise marketing is driven by a mindset rooted in what she describes as rule-breaking, risk-taking and acting like “an entrepreneur inside a Fortune 500 company.” Believing that challenging the status quo of B2B marketing requires a sense of humor and resolve, she and her team launched the Rock Star 2.0 campaign, bringing an “unexpected irreverence” that challenged conceptions about who the rock stars of business are. Chalwin tells Forbes the campaign increased web traffic by over 50% and lead-to-sales conversions by 17%. She’s also working to train 20,000 employees as brand ambassadors to ensure everyone can share a consistent and compelling brand story. Workday’s FY25 revenues increased 16.4% YoY. Kim Chappell Because in order to compete against industry Goliaths, Chappell is helping build this infant formula company into more than just a business and is reshaping conversations and expectations about modern parenting. For Chappell, being an entrepreneurial marketer isn’t just a mindset—it’s a muscle. As she told Forbes, “you have to train yourself to move in the moment without hesitation—with limited resources and often without a blueprint for success. If you don’t go do the work, it’s just another idea, what-if, or magic moment lost.” One example of Chappell’s approach to advancing the conversations driving Bobbie’s growth, is when a Times Square billboard featuring culinary influencer Molly Baz, pregnant, in underwear, and holding lactation cookies over her breasts was removed for violating the billboard owner’s guidelines, Chappell and her team saw opportunity and moved to both seize and make the moment. In only two weeks, Bobbie had Baz back on a Times Square billboard, this time breastfeeding her newborn—a cultural first—and apt illustration of Chappell’s entrepreneurial conviction that “not everything needs a quarter of planning to be on brand, bold and successful.” Chappell tells Forbes that over the past year, Bobbie has become the fastest-growing brand in its category. Daniel Cherry III Because for Cherry, entrepreneurial marketing is about “always being in beta, and instead of fearing failure embracing it as critical feedback pushing ideas one step closer to thrilling the consumer.” As Cherry helped lead the brand through the very public early-end of its controversial partnership with Kanye West his perspective on failure as feedback would make the difference. “We suffered a crisis of confidence and almost believed the hype,” he told Forbes. But rather than replacing the void left by the end of that partnership with another, Cherry thought and did differently, turning to adidas’ greatest asset—its archive—and creating “Originals LA.” Intended as a new business unit not just a marketing approach, Cherry’s idea for moving the business forward looked backwards. By tapping the brand’s archives, Cherry and his team helped put adidas back at the center of sneaker culture, as evidenced by the near ubiquity of Sambas and Gazelles over the past year. Cherry also built forward, championing new collaborations blending nostalgia with modernity, launching initiatives like the adidas Foundation, and restructuring creative workflows to give designers greater autonomy. For the quarter ending December 2024, company revenues had increased nearly 24% YoY. Kristyn Cook Because in the crowded and complex insurance market, Cook leads marketing for this category leader with a conviction that it’s only by “taking the right calculated risks where you have opportunity to win big.” Importantly though, the work Cook leads proves entrepreneurial marketing doesn’t always mean chasing reinvention for reinvention’s sake, Cook and her team are amplifying State Farm’s most powerful assets—its signature red, iconic jingle, and, of course, Jake from State Farm—by positioning them in high-profile, real-world moments that matter. “Our goal is to stay nimble so we can jump in on trending cultural moments,” Cook told Forbes. As examples, the brand has been a first-mover in the category in Gaming, and when Donna Kelce became a cultural focal point, State Farm took advantage of the moment by placing Jake next to her at a game, amplifying brand I.P. and creating a clutter-breaking moment for the brand. A 25-year company veteran, Cook oversees both marketing and sales. And in support of the 18,000 agents in its network, she and her team “always strive to be ‘market movers’ in any space in which we play.” Phil Cook Because during an explosion in interest from fans and partners alike, Cook, the league’s first CMO, is ensuring the WNBA isn’t just riding a wave of growth but actively driving it. Cook and his team are creating a new marketing playbook for the WNBA and its rising stars, during a time of unprecedented attention on women’s basketball. While most leagues pay little attention to their players’ pasts once drafted,Cook and his team took a different strategic approach with their “Welcome to the W” campaign, as college stars including Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese and Cameron Brink segued from the NCAA to the WNBA. In leading efforts to bridge the players’ college and pro journeys, the campaign leaned heavily into the players’ college pasts, creating a narrative continuity helping grow the league’s fan-base on the players’ existing ones. This, as well as a differentiated commitment to social impact, a heightened focus on dimensionalizing player narratives, and creating a 24/7 content hub for the league amongst other efforts, are driving unprecedented numbers for the WNBA. Last year witnessed the largest rights deal in the league’s history, an aggregated $2.2B across ESPN, Amazon and NBCUniversal; sponsorship revenue and demand exploded, as attendance increased 48% and sellout games 242% YoY. Stefano Curti Because with a determination to “make a large company small again,” Curti is ensuring leaner teams and faster decision-making help transform Coty into a nimbler player across the global beauty category. As the leader of a transformation that’s revitalized brand icons like CoverGirl and Rimmel, Curti’s entrepreneurial approach is rooted in speed and connection. In order to mirror the approach of smaller and niche-beauty players, and nurture the brands’ internal “cool factor,” he and his team created an internal incubator, Agile Beauty, which operates like a startup within Coty. Since its inception, the incubator has developed trend-driven products in just eight months, an industry-best for a global beauty powerhouse. To these same ends, Curti and his team have built new advocacy and community programs, engaging influencers and beauty creators not only to amplify storytelling but to co-develop products. With a remit spanning Europe, North America, and high-growth markets like India, Latin America, and the Middle East, Curti and his team are expanding Coty’s global footprint while leveraging its dominance in prestige fragrance—a category he calls “the skincare of the mind”—to drive future innovation and consumer engagement. Coty reported 10% net revenue growth in 2024, outpacing the 9% global beauty market increase. Carmen DeRosas Because by challenging status quo and conventional industry norms, DeRosas is redefining what marketing is in the UAE’s financial services category, and helping lead the transformation of one of the oldest banking institutions in the country. Since arriving at Rakbank, DeRosas tells Forbes she has “implemented a culture of continuous experimentation…that continues to challenge and improve our models,” evidence of which can be seen in a near 60% reduction in agency costs and 50% increase in asset turnaround times during her tenure. Ensuring that marketing is a driver of the company’s innovation and transformation, has DeRosas and her team embracing a challenger brand ethos and shifting mindsets “from fear to exploration,” which she credits with helping drive “the step change we have created across all marketing disciplines, from transforming the way we show up, reshaping agency partnerships, launching campaigns that have elevated brand perception and performance, to delivering a 4x uplift in digital acquisition.” With industry expertise honed during time at PayPal and American Express, DeRosas’s remit includes overseeing the Rakbank brand, its insurance technology platform Protego, and family finance app Skiply. Since getting to Rakbank, DeRosas and her team have driven a major shift in marketing’s role at the bank—and their enhanced brand focus has contributed to a 13-point increase in employee engagement, reinforcing her belief that a strong, people-first culture is key to sustained innovation and growth. Rakbank had record-breaking financial performance last year, and a 16.4% increase in net profits YoY. Carole Diarra Because the “vision to see beyond traditional strategies and the agility to act on them in ways that drive real impact” is helping Diarra fuel the iconic brand’s transformation from its comfort-first origins to a broader fashion and lifestyle business. With a global remit, Diara and her team are redefining what UGG is, where it shows up, and how it connects with its audience. Under her marketing leadership, they’re doing this by focusing on a combination of “agile media thinking” that is inverting status-quo channel approaches, a media-mix strategy shift to social-first, real-time creative decision making, and liberating their marketing from the category’s traditional seasonal emphasis. An illustration of the latter and Diarra’s enhanced emphasis on consumer-led innovation is the brand’s “UGG Season” platform which, as Diarra shared with Forbes, “didn’t start from us but from our community (including Cardi B)...we didn’t create the movement; we recognized and amplified it, letting culture lead our strategy.” This entrepreneurial approach, one untethered to the past, is also evident in UGG’s unexpected collaborations with Paris Fashion Week, and fashion-forward brands including Sacai and Telfar. A core part of the Deckers’ portfolio, for Q3FY25, the UGG brand reported +16.1% increase in net sales YoY. Cristina Diezhandino Because Diezhandino’s marketing for Diageo’s 200 brands is rooted in a “mindset of possibility” and an approach that she told Forbes, values ”progress over perfection. It’s okay to fail as long as we learn.” Despite category headwinds created by a changing world and consumer attitudes and behaviors, Diezhandino realizes that what doesn’t change is the need to stay “centered around celebrations, culture and memorable moments” and that this in turn requires her marketing organization to “understand—and shape the future of—socializing better than anyone else.” To these ends, Diezhandino and her team have built a marketing organization thriving on “connected decisioning,” curiosity, agility, experimentation, reorganizing marketing into “agile brand communities” which allows them to better turn insight into action. To accelerate the growth of $100+ (USD) brands, Diezhandino created the Diageo Luxury Group, uniting its luxury portfolio. To ensure her organization has the tools to act fast in evolving markets, Diezhandino spearheaded initiatives including a Virtual Studio “revolutionizing how we create content”, a global partnerships lab, and Diageo’s largest consumer data initiative. With responsibility for marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the global portfolio, Diezhandino is thinking and doing differently to ensure Diageo’s place in socializing’s future. Brian Donnelly Because Donnelly understands that “speed is a competitive advantage” and, as he tells Forbes, while “there’s a comfort in the ‘tried and true,’ challenging norms, experimenting fearlessly, and pivoting quickly, allows us to adapt and refine strategies in real-time.” With P&L accountability for the 40-year-old genealogy brand’s global business operations, Donnelly’s remit includes oversight of marketing, growth, and business development across the 130 countries where they do business. Intent on “inspiring a culture of innovation across the business” Donnelly and his team identified a growth opportunity, creating a new market by leveraging their genetic testing expertise and applying it to the pet category for the first time. Focused on driving growth by marketing and raising awareness “of the emotional, cultural and personal benefits that come from discovering your roots,” Donnelly and his team are pushing boundaries and experimenting with the new as they reshape Ancestry’s brand, commerce, and customer engagement. Donnelly reports that brand health metrics are rising and that, in 2024, the company saw double-digit growth in DNA kit sales. As of May 1, Donnelly will become the Chief Commercial Officer at Myriad Genetics. Bené Eaton Because in leading marketing globally for this DTC healthcare brand, Eaton’s entrepreneurial approach balances boldness and precision, and as she told Forbes, “isn’t just about disrupting—but about building something meaningful and enduring.” With a remit spanning 34 countries, Eaton and her team lean into the company’s entrepreneurial DNA to fuel their own. For Eaton, entrepreneurial marketing “isn’t just about growth (but) about redefining how a brand can impact people, culture and the world.” To these ends, and as one example, Eaton and her team led Figs to become Team USA’s official Medical Team Outfitter, creating a global stage and moment celebrating the community in a never-been-done-before way. She says the effort drove “significant incremental revenue...but more than the numbers, this campaign redefined how healthcare professionals are perceived.” The LA fires, which devastated the company’s hometown, provide further illustration as Eaton and her team mobilized to quickly support over 1,500 displaced healthcare professionals. “This wasn’t just a crisis response—but testament to our entrepreneurial mindset: acting with urgency, empathy, and impact to show up for our community in moments that matter most.” Colin Fleming Because with a “stubborn intolerance of mediocrity,” Fleming focuses, as he tells Forbes on “what could be, and refusing to be discouraged by the status quo.” Insistent that “none of the Bs in ‘B2B’ should stand for boring,” Fleming and his team are proving that bold storytelling, culture-shaping campaigns, and a strong point of view will drive growth regardless of sector. With a remit leading ServiceNow’s end-to-end global marketing, planning and operations, Fleming has evolved company strategy from product-led to brand-led. As he and his team seek “exponential thinking and big, bold ideas that break the mold,” they’ve rolled out the company’s most comprehensive global campaign ever, high-profile and perception shifting partnerships, and “Project Marie Kondo,” which led to cutting 50% of their content creation to ensure focus on what “sparks joy” for customers. “This simplification” he told us, “frees our teams to concentrate on impact and alignment rather than volume.” For the 12 months ending as of the date of this writing, Service Now’s market capitalization was up 22%. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in ServiceNow.) Adrian Fung Because Fung brings a “founder’s mentality” to the iconic ecommerce brand, focusing, as he told Forbes, on “treating every dollar like it’s your own, and finding scrappy ways to leverage existing assets, customers, partners.” For Fung, a global remit for marketing a brand and multi-category business like eBay’s, with some 130 million customers and over 2.1 billion listings, requires an approach he defines as “learning fast rather than failing fast.” And in order to leverage learnings to drive innovation at scale, Fung recognizes the need “to balance speed and agility with the complexity and scale of eBay’s (business). To do this, we identify small but high leverage opportunities that can be quickly tested and iterated upon to optimize impact.” One example: An initially small-scale test with Facebook Marketplace in Germany which enabled buyers to browse eBay listings directly on Marketplace, rolled out internationally. Recognizing “this type of innovation can’t be achieved from marketing alone - and requires an end-to-end approach” finds Fung breaking down silos and challenging how problems are solved across the business. As of this writing, eBay’s stock was up over 58% YoY. Arielle Gross Samuels Because with a global mandate across all marketing and communications, the former Blackstone CMO and 10-year Meta veteran, is looking to help redefine the company’s place in its category and is “building from zero to one.” In a category-atypical approach, Gross Samuels is using what she tells Forbes is “surround-sound, cross-channel storytelling as a strategic commercial lever.” To help lead the brand beyond its venture capital origins to that of a global investment and transformation company, Samuels and her team launched “Venture Beyond”, not just a campaign but an invitation to their ecosystem of founders, entrepreneurs, and business leaders. She credits the launch with “invigorating our ecosystem and expanding what’s possible. “ For the year ahead, among other things, Gross Samuels and her team are focused on “unveiling new strategic brand partnerships with major platforms, revitalizing our social strategy with franchised branded series, and convening first-of-their-kind forums to catalyze our community—all in service to ecosystem transformation.” By ensuring “we play our own game and operate as a category of one,” Gross Samuels and her team are continuing to help redefine what people know of and expect from General Catalyst. Gail Horwood Because Horwood doesn’t see constraint in the pharmaceutical category’s deeply regulated environment but a catalyst for integrating “now and next practices” redefining how the company markets to drive impact. To better connect with their multiple constituencies, Horwood and her team have championed and facilitated the “creative and innovative;” building Novartis’ Innovation and Content Labs, and establishing its Media Center of Excellence, leading them to explore non-traditional category channels and audiences. They’ve turned to gaming as a way to educate healthcare professionals and “set new standards for audience engagement in the pharma industry.” And while in many categories a Super Bowl ad is no proof of the entrepreneurial, in January, Horwood and her team broke company and category conventions with a campaign to raise awareness and drive screenings for breast cancer. The ad’s creative was bold by any measure, especially within the context of pharma, and is a case study proving that any category’s work can be emotionally resonant. As Horwood told Forbes, “we didn’t want to just show up; we wanted people to receive the message and take action.” A subsequent announcement of a broader partnership with the NFL “merges the power of sports, culture, and health advocacy in a way that has never been done before.” As of their Q4 reporting, Novartis’s stock was up over 15% YoY. Charisse Hughes Because Hughes is proving that legacy CPG brands can lead cultural conversations—and drive growth while doing it. Since joining Kellanova (formerly Kellogg Company), Hughes has transformed the company’s marketing approach, leaning into bold, unconventional collaborations and innovations that extend beyond the company’s broad portfolio of household names, including Kellogg’s Pringles, and Cheez-Its, themselves. As Hughes told Forbes, “in an era where traditional marketing strategies aren't enough, we have embraced unconventional, culturally resonant collaborations that push boundaries...(and) elevate our brands beyond transactional products to cultural icons.” To these ends, one example of the work Hughes and her team have done is the collaboration between Crocs and Pringles, which went beyond a mere licensing deal in order to create mutually inspired products for both brands. This included the insta-worthy Pringles-inspired slides and the Crush Boot which sold out in under two hours, driving earned media in publications like GQ, not typically known for paying attention to pantry brands. In August, Mars, Inc. offered to acquire Kellanova for $36 billion. If it closes, this will be the largest CPG deal in over a decade. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 51% YoY. Kerttu Inkeroinen Because Inkeroinen leads marketing for this six-year-old UK-based alcohol-free beer brand with a “Break Rules, Honor Traditions” mantra, which she says, “allows us to challenge category norms while respecting beer culture.” Despite having only a fraction of the marketing budget of her multinational competitors, Inkeroinen “approaches every decision with big budget energy,” telling Forbes she “sees opportunities where others see limitations and with the resilience—what we call sisu in Finnish—to push through.” And while some may consider process and entrepreneurial agility to be opposed, Inkeroinen doesn’t considering “a well-structured framework what enables fast, efficient scaling.” To these ends, she and her team introduced a cross-functional “gate process” to ensure rapid execution without quality compromises, and built a proprietary digital platform to, among other things, drive pint giveaways in pubs, an in-house innovation that she credits with “removing cost barriers and unlocking new distribution opportunities.” Inkeroinen leads marketing, communications, innovation, and e-commerce for the brand. Her entrepreneurial approach has helped Lucky Saint become what she says is the most loved and most Googled alcohol-free beer in the U.K. Marissa Jarrett Because for Jarratt “acting like an entrepreneur is a cornerstone of how I lead and inspire my team,” an approach driving how she has built the marketing organization for this global retail giant. Focused on ensuring 7-Eleven doesn’t just keep pace with cultural and consumer shifts but actively drives them while navigating market volatility and new resource constraints, Jarratt emphasizes agility, creativity, and resilience. With broad responsibilities in the U.S. and Canada across marketing, corporate communications, and sustainability, Jarratt and her teams navigated “over 220 reputation-critical issues, implementing a three-tier crisis management strategy,” introduced “Big Bite Hot Dog-Flavored Sparkling Water” on April Fool’s Day to recruit Gen Z customers and publicize the launch of their private label sparkling water brand. The creatively dissonant effort drove a nearly 10% month-over-month increase in store brand sales and a 12% increase across the category; expanded 7-Eleven’s in-house creative agency, producing campaigns faster and cheaper, all while also reducing plastic bag usage by 37%. Jarratt is intent on “steering the brand out of a challenging 2024” and will continue enhancing the retailer’s “ability to adapt and innovate, even in a resource-constrained environment. Nicolas Kettelhake Because in a digital world saturated with “perfect” images, Kettelhake is reinvigorating an 80-year-old analog brand, making what’s old new again by proving that imperfection sells. Kettelhake and his team market by counterprogramming and leaning away from—rather than into—digital cultural trends. Because Polaroid images can’t be retouched, Kettelhake and his team have delivered what he described to Forbes as “a counter to digitized, altered, ‘perfect’ photography, because Polaroid is one of one, and inherently imperfect due to the chemical development process.” Kettelhake ensures the brand’s claim to a positioning rooted in the tactile and imperfect not only drives communication but product innovation. To make a statement against the endlessly replicable nature of digital images, he and his team have elevated the craft of instant photography by appealing to high-end professional photographers, invited digitally-native consumers into the brand by becoming part of sub-cultures, and created a new membership program. By zigging while culture zags, Kettelhake’s integrated, multi-channel and cohort approach has sold-out both new products and film, and driven YoY double digit sell-through increase across the full business. Kettelhake left Polaroid as of April 1st. Drieke Leenknegt Because Leenknegt understands that in the ever-changing consumer landscape, today’s “marketing isn’t about incremental change—it’s about transformation.” Despite its globally iconic brand status, Leenknegt inherited a business facing years of declining revenue and a turnaround imperative. Her entrepreneurial approach to marketing has helped reverse Vans’ decline and position it for long-term growth. Since joining two years ago, Leenknegt has restructured the company’s global marketing team, going beyond necessary surface-level adjustments to deep, strategic reinvention that is connecting dots across marketing, product, and commerce. All of this is driving what she tells Forbes is “agility, alignment, and profitability, ensuring innovation is more than just an idea.” Leenknegt and her team are embracing and deploying an “always on marketing model...that balances reinvention with authenticity.” Illustration is found in their creation and launch of a new pinnacle segment, OTW by Vans, at Paris Fashion Week. Describing this as both a product and cultural innovation, Leenknegt credits the innovation with fueling extraordinary sell-through and, as being but one effort that is helping restore brand momentum. Diego Lomanto Because without the tens of billions of dollars raised by competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic, Lomanto leads marketing for this startup generative AI enterprise solution, certain that “winning in AI isn’t just about who builds the best model, but about who owns the conversation.” Given their relative resource constraints, Lomanto and his team approach owning the conversation by ensuring Writer is, as he told Forbes, “impossible to ignore to the folks we wanted to have a conversation with...that wherever AI decision-makers looked, they saw Writer, setting us apart in a highly competitive, scrutinizing and often hesitant market.” The brand’s outsized presence on stage, in headlines, and on billboards along Silicon Valley’s busiest highways was just one part of its scrappy reach and frequency strategy. Certain that “the entrepreneurial marketer knows the best marketing comes from customers who can’t stop talking about their ROI,” Lomanto created a program targeting analysts, a.k.a. the influencers of the AI category, marketing the brand as an ROI catalyst and movement, turning “our biggest successes—for companies like Salesforce and Uber—into our biggest marketing assets.” At the end of 2024, the company raised an additional $200 million, increasing its valuation to $1.9 billion. Victoria Lozano Because despite Crayola’s dominant market share, Lozano pushes the business to think and market like a challenger, redefining not just what Crayola sells, but repositioning the brand and business by repositioning creativity itself. Lozano and her team have redefined how the company creates commercial value. As Lozano told Forbes, “Crayola is a bigger brand than business,” and in order to capitalize on the former and overcome the latter, she and her team are shifting long-held but limiting parental perceptions about Crayola as just an arts-and-crafts brand by marketing “beyond the crayon,” embedding the brand deeper into family routines and educational systems. To these ends, Lozano launched Campaign for Creativity, an advocacy movement reframing creativity—and Crayola’s role in it—as a critical life skill; and built Crayola Studios, a content development and production division that creates programming across genres for kids and their parents. The studio already has some dozen partnerships, including those with parent company Hallmark, a BBC Kids partnership, and a brand partnership with audiobook platform Audible. Lozano’s entrepreneurial approach is reframing the brand, its scope, and creating new sources of revenue. Martina Luger Because as Luger leads marketing for this, U.K. based hospitality enterprise, she’s rejecting the category’s traditional price-based segmentation, and instead deploying a narrative-driven model to position and differentiate the company’s brands. With a portfolio including The Mondrian, Hoxton and SLS brands, Luger and her team focus on disruptive lifestyle strategies rooted in her conviction that safe ground never leads to innovation. As she told Forbes, the entrepreneurial marketer has to have “the courage to stand on the edge of a cliff because only at the edge do you get the most amazing views.” Luger and her team are “making the statement that our hotels are more than just transactional decisions,” an approach further illustrated by Ennismore’s “game-changing” loyalty program, “Dis-loyalty.” Luger shared that while “traditional loyalty models reward people for sticking to the familiar—we wanted to flip that idea on its head,” and with no points, tiers, or blackout dates, members get 20% off first-time stays, and 10% off return visits, part of what’s driving growth across her global remit for marketing 17 brands, and over 170 hotels in more than 35 countries with another 120+ in the pipeline. Astha Malik Because certain “there has never been a better time to be a better marketer,” Malik is unconstrained by the tried and true and untethered to industry standards and expectations. With a broad remit across this SaaS platform’s corporate strategy, global expansion, and growth initiatives redefining how brands connect with their audiences—and how Braze connects with its, Malik encourages innovation, as she told Forbes, by ensuring her teams are “comfortable with failure—because it’s not final.” Malik and her team created the company’s Innovation Lab, 427°, a consulting initiative providing clients agency like services during and post-sales in order to help them rethink customer connections at scale to provide clients, because Malik believes “the best marketing doesn’t just drive pipeline, it builds enduring and valuable relationships. The Lab, but one illustration of her entrepreneurial approach in action, has “accelerated sales cycles, improved satisfaction, and set us apart.” Malik remains intent on challenging assumptions about the CMO role, ensuring marketing always has a seat at the Board table, and “challenging everyday actions and standing out when others may prefer to just fit in.” For Q4 25, the company reported YoY revenue growth of 22%. Devika Mathrani Because in an increasingly competitive healthcare landscape, Mathrani is “shaping the future of health care and changing the conversation in the category” for one of the nation’s top 10 healthcare systems, by bringing unconventional strategies to a category not known for same. Mathrani and her team are challenged not just by their competitive set but also a glut of healthcare disinformation. When “alongside the rise of (public health) misinformation, we recognized the need to inform and empower consumers”, as Mathrani told Forbes, they launched a newsroom operation to “publish trusted information—helping people navigate their health proactively and reactively.” When New York City faced a critical blood-supply shortage, Mathrani and her team drove essential donations by turning donations into a limited-edition product drop, applying a scarcity marketing model common in footwear but not in healthcare. Partnering with renowned pastry chef Dominique Ansel, creator of the Cronut, donating blood became the only way to get Ansel’s “3 Lives Bar.” Thinking and acting outside category norms led to a 25,000 percent (not a typo) increase in traffic to the donation site, and a 40% increase in donations. Stephanie McCarty Because McCarty is challenging home-building category norms, transforming a traditionally rigid and slow-moving process in order to fundamentally reshape how buyers navigate one of the most significant purchases of their lives. With oversight of marketing for one of the nation’s largest homebuilders, McCarty told Forbes she is intent “not just on adapting to change but driving it, ensuring our marketing plays a critical role in our growth and shaping the future of the industry.” McCarty and her team have led the company to create a fully-digital shopping experience, an “unheard of” first for the homebuilding category. As she told Forbes, this consumer-centric innovation drove meaningfully higher conversion rates, exponentially reduced cancellations, and increased revenue. McCarty, whose remit includes overseeing marketing and consumer engagement across 21 markets, has also redefined how homebuilders connect with consumers, turning social media from a branding tool into a direct revenue driver, another category first. Despite an environment marked by significantly higher interest rates, as of this writing, the company’s stock was up over 7% YoY. Sarah Moore Because as Moore leads marketing for the culturally iconic restaurant chain, she does so with the conviction that entrepreneurial marketing “is not just the high-stakes journey of a disruptive startup—but about leading transformation when the odds are against you—when competition is fierce, behaviors are shifting, and a brand must evolve or fade.” With oversight of all marketing for the chain’s 660+ locations, including brand, culinary menu architecture, and pricing strategy, Moore and her team are driven by “bucking category norms...and the relentless pursuit of discomfort.” As rising egg prices became their own source of discomfort for customers nationally, Moore told Forbes that she and her team flipped the competitive script and, “instead of raising prices (like competitors), we launched a rewards promotion where members earned extra for egg-based dishes.” She credits the simple and counter-intuitive move with driving higher guest frequency and spend and adding 6 million new loyalty program members in just year one. Modernizing a brand that is literally rooted in the “old” is no small challenge. But Moore’s take on being an entrepreneurial CMO “isn’t just about building something new. It’s also about reinventing, reimaging, and revitalizing something that already exists.” Michael Moses Because in a landscape where “all the content in the world is the push of a button away,” Moses markets acutely aware that “launching every film is akin to launching a new business...every few weeks.” Over the past year ,Moses, who has been with Universal for 25 years, seven as global CMO, oversaw marketing for a portfolio including Wicked and The Fall Guy, and as he told Forbes, always with a “healthily skeptical eye on data because its proliferation is an alluring siren call that risks narrowcasting the audience and making all our approaches homogenized.” For “Twisters”, overcoming this siren call meant tapping into an overlooked Heartland audience through country music partnerships and broadening the film’s appeal without alienating traditional moviegoers. For “The Wild Robot”, Moses and his team took a slow-burn strategy—festival screenings, a dialogue-free trailer—helping make it 2024’s top original animated title and making “Wicked” a ubiquitous cultural presence. In 2024, Universal led the domestic box office, surpassing $1.9 billion in ticket sales and securing four of the year’s top 10 highest-grossing films. Nicole Parlapiano Because in leading marketing globally for this FOX owned ad-supported streamer, Parlapiano is “stripping fear from the equation and leaning into risk (to) drive business growth.” As Parlapiano sees it, marketing today requires not just doing differently but thinking dangerously. With this in mind, as she told Forbes, she looks to identify “marketers who have dangerous ideas,” and that while she has “done work that could fail, it’s better to throw your hat in the ring than to wait for perfection.” Along with a broad remit to grow Tubi’s brand and audience, Parlapiano works closely with the streamer’s B2B team in order to demonstrate how valuable Tubi’s viewers are to advertisers. To these ends, her creatively dissonant “Tubi Is More Popular Than” campaign did just this, reframing both brand and business. Also, Parlapiano and her team launched Stubios, a “first-to-market product” for aspiring filmmakers and their fans, that gives the camera to “anyone who has a story and puts the power to greenlight in the hands of the viewer.” The first class of Stubio projects goes live later this year. Over the past year, Tubi has seen monthly-average-user growth of 23% YoY. Lynn Pina Because Pina drives marketing for this travel medical insurance brand with what she describes as an “owner’s mindset.” As she told Forbes, “when you see yourself as an employee only, you can be passive, complacent, and easily defeated. With an owner’s mindset, I’m relentless about finding solutions and creative approaches to achieve the desired outcome.” For Pina, whose remit includes Marketing, Product and Customer Experience, driving growth with entrepreneurial marketing approach is about “striking the right balance between building and breaking,” a perspective that has served Pina and the company well, in the highly regulated category, and over the past year in particular. In just six months—rather than the usual 18-24—Pina and her team led the creation and launch of a new product and partnership, Globaline, which significantly expanded the GeoBlue’s portfolio and market reach. Doing so required Pina and her team to challenge assumptions, break down barriers, and build from scratch, all while working across two companies with two different cultures and competing priorities. Pina reports that the product launch reached 80% of its first-year goal within just six months. Surhabi Pokhyrial Because as digital has become 70% of the 186-year-old CPG company’s media mix, Pokhriyal works to “scale fast and scrap fast” in a landscape where “many new shiny things come and fizzle often.” For brands including household names like Arm & Hammer, Trojan and Waterpic, Pokhriyal tells Forbes that, over the past year, she and her teams have “started using social as the ‘third shelf’ and have partnered with some 4000 influencers in order to create “a virtuous cycle for social engagement drives online and in-store sales.” This, along with ensuring “’no-dead-end media’ and that over 90% of our media is shoppable, is how our teams truly scale fast and scrap fast when needed.” Knowing that today’s status quo can be disrupted in an instant, she and her team “keep raising the bar with readiness not just for the here and now, but for tomorrow.” Pokhriyal credits this approach—and a “healthy sense of paranoia”—with helping “drive outsized eCommerce growth versus CPG peers.” In the last year, Church & Dwight’s revenue growth surpassed its outlook and, according to sources, outperformed its competitors. Amanda Rubin Because since joining the world’s most profitable hedge-fund, Rubin is redefining what marketing means and does in a firm and industry that has long operated behind closed doors. As Rubin told Forbes, entrepreneurial marketing “requires not only showing others what needs to be done, but more importantly, what else is possible even when it deviates from the status quo.” Until Rubin, Citadel’s marketing status quo relied largely on earned media-driven awareness of the firm’s financial acumen, with little time given to its brand or that of its founder, Ken Griffin’s. Facing “a fierce war for talent and very public scrutiny”, Rubin built Citadel’s marketing function from the ground up to better position the company—and Griffin’s philanthropic efforts—among what she describes as a “complex ecosystem of audiences, from talent to commercial clients, regulators and policy-makers...none of their journeys are linear, and their perceptions have enduring impact on our commercial success.” By actively building a marketing narrative, making visible what had historically been opaque, and deploying a multi-faceted content strategy across dozens of new touchpoints and channels, Rubin and her team have helped drive a 50% YoY increase in talent applications, while concurrently tripling awareness of Griffin’s philanthropic initiatives. 1x1_John Schoolcraft Because Schoolcraft conceived and built a new-model approach to creating a category and driving growth for this oat-milk brand and company. Schoolcraft takes pains to make clear he is not a CMO and that Oatly doesn’t have a marketing department “at all” but a creative one, something he made a stipulation for joining the company in 2012. As he told Forbes, he believes “marketing departments are filters, and it is always better to work with makers and problem solvers and not approvers.” This perspective led Schoolcraft to build the “Oatly Department of Mind Control” (ODMC), which he describes as a team of creative problem solvers,” instead of a traditional marketing organization. “The ODMC doesn’t solve isolated marketing or brand problems, we understand everything is tied together, so look to solve business problems...(sitting) in on meetings from innovation to finance gives the creative department ownership and understanding of the business, which turns all of us into entrepreneurs.” While one might argue with his definitions, Schoolcraft’s approach is working. Despite slowing growth in the plant-based food category globally, 12+ years in, Oatly continues seeing double-digit sales increases YoY. Alex Schultz Because with an unusually broad remit for a CMO, including global oversight of all analytics and business, public affairs, brand and direct response consumer marketing across Meta and its brand portfolio, the analytically-driven Schultz marries the quantitative and qualitative helping disrupt and reinvent how the company drives business outcomes. While WhatsApp is dominant outside the U.S., in the U.S., it remains a challenger brand. Recognizing that the biggest brand-unlock for the messaging app would be product—not marketing—driven initially, Schultz and his team “deployed product changes to make sharing to WhatsApp easier” before launching the brand’s largest US campaign to date. This effort, “direct response ads using our platforms and others...(which) bent the curve on topline growth.” Identifying an internal lag-time stifling growth of the company’s burgeoning live-shopping ad business, where customers wanted to boost ad-spends but the internal ad-review period “meant the live video would be over by the time we approved the ads,” Schultz and his team brought the idea and insight needed to help the product team reimagine the review process, and leading to what he tells Forbes is “explosive growth of live shopping with business messaging.” At the end of 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 21.94% YoY. (Disclosure: One of the editors working on this list owns stock in Meta.) Geoff Seeley Because as PayPal’s business evolves, Seeley is helping drive “a new approach to product-led marketing that spins our consumer and merchant flywheel even faster.” Seeley’s role as marketing leader is to help conceive and realize new product innovation, and take these products to market across their 450 million customers, 35 million merchants, 200 markets, B2B and B2C, and family of brands, including its eponymous one, Venmo and Honey, In his first year since joining as Global CMO, Seeley drove what he describes as “one of the most significant strategic and executional transformations in our history.” Focused on, as he told Forbes, “revolutionizing global commerce again” Seeley and his team are “working back from (our) customers to create the next innovations.” Evidence of this and Seeley’s intent to catalyze growth by changing how people think about and use the company’s products is seen in the launch of PayPal’s largest-ever program, “Everywhere,” and its partnership with, among others, Apple Wallet, and in how he and his team are capitalizing on Venmo’s becoming a verb, and “subvert(ing) that soundbite to introduce people to a much wider world of Venmo.” As of this writing, the company’s stock is up more than 18% YoY. Peter Semple Because Semple “thinks of our brand, our experience and our proposition as ‘Always WIP’...obsessing about the context in which we operate and reflecting on how we might react. Our conviction to act is the entrepreneurial mindset in action.” With a remit for the Etsy-owned marketplace that includes oversight for brand marketing and communications, merchandising, media, seller growth, and an in-house creative studio, Semple tells Forbes he is “consistently iterating on the brand we present to the world, and the combination of channels and messages we leverage to bring that brand into peoples’ lives.” Focused on audience expansion, brand differentiation, and market share growth in the U.S. and Australia, Semple and his team are unafraid to broaden the brand’s platform and appeal beyond their traditional core demographic. Illustrations of their entrepreneurial approach in action includes expanding Depop’s advocacy programs across 100 U.S. college campuses, cultivating a new generation of engaged brand ambassadors and, also in the US, removing seller fees in order to further differentiate the brand and business, lowering barriers to entry, and leading to material YoY market share growth. In March, Semple was named interim CEO of the company. Jinal Shah Because Shah is driving growth for the buy-now-pay-later platform, by “challenging assumptions, moving with urgency, and transforming constraints into advantages.” Having led the company through multiple strategic evolutions since joining in 2021, Shah and her team are now stewarding Zip through what she describes as its hyper-growth phase with a certainty that “opportunity is created, not waited for.” Focused on “rewriting how people experience financial empowerment,” in the crowded and regulated industry, Shah and her organization are “embedding payment flexibility into everyday passions” including NASCAR, MLB, and concerts. To decrease the brand’s reliance on search networks Shah and her team built Commerce Media, a proprietary and brand-direct model, turning a profitability experiment into a fully independent business unit. Shah has also reframed customer experience, typically an “afterthought in fintech” into a competitive differentiator and, as she told us, “from an operations cost center to a brand accelerator.” Recognizing that “entrepreneurship is about building teams that can scale the mission,” in the past year, she and her teams helped Zip realize a 45% revenue increase YoY. Charlie Smith Because Smith is “pushing the boundaries of luxury fashion communication and perhaps even brand communication in general” for the LVMH-owned brand. In a category long reliant on exclusivity, polish, and reverence, Smith and his team are rewriting the rules—and the brand’s renown—by taking LOEWE in an unexpected and different direction, one where irreverence, lo-fi aesthetics, and surprising collaborations challenge convention, and transcending category constructs. For Smith and his team, challenging the status quo is rooted in what he told Forbes is their “collective willingness to embrace failure enabling us to push boundaries.” Over the past year, Smith’s How to Pronounce LOEWE campaign “tackled head-on that many don’t know how to pronounce our name, something other brands might have shied away from.” He and his team turned a might-have-been-traditional celebrity campaign with Daniel Craig into subversive storytelling, creating “a fresh context and a lot of conversation.” Similarly, LOEWE’s Suna Fujita collaboration reimagined the Japanese ceramist duo’s whimsical figures as an animated universe, pop-ups, and a children’s book, blending artistry with commerce in an entirely new way. Despite a challenging period for many luxury labels, in October, reports indicated LOEWE’s sales had increased 27.5% YoY. In March, long-time Creative Director Jonathan Anderson left the label, and Jack McCollough and Lazaro Hernandez were appointed. John Solomon Because as Solomon leads global marketing for this wellness pioneer, “the biggest breakthroughs haven’t come from rigid planning; they’ve emerged from a willingness to seize unplanned, unbudgeted opportunities driving real consumer connection.” The private-equity backed company is expanding into new verticals, markets, and audiences, without a commensurate expansion in marketing resources, but for Solomon and his team, “with no roadmap and limited resources”, as he told Forbes, “proved that speed and ingenuity can outpace size and budget constraints.” By leaning into other brands’ reach to supplement their own, Solomon and his team forged relationships with Sephora, developing a co-brand product leading to a 50% increase in the vertical YoY; with United Airlines to drive trial in their lounges; and when faced with the challenge of excess inventory, partnered with Hollywood and sports powerhouse CAA, to “turn a potential problem into an opportunity,” executing Name, Image and Likeness deals with tier 1 college football programs, “to ensure Therabody was in the hands of the next generation of elite athletes—who eagerly shared their experience on social media.” Despite their flat marketing budget, Solomon reports their core wellness category grew 40% YoY. Marc Speichert Because Speichert, the first to have this title and combination of B2B and B2C responsibilities in the iconic brand’s corporate history, is reimagining where the brand plays and how commercial returns are driven. Recognizing that organizational structure either facilitates or limits growth, over the past year, Speichert has integrated teams once operating separately, telling Forbes he has optimized “end-to-end strategy and execution,” reimagining corporate structure with “mirror organizations...embedding subject matter experts within regions, allowing them to drive local agendas with autonomy, agility, and greater self-sufficiency.” Long synonymous with hotel luxury, for Speichert and his team, driving growth and innovating at scale, has led them to take the brand into new businesses and categories. This includes launching the first branded Yacht voyage in January, which he describes as “creating something entirely new that challenges industry norms.” At the same time, the brand’s ongoing relationship with HBO’s The White Lotus, was credited by Wallpaper as “achieving something few luxury brands manage: catapulting into mainstream awareness while maintaining exclusivity.” Speichert tells Forbes that these efforts and others are not only identifying and commercializing untapped “white space” but also leading the privately-owned company to record-breaking performance. Kate Trumbull Because, over the past year, in a category challenged by macro-economics and constrained consumer spending, Trumbull markets the iconic QSR brand determined to “get speeding tickets, not parking tickets,” as she told Forbes. Trumbull leads marketing for the brand and its 20,000 franchisees with an action-first approach believing “people will like you for what you say, but they’ll love you for what you do.” For Trumbull and her team, brand actions are redefining “value-driven initiatives beyond price (to) break through the sea of the same offers” that have historically driven the category by “turning consumer value into talk value.” Efforts have included countering shrinkflation with MOREflation, reimagining a traditional buy-one-get-one offer as a brand equity moment with their Emergency Pizza 2.0 campaign, and turning a basic $3 coupon on its head with their You Tip, We Tip driver-appreciation effort. With oversight of Domino’s marketing, product innovation, strategic partnerships and national sales, in over 90 global markets, and despite economic headwinds, Domino’s has posted three consecutive quarters of U.S. same-store sales and order growth. As of this writing, the company’s stock is up over 6% YoY. Sumit Virmani Because as he leads global marketing for the India-based IT services company, Virmani “values the entrepreneurial attitude over mere skills, celebrating risk-taking, experimentation and recognizing excellence through failures that teach, not just successes.” Despite competing against global companies that are better resourced and funded, it’s this approach to marketing that is driving how Virmani and his team create differentiated and deeper connections to the brand as a short-term and long-term growth lever. Evidence of the approach in action includes Infosys’s move into sonic branding, a strategy more typical for B2C marketers than B2B, where brand identity is typically limited to the visual. Certain that “B2B clients (also) value an emotive connection and there’s no reason for B2B to appeal only to the visual sense,” Virmani and his team launched of The Sound of Opportunity—a sonic signature, which was played more than 5 million times in its first six months. As AI continues shaping and reshaping the marketing landscape, Virmani is determined to ensure Infosys helps lead the way for its clients and prospective ones by investing “deeply” in its brand. Over the past five years, and according to Brand Finance, Infosys’s brand value has increased by 15% YoY, and the fastest-growing IT Services brand over the last 5 years. Marc Weinstock Because Weinstock markets the studio’s slate of films understanding that in today’s rapidly changing content landscape a “think-different mindset is crucial. If you can’t think outside the box and blaze a new trail, you’ll simply fall flat.” Over the past year, and for films and sequels including “Sonic the Hedgehog 3”, “A Quiet Place: Day One”, and “Gladiator 2”, Weinstock and his team were responsible not just for “creating or recreating a brand from the ground up nearly every four weeks” as he told Forbes but, more relevantly, for leading the studio to five #1 domestic openings and three franchise-best sequel performances, despite sequels typically underperforming the originals. For Weinstock, success requires not just overcoming competition—but inertia and staying home—and makes marketing innovation mission critical, leading Weinstock and his team to work “with key platforms in ways no one’s ever done.” Examples include partnering with Snapchat to “reach every one of their users at once,” and a “Mission Impossible” interstitial starring Tom Cruise in this year’s Super Bowl. In the midst of the parent company’s reorganizations and sale process, in 2024, Paramount’s filmed entertainment division revenues increased 67% YoY. Kate Wik Because when a brand is as defined in the public consciousness as Las Vegas, expanding perceptions required Wik to reinvent the traditional destination marketing playbook. With a remit to market and sell Vegas globally and, as Wik told Forbes, “in an increasingly noisy world, with an abundance of competition in every category” breaking through requires thinking entrepreneurially. To these ends, Wik and her team expanded on the city’s entertainment roots by focusing on two marquee events, Super Bowl LVIII and Formula 1. But, shifting perceptions for one of the most “branded” cities in the world, required going beyond “sponsorship” and doing things differently. Wik “challenged my teams and my partnerships with the NFL and Formula 1 to leverage their spotlights as a year-round marketing platform.” By thinking beyond the traditional window, she and her team helped reset the rules of destination marketing. “My product is Las Vegas,” Wik told Forbes, and the results of her repositioning it as “The Sports and Entertainment Capital of the World” are measured in broadened perceptions of a brand historically linked to “What Happens Here Stays Here,” and in billions of dollars in direct revenues. Edoardo Zegna Because in a marketing landscape evolving at warp speed, this fourth-generation leader of the Italian brand’s founding family says, “my goal is to make Zegna the slowest company in the world.” Zegna’s approach to driving the business is instead rooted in his belief that, as he told Forbes, “to build a product that lasts forever, you have to be slow; patience and time are indispensable ingredients to create a timeless brand.” This perspective finds the brand’s marketing not disrupting category convention so much as ignoring it. Describing his role at the 115-year-old company, not by his multi-hyphenate remit but as “the custodian of Zegna feelings”, he and his team see their work as he told another publication about creating “unscalable ideas and then figuring out a way to scale them.” All but singularly focused on giving space—often literal—to stories and the emotions they engender, Zegna and his team launched, among other platforms, Villa Zegna, a private-club pop-up bringing the brand’s heritage to life in key markets globally; turned a children’s book about the company’s origins into a week-long immersive experience in Milan, the first Zenga event with no clothes in it; and are creating Oasi Zegna (a Zegna Oasis) destinations around the world, as places to be slow and as metaphor for ZEGNA’s commitment to sustainability, craftsmanship, and lasting impact.

Title: Meta faces antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram, WhatsApp

Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses Meta Platforms Inc. faces a historic antitrust trial beginning Monday that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses. The looming antitrust trial will be the first big test of President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump's first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market. Meta, the FTC argues, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” the FTC says in its complaint, just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. “Unable to maintain its monopoly by fairly competing, the company’s executives addressed the existential threat by buying up new innovators that were succeeding where Facebook failed,” the FTC says. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. “The FTC already has the difficult task, whether it’s looking at 10 years ago or five years ago or today, of trying to define what is the market we’re talking about in a sufficiently narrow way that it can show Meta has a ton of power in that market,” said Paul Swanson, an antitrust attorney for the law firm Holland & Hart. “And I do think that challenge has gotten harder as the years have gone by and we see more and more potential competitors in social media spaces.” Meta, meanwhile, says the FTC’s lawsuit “defies reality.” “The evidence at trial will show what every 17-year-old in the world knows: Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp compete with Chinese-owned TikTok, YouTube, X, iMessage and many others. More than 10 years after the FTC reviewed and cleared our acquisitions, the Commission’s action in this case sends the message that no deal is ever truly final. Regulators should be supporting American innovation, rather than seeking to break up a great American company and further advantaging China on critical issues like AI," the company said in a statement. In a filing last week, Meta also stressed that the FTC “must prove that Meta has monopoly power in its claimed relevant market now, not at some time in the past." This, experts say, could also prove challenging since more competitors have emerged in the social media space in the years since the company bought WhatsApp and Instagram. Meta's fate will be decided by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who late last year denied Meta's request for a summary judgment and ruled that the case must go to trial. Boasberg “seems to be skeptical” of the FTC's narrow market definition in his rulings to date, Swanson said. He added that the judge also said it is a “fact question," which means he is open to hearing what the FTC and its experts have to say to define that narrow market. While the FTC may face an uphill battle in proving its case, the stakes are high for Meta, whose advertising business could be cut in half if it's forced to spin off Instagram. “Instagram is now Meta’s biggest money maker in the U.S., its most lucrative market, where the app accounts for 50.5% of the company’s ad revenues in 2025. Instagram has also been picking up the slack for Facebook on the user front, particularly among young people, for a long time,” said Emarketer analyst Jasmine Enberg. “The trial also comes as Meta is trying to bring back OG Facebook in an effort to appeal to Gen Z and younger users as they join social media. Social media usage is far more fragmented today than it was in 2012 when Facebook acquired Instagram, and Facebook isn’t where the cool college kids hang out anymore. Meta needs Instagram to continue growing, especially as more advertisers think Instagram-first with their Meta budgets.” But Meta isn't the only technology company in the sights of federal antitrust regulators, Google and Amazon face their own cases. The remedy phase of Google's case is scheduled to begin on April 21. A federal judge declared the search giant an illegal monopoly last August. “A big theme here is we are applying 19th-century laws to 21st-century markets. And I think it’s an open question whether the judgment developments to antitrust law can keep up with markets as they are changing — these fluid and dynamic tech markets in particular,” Swanson said. “And this will be a case that speaks directly to that.” 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

US Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption.

Lutnick's comments Sunday made clear that more changes were on the way, including a policy specific to the computer chip industry. On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president's realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the US any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the US for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. Semiconductors from China under US scrutiny as Trump warns of fresh tariffs What's more, it would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the US, and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech's “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven's combined market value had plunged by USD2.1 trillion, or 14 per cent, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to USD 644 billion, or a 4 per cent decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech's hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden's administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the US during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump's first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move removes “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment over the weekend.

WFTV Now NASHVILLE, Tenn. — (AP) — Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren't usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Sparing electronics was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an anticipated tech stock rally on Monday.

It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday.

Title: Are Stocks And Yields Signaling Something Sinister?

Time Published: 2025-04-13T12:18:17Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. President Trump mentioned bond yields when he paused some tariff increases last week. After the ... More pause, stock registered their third-largest one day gain since 1950. The causes of higher yields and the history of outsized one-day gains are examined. Updated, Apr. 14, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the date of Liberation Day, which was April 2, not April 4. Stocks began trading lower last week, continuing the selloff after President Donald Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on Wednesday, April 2, which sparked the stock plunge in the previous week. The S&P 500 reached bear market territory intraday on Monday, down 21% from the mid-February closing high, as concerns about negative economic consequences from the tariffs grew. On Wednesday, Trump announced a temporary reduction in the reciprocal tariff rates to 10% for 60 countries previously hit with higher tariffs. The tariff rate on China was increased to 125%. Stocks reacted with a record-setting one-day rally on Wednesday as the perceived risk of a global recession and trade war was reduced. Largest 1-Day S&P 500 Gains Since 1950 The easing in tariff worries sent stocks 5.7% higher last week. After this week’s rally, the S&P 500 sits 12.7% below its mid-February high. Though the Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed last week, the group remains in bear market territory at 22.5% below the mid-December all-time high. Market Performance Notably, in a change from earlier in the tariff-related stock weakness, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury rose instead of falling. For example, during the week of March 31, when the S&P 500 fell 9.1%, the 10-year yield fell from 4.2% to 4.0%. Last week, yields continued to rise even while stocks were soft in the first half of the trading week. This is important because lower yields can help the economy and are the typical bond reaction during worries about economic growth. In addition, the usual flight to U.S. Treasuries as safe assets helps diversified investors offset some of the stock losses during bear markets. Recall that bond prices rise when yields fall and vice versa. Trump even said the bond market was “getting a little queasy” when he paused the higher tariff rates for 90 days last Wednesday. Interestingly, the rise in yields did not come from higher inflation expectations. Instead, the 50 basis point (0.50%) increase in the 10-year Treasury yield from April 4 to April 11 was from an increase in the real yield demanded by investors. This means investors are demanding more compensation for owning U.S. Treasuries. Typically, this happens when expectations for economic growth increase since investors are less interested in safety and are offered attractive expected returns on risk assets like stocks during these periods. Given the likelihood that higher tariffs will effectively act as a tax increase, they should be a headwind to economic growth. So, the typical primary reason for higher real yields is not the most plausible. Instead, investors in the 10-year Treasury demanded higher yields to invest in U.S. debt for another reason. The drivers probably include several reasons, including increased perceived risk plus seasonal and bond market structural factors. 10-Year US Treasury Note: Yield Decomposition The financial market volatility surrounding the tariffs has likely pressured some common trades and arbitrages within the bond market. One way to see this risk is by looking at Treasury asset swaps in which one side pays the fixed coupon on the 10-year U.S. Treasury and receives the variable Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The volatility of the U.S. swap spreads around the tariff announcements suggests that some of these trades could have been liquidated and helped send yields higher. US Swap Spread Looking at a past period of financial stress, similar periods of rising Treasury yields can be seen as swap spreads become volatile. This chart shows swap spreads and the 10-year yield around the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank on Mar. 10, 2023. US Swap Spreads: Silicon Valley Bank Collapse Period There is also talk that some parties had highly leveraged basis trades in place and were forced to unwind them during the volatility, pushing yields higher. Basis trades attempt to profit from the difference between a futures price and a similar bond price. The recent decline in the U.S. dollar relative to other countries’ currencies could be evidence that other countries are selling some U.S. Treasuries. Investors from different countries might also be demanding a higher yield to compensate them for the falling value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies. US Dollar Weakness Seasonally, one could also expect some pressure on yields as tax payments are due on April 15. Both individual and corporate taxpayers could be liquidating or not demanding as many Treasury bonds to have cash available to make their tax payments. In addition, with the robust rally in risk assets last week, higher yields should be expected. In summary, it looks unlikely that the tariffs caused permanent damage to the status of the U.S. dollar and Treasuries as a safe haven. The primary focus will likely remain on tariffs, with markets watching for any changes in US policy and retaliation or concessions from other countries. Late last Friday, smartphones, computers, and other electronics were excluded from the tariffs, including those from China. Companies like Apple, which sources significant electronics from China, should see some relief. Since the consumer is the key to U.S. economic growth, Wednesday’s retail sales remains notable. The data will still be looked at skeptically since the full brunt of the tariffs will not be reflected in the March numbers. First quarter earnings season began slowly last week, with a few large banks reporting on Friday. The pace picks up slightly this week, with more banks and notable companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), American Express (AXP), and Netflix (NFLX) scheduled to report earnings. While the last quarter’s earnings always take a back seat to future guidance, this season's situation will be even more extreme, with investors trying to determine the upcoming earnings bite from the tariffs and any retaliation. S&P 500 Earnings Season The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), which is also called the fear gauge, can help illustrate the level of fear that gripped the markets around the tariff announcements. The VIX measures the expected volatility in the price of the S&P 500 over the next 30 days, using the implied volatility of options on stocks. Some market participants use volatility to measure risk since it is the only thing that can be easily measured. In reality, price volatility does not indicate risk for long-term investors. Still, the probability of a permanent capital loss is not easily measured, so volatility is used instead. Within the plumbing of financial markets, higher volatility tends to cause a reduction in liquidity across most assets as those parties typically providing liquidity reduce the size of their capital at risk. This lower liquidity can cause large swings to the downside and the upside. Volatility Risk Last Wednesday, the S&P 500 had its third-largest one-day gain since 1950. Some have posited that extreme one-day gains are associated with bear markets rather than a positive stock outlook. Using data from Strategas Research Partners, the shorter-term periods following these large jumps have indeed seen mixed results. For example, the S&P 500 was higher 58% of the time in the three months after the 25 most significant one-day gains since 1950. Things look significantly better when the investment horizon is lengthened to a year, with the S&P 500 higher almost 92% of the time. Frequency Of Positive S&P 500 Returns After Large 1-Day Gains Further bringing home the point, the range of returns for those shorter periods following the outsized one-day gains is quite sizable. If history is a guide, the risk versus reward for investors looking out a year looks appetizing. Range Of Returns Following Large 1-Day Gains It seems reasonable from the history of stock returns following the largest one-day gains and the unsettled tariff situation that investors should expect volatility to persist for some time. Stocks have provided the highest long-term annualized return of any asset class, but the price for that stellar history is periods of intense volatility and temporary steep declines. Stock’s dominance in growing wealth relative to other investments was achieved through world wars, trade wars, severe economic downturns, financial crises, and pandemics. So, there is no reason to believe that increased tariffs, a hotter trade war with China, or a recession will change the long-term positive outcome, though it can make the short-term uncomfortable.

April 13, 2025 07:56 ET | Source: Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi LLP Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Securities Litigation Partner James (Josh) Wilson Encourages Investors Who Suffered Losses In AppLovin To Contact Him Directly To Discuss Their Options If you purchased or acquired securities in AppLovin between May 10, 2023 to February 25, 2025 and would like to discuss your legal rights, call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310). [You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member.

The Trump administration late Friday said they would exclude electronics like smartphones and laptops from reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for popular consumer electronics that aren’t usually made in the U.S. It would also benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia and sets the stage for a likely tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to the current 145% tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It’s the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in their massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. The exemption seemed to reflect the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever, despite the administration’s predictions that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time. But that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. What’s more, It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., and then confront Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone, threatening to torpedo sales of its marquee product. Trump’s decision to exempt the iPhone and other popular electronics made in China mirrors the similar relief that he gave those products during the trade war of his first term in the White House. But Trump began his second term seemingly determined to impose the tariffs more broad this time, triggering a meltdown in the market values of Apple and other technology powerhouses. The turmoil battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” — Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point earlier this week, the combined Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. Some of the losses eased this past Wednesday when Trump paused the tariffs outside of China, paring the lost value in the Magnificent Seven to $644 billion, or a 4% decline, from April 2. Now, the stage is set for another tech rally Monday when trading resumes in the U.S. stock market, with Apple likely leading the way because the iPhones made in China remain the company’s biggest money maker. The electronics exemption also should relieve consumer worries that the China tariffs would result in hefty price hikes on smartphones and other devices that have become essential tools of modern living, It’s the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration’s and help propel an already booming industry to even greater heights. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. The move takes off “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to a request for comment Saturday. Nvidia declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura, File) Tariff exemptions announced Friday on electronics like smartphones and laptops are only a temporary reprieve until the Trump administration develops a new tariff approach specific to the semiconductor industry, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday. White House officials, including President Donald Trump himself, spent Sunday downplaying the significance of exemptions that lessen but won't eliminate the effect of U.S. tariffs on imports of popular consumer devices and their key components. Recommended Videos “They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC's “This Week” on Sunday. Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs.

It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever.

Trump added to the confusion hours later, declaring on social media that there was no “exception” at all because the goods are “just moving to a different" bucket and will still face a 20% tariff as part of his administration's move to punish China for its role in fentanyl trafficking. The Trump administration late Friday had said it would exclude electronics from broader so-called reciprocal tariffs, a move that could help keep the prices down for phones and other consumer products that aren’t usually made in the U.S. China's commerce ministry in a Sunday statement welcomed the change as a small step even as it called for the U.S. to completely cancel the rest of its tariffs. Sparing electronics was expected to benefit big tech companies like Apple and Samsung and chip makers like Nvidia, though the uncertainty of future tariffs may rein in an anticipated tech stock rally on Monday. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said items like smartphones, laptops, hard drives, flat-panel monitors and some chips would qualify for the exemption. Machines used to make semiconductors are excluded too. That means they won’t be subject to most of the tariffs levied on China or the 10% baseline tariffs elsewhere. It was the latest tariff change by the Trump administration, which has made several U-turns in its massive plan to put tariffs in place on goods from most countries. White House officials sought to dismiss any suggestion of a reprieve as the weekend progressed. “It’s not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it,” U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “This type of supply chain moved from the tariff regime for the global tariff, the reciprocal tariff, and it moved to the national security tariff regime.” Greer added that “the president decided that we’re not going to have exemptions. We can’t have a Swiss cheese solution to this universal problem that we’re facing.” On Air Force One Saturday night, President Donald Trump told reporters he would get into more specifics on exemptions on Monday. In his post Sunday on TruthSocial, he promised the White House was “taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN.” Some had assumed the exemption filed Friday night reflected the president’s realization that his China tariffs are unlikely to shift more manufacturing of smartphones, computers and other gadgets to the U.S. any time soon, if ever. The administration has predicted that the trade war prod Apple to make iPhones in the U.S. for the first time, but that was an unlikely scenario after Apple spent decades building up a finely calibrated supply chain in China. It would take several years and cost billions of dollars to build new plants in the U.S., burdening Apple with economic forces that could triple the price of an iPhone and torpedo sales of its marquee product. The turmoil has battered the stocks of tech’s “Magnificent Seven” -- Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. At one point, the Magnificent Seven’s combined market value had plunged by $2.1 trillion, or 14%, from April 2 when Trump unveiled sweeping tariffs on a wide range of countries. When Trump paused the tariffs outside of China on Wednesday, the lost value in those companies was pared to $644 billion, or a 4% decline. An electronics exemption would fulfill the kind of friendly treatment that industry was envisioning when Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos assembled behind the president during his Jan. 20 inauguration. That united display of fealty reflected Big Tech’s hopes that Trump would be more accommodating than President Joe Biden’s administration. Apple won praise from Trump in late February when the Cupertino, California, company committed to invest $500 billion and add 20,000 jobs in the U.S. during the next four years. The pledge was an echo of a $350 billion investment commitment in the U.S. that Apple made during Trump’s first term when the iPhone was exempted from China tariffs. An electronics exemption would remove “a huge black cloud overhang for now over the tech sector and the pressure facing U.S. Big Tech,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a research note. Ives amended that note after Lutnick's comments Sunday, saying the confusing news out of the White House “is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand.” Neither Apple nor Samsung responded to requests for comment over the weekend. Nvidia declined to comment. ___ O'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

Title: Tax Breaks: The Week That Turned Out To Be A Wild Ride Edition

ByKelly Phillips Erb ByKelly Phillips Erb, Forbes Staff. The week was a rollercoaster for investors. The big news this week was the stock market. U.S. stocks tumbled as traders grappled with the consequences of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The S&P 500—a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 leading companies in the U.S.—which hit a record high on February 19, dropped quickly on Tuesday, the second-fastest such drop in history (lagging only behind the drop due to Covid). Stocks powered back after Trump announced a 90-day reprieve on most tariffs but dropped again. By the end of the week, investors felt like they had motion sickness after one of the most volatile periods on record for Wall Street. Losing money inside your brokerage or retirement account may hurt—but it doesn’t necessarily mean a loss for federal tax purposes. Markets go up and down—it's the nature of the beast. When the market goes down, that doesn't equal an actual or realized loss for tax purposes. Similarly, when the market goes back up, that doesn't equal a real or realized gain for tax purposes. For tax purposes, gains and losses aren't determined moment to moment or from those highs and lows, but how much your cost basis has gone up or down from when you acquired the asset to the disposition of the asset. To realize a gain or a loss for tax purposes, you must do something with the asset. Typically, that means that you sell it or otherwise dispose of it. (The tax rules can be more complicated for day traders.) Things were equally as hectic at the IRS. A Treasury announcement confirmed that Melanie Krause, the acting commissioner of the IRS, was leaving her position. The announcement followed the news that the tax agency agreed to share immigrant tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Under the agreement, the IRS will verify the names and addresses of immigrants provided on tax records to ICE. It's unclear what other information may be provided by the IRS. However, an initial lawsuit suggests it could include information about dependents and other personal information. Krause stepped in as acting commissioner in early March following the retirement announcement of Doug O'Donnell. O'Donnell had served in the role for just a few short weeks following former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel's departure on January 20, 2025 (one week before the tax season officially kicked off). O'Donnell's departure on February 28 marked a remarkable 39-day span of rotating commissioners. Krause becomes the third commissioner or acting commissioner to leave the agency in less than 80 days. The IRS is also bracing for more cuts in its workforce. Thousands of agency employees are expected to receive pink slips in mid-May, about a month after Tax Day, April 15. About 11,000 cuts are predicted, bringing the total loss of employees in the first half of 2025 to 20,000. With a few days left before Tax Day, cracks are showing at the IRS. Millions of taxpayers are expected to file their federal income tax returns by the end of the day on April 15, 2025, with millions more expected to file for an extension. It's not the ideal time for mistakes to appear on the IRS website, but that's precisely what is happening. Potentially confusing errors are popping up on the site, including one that impacts taxpayers filing for an extension. Specifically, the extension payment date for taxpayers who log into the IRS website is incorrect. While payment should be made by April 15, 2025, taxpayers who log in to pay see an April 22, 2025, due date. The site says, "Your payment is due on April 22, 2025, regradless of filing for an extension." (Yes, the 'regradless' typo is on the IRS site, too). Multiple other errors appear on the site, including misidentifying the amended tax form as Form 104X (it's Form 1040X) that was recently “filled” instead of “filed.” The mistakes prompted Wendy Marsden, a CPA and author, to quip on BlueSky, “This is feeling like the website is spoofed and your payments will go straight to Russia.” It would be funny if it weren’t true. The timing raised eyebrows so close to Tax Day. It’s not clear when the changes were made—so far, there's been no answer. However, on Wednesday, Elon Musk tweeted on X (formerly Twitter) that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) had made a fix to the IRS website. Multiple tax professionals and some groups have reached out to the IRS. The IRS confirmed that it was investigating. As we look ahead to next week, here’s hoping it’s not quite so exciting. Don’t forget to file your return—or request an extension—by April 15, 2025. Check back with Forbes early next week for a list of deals and specials to make the day a little less taxing.

You can definitely pay your taxes with a credit card—either online or over the phone. But should you? That’s more complicated. I’m generally not a fan of replacing one kind of debt with another. But if your ability to pay is a timing issue—as opposed to an "I absolutely don’t have it at all" issue—it can make sense to use a credit card to pay off your tax debt. The IRS accepts all major credit cards (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or Visa). To make a payment, head over to the credit card payment page on the IRS website and choose one of the payment processors to pay online or by phone (if you're paying by credit card and using e-file, your options are here). The IRS doesn’t charge a fee for credit card payments. However, third-party credit and debit card providers may charge a fee, which may vary by provider, card type, and payment amount. Applicable fees for credit cards range from 1.75% to 2.95% (minimum fees apply)—that’s in addition to any fees or interest that your bank may charge. High-dollar payments—those over $1,000,000—must be coordinated with the service provider (you may also need a new tax preparer, just saying). Paying by credit card is a good option if you know you can pay the bill off eventually. Plus, you might earn miles or points to help you book a trip to somewhere amazing to lessen the pain of paying your taxes. That’s the plus side. On the not-so-plus side, credit card interest and other fees can add up, so if you know you won't be able to pay off the balance, consider other options, like an installment agreement with the IRS. An installment agreement lets you pay what you owe over time. Depending on how much you owe, you won’t even have to speak with a real person—if you owe $50,000 or less in combined individual income tax, penalties, and interest, you can apply for an installment agreement online. (If you don’t qualify for an online installment agreement or if you want to apply for an installment agreement by mail, use Form 9465.) Fees apply. Keep in mind that it's cheaper if you sign up online and even less expensive if you agree to pay by direct debit. Other options may be available, too. If you are insolvent or unable to pay due to circumstances beyond your control, the IRS will work with you. Give them a call at 1.800.829.1040 or use the phone number on any notice that you might have received in the mail. — Do you have a tax question or matter that you think we should cover in the next newsletter? We’d love to help if we can. Check out our guidelines and submit a question here. IRS numbers from the tenth week of the tax filing season—the week ending April 4, 2025—suggest that taxpayers are finally ready to file their tax returns. The data shows that the IRS received 101,422,000 individual income tax returns as of April 4, 2025, compared to 101,849,000 as of April 5, 2024. The dip is just .4%, with 427,000 fewer individual tax returns filed to date in 2025 compared to 2024. Most of those returns were e-filed. In 2025, the IRS received 98,184,000 e-filed returns, compared to 98,421,000 in 2024. That’s a drop of .2%. Of those, the IRS reported that it received 53,392,000 individual income returns e-filed by tax professionals and 44,792,000 self-prepared e-filed returns. Tax season data for week ending April 4, 2025 Most tax professionals will e-file your return—not only are some required to e-file (a 2010 requires specified tax return preparers to e-file certain federal income tax returns), the IRS says that e-filing is more secure and more likely to be accurate. As National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins put it when recommending e-filing: "Paper is the IRS' kryptonite." While a few weeks ago, the number of e-filed returns prepared by professionals was nearly neck and neck with the number of self-prepared e-filed returns, tax professionals now have the edge. Taxpayers with simple returns often e-file early, while those taxpayers with more complicated returns tend to rely on their tax professionals to file. The IRS began the e-file program in 1986 as a pilot project in three cities: Cincinnati (Ohio), Phoenix (Arizona), and Raleigh-Durham (N.C.). That year, there were 25,000 tax returns filed electronically. Last year, the IRS received 151,781,000 e-filed individual returns. Tariffs are already making an impact. Admit it: You haven’t heard about tariffs this much since freshman U.S. history. But with tariffs on again/off again this week, it’s all that many business owners were talking about. (You can find a quick primer on tariffs here.) One of the motivations behind the tariffs is revenue. Peter Navarro, a senior White House trade official, projected that tariffs announced since January would generate about $6 trillion to $7 trillion over 10 years. That would generate enough revenue to fund an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and some of Trump’s campaign promises, such as tax-free tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits. However, according to a new Tax Policy Center estimate, the tariffs will generate far less tax revenue than the administration claims. TPC estimates Trump’s taxes on imported goods would raise about $3.3 trillion from 2026 to 2035, plus an additional $190 billion for the remainder of 2025, roughly half of Navarro’s prediction. Of course, that was before the pause. That–and raising import taxes on Chinese goods–would cut in half the amount of revenue Trump’s April 2 levies could increase, according to a new TPC analysis. TPC found Trump’s latest plan would raise about $1.7 trillion for the 10 years from 2026 through 2035, plus an additional $125 billion for the remainder of 2025. The analysis assumed that Trump’s latest tariff policy would be permanent, although he said his newly announced delay would last only 90 days. It also assumed the President would eliminate his “reciprocal” import taxes but continue his 10% tariff on worldwide trade and maintain higher tariffs on many goods from Canada and Mexico and on products such as steel, aluminum, and autos and auto parts and raise tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%. Trump has suggested that the tariff revenue could replace income tax revenue. Earlier this year, he mused that the IRS could be replaced by the External Revenue Service, a new government agency that could be established to oversee the collection of tariff revenue. While abolishing the IRS and eliminating income taxes may sound good to some taxpayers, the practicality of fully replacing tax revenue with tariff revenue is very complex. And while most of the current tariffs–and revenue raisers–are focused on China, tariffs targeted to Canada have raised eyebrows. Trump has suggested that there’s an easy fix, writing on Truth Social, “The only thing that makes sense is for Canada to become our cherished Fifty First State. This would make all Tariffs, and everything else, totally disappear.” Those comments have rankled Canadian politicians, including Canada’s new prime minister, Mark Carney, who said, “The old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over. It’s clear the US is no longer a reliable partner.” And while it’s easy to dismiss the back and forth as political grandstanding, this isn’t the first time Americans have weaponized tariffs. In the late 19th century, President Benjamin Harrison’s secretary of state, James G. Blaine, had a plan: By saddling Canadian imports with heavy new tariffs, the United States could force Canada to seek American statehood. Will history repeat itself? (Spoiler alert: The 1890 tariffs didn’t result in Canada becoming what would have been, at the time, the 45th state.) 📅 April 15, 2025.

Who released an album titled “The IRS Tapes: Who’ll Buy My Memories?” to help pay off his tax debts? (A) Chuck Berry (B) Johnny Cash (C) Willie Nelson (D) Prince Find the answer at the bottom of this newsletter. The IRS may have your money. The tax agency says that more than $1 billion in outstanding refunds remain unclaimed from the 2021 tax year. The agency estimates that more than 1.1 million taxpayers might have qualified for a refund but did not file a federal income tax return to claim it—you have until April 15, 2025, to file and claim your money. The IRS reminds self-employed individuals, retirees, investors, businesses, and corporations that April 15 is the deadline for first-quarter estimated tax payments for the 2025 tax year. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) and Senator Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) commended the leadership of these two Senators on behalf of American businesses and employees through the introduction of the bipartisan Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2025. This bill provides uniformity for nonresident state and local income tax withholding and a reasonable de minimis exception from assessing state and local income tax in a jurisdiction where an employee does not reside. The IRS has published Internal Revenue Bulletins 2025-15 and 2025-16. Law firm Sullivan & Worcester announced that Cameron N. Cosby has joined the firm’s REITs and tax practices as a partner in the Washington, D.C., office. Previously with Fried Frank, Cosby brings over 35 years of experience with tax aspects related to real estate investment trusts (REITs), partnership transactions, and mergers and acquisitions. Remember last week when I wrote that Italy believed they could tax social media? Lawmakers in Minnesota think so, too. Key Minnesota Democrats on legislative tax committees want popular social media platforms to pay tax on the use of consumer data. Under the bill, large companies with more than one million users in the Gopher State would pay $165,000 per month plus $0.50 per person on the sites, while those with fewer than 100,000 users would not pay any tax (those in between would have varied rates). Facebook, owned by Meta, is considered to be the largest social media platform in the world—with over 3.049 billion monthly active users globally. YouTube is the second most used social media platform, with around 2.49 billion monthly active users. — If you have tax and accounting career or industry news, submit it for consideration here or email me directly.

LUCK, TX - MARCH 17: Willie Nelson performs in concert during Luck Reunion on March 17, 2022 in Luck, Texas. (Photo by Gary Miller/Getty Images for Shock Ink) In the 1980s, Nelson was hit with a staggering $16.7 million tax bill, thanks to his involvement in tax shelters. It was one of the largest individual federal income tax bills ever generated by the IRS at the time. The debt was negotiated to a mere $6 million by Nelson's lawyer, but Nelson still didn’t have the money to pay. On November 9, 1990, the feds raided Nelson's home, taking everything he owned except Trigger, Nelson's favorite guitar, which he had his daughter, Lana, take out of his home in anticipation of the raid. "As long as I got my guitar," Willie Nelson said, "I'll be fine." The IRS auctioned off some of Nelson’s belongings but didn't dent Nelson's bill. So, the two sides reached a rather unusual compromise: Nelson would release a compilation album and would share the proceeds with the IRS. The album, “The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?,” was entirely written by Nelson and performed using—what else?—Nelson's trusty guitar, Trigger. It was the first (and maybe only) record album ever released under a strict revenue-sharing agreement with the IRS. The album, which could be purchased by dialing (800) IRS-TAPE, retailed for $19.95. The IRS only collected $3.6 million from the sales of the album. However, by that time, Nelson had settled his lawsuit with Price Waterhouse (whom he had blamed for his tax woes in the first place), and with other projects in the works, Nelson paid off his debt. An IRS spokesperson said about the deal at the time, “We try to work with taxpayers… And if we have to come up with some creative payment plan, that's what we're going to do because it's in everyone's best interest.” How did we do?

Title: Big Tech cozied up to Trump — it’s not getting much in return

The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. The US has put Meta, Apple, Tesla, TikTok, and others in a tough spot. by Alex Heath For a while, it looked like President Donald Trump was going to have Big Tech’s back. Now, the tech industry is collateral damage in his global trade war. On Thursday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated the idea of placing “a levy on the advertising revenues of digital services” if tariff negotiations with the US go south. This would be the opposite outcome that tech CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg were hoping for when they threw their support behind the new administration. To someone like Zuckerberg, Trump was supposed to be the strong-armed leader to bring the overbearing EU to heel. Instead, the rhetoric between the US and EU is ratcheting up just weeks before the EU is already set to fine Meta (and Apple) for violating its Digital Markets Act. While certainly more of a self-inflicted wound, Elon Musk’s popularity in the US has “inverted as his support for President Trump has increased,” Nate Silver wrote this week. Tesla’s stock price, meanwhile. has lost over a third of its value this year, and, thanks to tariffs, the company has removed the option to buy new, US-made vehicles in China. As I predicted last week, TikTok is particularly screwed by Trump’s extra-aggressive China tariffs, which the country has promised to “fight to the end.” Even as it’s still business as usual for TikTok’s rank and file, the app’s fate in the US feels increasingly precarious. When asked this week about the extended deadline to reach a TikTok deal in the US, a spokesperson for China’s commerce ministry said the government “opposes practices that ignore the laws of the market economy, plunder by force, and damage the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises.” “There’s not going to be much dialogue until that’s resolved,” one of TikTok’s aspiring bidders, AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi, said this week of the tariffs. The situation is such a mess that the US stock market tanking also “drowned out the ability to infer feedback” from shareholders about AppLovin’s bid, Foroughi told Bloomberg. If anything, this week is a reminder that the tech industry has grown so large and influential that its leading companies are tools for leverage between countries. In times of relative peace, that influence can be beneficial for Big Tech. When things get hostile, Big Tech is put in the crosshairs.

We combed the internet to find more than a dozen Hoka deals on both women’s and men’s shoes—including designs that have earned spots in our sneaker shopping guides.

Whether you’re a walker, runner or simply looking for a comfortable and colorful pair of sneakers, these are the best Hoka deals happening now. Just keep in mind that some discouns only apply to a select color or two, and these deals tend to go fast—so if you’re eyeing a fresh pair, don’t delay. Hoka The Hoka Clifton 9 is one of our gear editors’ favorite shoes for both walking and long days of standing. You can score the women’s Clifton 9 for 20% off in nine colors on Hoka’s site right now. Or browse Dick’s Sporting Goods and REI if you’re looking for a different size and color combo—it’s on sale for the same discount at all three stores. Hoka Sturdy and springy, this sneaker was recently updated with a bouncy foam midsole and ultralight design that make it ideal for everyday runs. This discount is available at Hoka in four colorways and at Zappos in five. Hoka Inspired by southern California’s Solimar beach, this sleek sneaker offers neutral stability, mid-level cushioning and an extended heel—perfect for daily training. Three colors are currently on sale, though the colorway pictured above has the most sizing available. Hoka If you want a sneaker that can transition from the pavement to the trails, this Challenger design is on sale in six colors direct from Hoka. The redesigned sneaker offers more height than its previous iteration, a plush midsole and a grippy lug tread to keep you from slipping when you’re off-road. Hoka Designed with professionals in mind, the Hoka Bondi SR is for people who spend most of the day on their feet, like restraunt workers and nurses. The shoe features a plush sole, water-resistant leather and a slip-resistant outsole. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway, but sizes 7.5 through 11 are in stock. Hoka This unique slip-on is unisex. It has a stretchy, full-knit upper that lets you comfortably wear the sneaker without socks and plush cushioning for extra support. You can shop this discount in three colors, but the white design pictured above has the widest array of sizes. Hoka If you’re new to running, we think the Hoka Clifton 9 design is a great beginner-friendly option. Despite its plush build, the Clifton 9 is lighter than previous Clifton iterations and employs Hoka’s “meta rocker” sole for a smoother heel-to-toe transition. This option is on sale in 15 colorways at Hoka and 20 at Zappos. Hoka The Bondi 8’s cushioned sole and supportive design are great for flat feet and anyone who suffers from plantar fasciitis. It’s currently on sale in seven colors direct from Hoka, but the pictured colorway has the most available sizing. Two neutral colors are also on sale at Dick’s Sporting Goods.

Hoka Like the women’s version above, this all-terrain sneaker was designed for runners who want to seamlessly transition between the road and the trails. It’s designed with a breathable mesh upper and a sturdy lug sole to keep you stable and comfortable. Hoka currently has six colors discounted, but sizing is limited in some options. Hoka Perfect for post-gym recovery or hanging out by the pool, these ORA slides are on sale in three colors right now. The chunky sole has a plush top layer that hugs the foot and a moisture-wicking jersey strap that was recently updated for a better fit. Zappos The Kawana is a great transitional sneaker that you can wear at the gym or running errands. It has a low-profile aesthetic, a breathable mesh upper and an internal bootie for a more secure fit. This discount is only available in the pictured colorway but it’s the best price you can find for this sneaker online. Hoka rarely offers sitewide sales. That said, its sale section is often stocked with older designs for 20% to 40% off. You can also typically find deals on Hoka sneakers from third-party retailers like REI and Dick’s Sporting Goods. Yes, select Hoka styles have been awarded the podiatric APMA Seal of Acceptance. This means podiatrists have reviewed the shoes and agreed that a number of Hoka’s cushioned designs are beneficial to overall foot health. Our editors named the Hoka Clifton 9 sneaker the best cushioned walking shoe for women and the best men’s walking shoe for flat feet. The style is plush and supportive without feeling overly bulky. But they won’t work for everyone—the best walking shoe for you depends on a variety of factors, including how high your arches are and how you walk. For instance, we recommend skipping the Hoka Clifton 9 if you have especially narrow feet. The brand recommends replacing your Hokas between 250 and 500 miles, depending on individual wear. Pay attention to signs like increased muscle fatigue, uneven wear patterns and discomfort to identify when it’s time to trade in an older pair. Hokas have been popularized online for their outstanding comfort and support. They have a super-plush midsole that helps with shock absorption and stability without weighing you down. They also come in a variety of bright color combinations to suit most styles and preferences.
