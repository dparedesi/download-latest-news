Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alice Walton and Jim Walton at... (CC BY 2.0) by Walmart The richest family in the world is the Walton family, by a large margin. They are the descendants of Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) founder Sam Walton. Every year, Forbes and Bloomberg release a list of the richest families in the world. The estimates are easy for the wealth that is mostly held in public companies. Private company ownership and investments are harder to value accurately. Bloomberg puts the Walton figure at $513 billion across three generations. The second richest family is controlled by Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates, at $336 billion. The net worth of the Waltons is well below that of Elon Musk, who is the world’s richest person with a net worth of $632 billion. The Waltons and their foundations own 44% of Walmart, the world’s largest retailer. Walmart’s market cap is $922 billion, which makes it the 13th most valuable company in the world. Based on the math, the Waltons have other valuable holdings. For the most recent quarter, Walmart reported revenue of $180 billion, up 6% from the same quarter a year earlier. Earnings rose 35% to $0.77 per share. Walmart has 2.1 million employees around the world and more than 10,500 stores. The Waltons’ wealth increased over the past year. Walmart stock is up 21% over that period, compared to an 11% increase in the S&P 500. The Waltons are unusual among the mega-rich because they inherited their wealth. Most of the people at the top of the rich lists are founders or early employees. These include Elon Musk of Tesla, Larry Ellison of Oracle, Bill Gates of Microsoft, Jensen Huang of Nvidia, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Alphabet. And, of course, Warren Buffett. The Waltons did not have to work as hard as the tech founders to get mega-rich.

CNET’s top budget VR headset is now at a great low price, plus you’ll score a free $50 Amazon gift card with purchase. The Meta Quest 3S is on sale now. The holiday season is officially here, offering a prime opportunity to save on a wide range of technology. While it’s always smart to stock up on essentials during a sale, the real value lies in year‑end discounts on premium electronics. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest in the best virtual reality headset, these seasonal savings make right now the perfect time to buy. The Meta Quest 3S, already a fantastic value for the money, is on sale at Amazon. You can get the 128GB model or the 256GB model for up to $51 off, plus a $50 credit thrown in. New users also get one month of Xbox GamePass. At Amazon, the 128GB model is down to $250 with a $50 credit, effectively making it $200. The 256GB option includes Batman and is $50 off, bringing it down to $349. The Meta Quest 3S features an improved CPU and better graphics, making it a solid choice for gamers. It’s noticeably lighter than the previous Quest 2 and offers about three hours of battery life. This headset is the budget version of the Quest 3, but it’s similar to comparing an iPhone 17 to an iPhone 17 Pro -- the Pro has added benefits, but the standard version covers all the essentials without breaking a virtual sweat. Scott Stein, CNET’s VR expert, praised the headset in his review: “If you want a simple, fun entry ticket to VR at an amazing price, the Quest 3S is a really good upgraded device with a lot of headroom for mixed‑reality evolution in the years to come. And if you’re thinking of VR as a simple, fun everyday toy and you’re not wanting to spend too much, then the cheaper 3S is exactly where you want to be.” He also labeled it as “by far the best value in VR.” Virtual and augmented reality tech is constantly evolving, but it’s rarely cheap. Deals on headsets like the Meta Quest 3S don’t pop up every day. If you’ve been wanting to invest in one of Meta’s headsets, this is the time to buy while it’s available at a lower‑than‑usual price.

Transcripts may contain a few typos. With many episodes lasting 2+ hours, it can be difficult to catch minor errors. Enjoy! Tim Ferriss: Bill, great to see you, man. Bill Gurley: Good to see you. Tim Ferriss: And I thought we would start with a prop that you brought. So there was a very thick book with a tattered cover and I think that is as good a lead in as anything. And what are you holding? Bill Gurley: I’m holding a book called The Last Laugh by Phil Berger. The reason it’s tattered is I think it may be out of print, like I bought it used because I wanted to see it and have it. Tim Ferriss: What’s the subtitle? Bill Gurley: The Last Laugh: The World of the Stand-up Comics. Tim Ferriss: Why do you have this book? Are you thinking of making a career switch? Bill Gurley: No. No. No. No. So as part of researching my new book, Runnin’ Down a Dream, my co-writer and I were, we spent six years just diving through stories because I had done this speech at the University of Texas and we wanted to enhance it when we went to the printed form. And one of the stories we came across was Jerry Seinfeld and his decision to pursue a career as a comedian. And he was in New York. He wasn’t sure what he wanted to do with his life. He had an inkling, an inkling that he might want to be a standup comic, but he didn’t know what that meant. He didn’t know if it was a real career. He didn’t know that you could make money. And he read this book and it profiles, I don’t know, it looks like 15 different — it’s got Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, George Carlin, Lily Tomlin, Robert Klein. It profiled them in a way that was very disinhibiting to him. It gave him permission to go do this career that’s not a typical career. When you go to college, they don’t list standup comedian as something that you can go do. Tim Ferriss: The guidance counselor is not generally putting that on the multiple choice. Bill Gurley: Exactly. But this book served as something that granted him permission to go do that. Tim Ferriss: And we’re going to come back to that. I will say that I bookmarked this for future conversations, and of course we’re chatting outside of these recordings, but because two years ago, almost exactly when we did our first episode, you mentioned that you were working on a book idea based on the belief that it’s easier than ever to rise up because access to mentors and information is unprecedented. So we’ll come back to that, of course, and discuss it and the frameworks and the approaches and the stories at some length. But I wanted to start with some topical subject matter: AI bubble or not? And if so, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: Yeah. So I think this is super interesting. My partner, Peter, reminded me of a book that we had seen a while ago by Carlota Perez. It has this very benign title, Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital. It was written in like 2002. And what Perez simplifies and notices, which I just find perfect for trying to understand whether there’s a bubble or not, is that every time there’s been a technology wave that leads to wealth creation, especially fast wealth creation, that will inherently invite speculators, carpetbaggers, interlopers that want to come take advantage of it, think of the Gold Rush. And so people want to make it a debate. Do you believe in AI or is it a bubble? And if you say you think it’s a bubble, they say, “Oh, you don’t believe in AI.” Like, this “Got you!” kind of thing. And if you study Perez, and I think this is absolutely correct, if the wave is real, then you’re going to have bubble-like behavior. They come together as a pair, precisely because any time there’s very quick wealth creation, you’re going to get a lot of people that want to come try and take advantage of that or participate in it. So you get a flood of those types of people coming at it. And so it’s odd. There’s a real technology wave that’s fundamentally changing the world and there’s also massive speculation simultaneously. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they come as a pair. I recall not too long ago, maybe two weeks ago, saw a short interview with your friend, Jeff Bezos, and he distinguished between financial bubbles and industrial bubbles and cited, and I’m paraphrasing here, but 2008 as an example of a bad bubble, financial bubble, versus, let’s just say, the early 2000s, ’98, ’99, 2000, where a lot of very important technology was created that then was durable after the fact and created new generations of entrepreneurs and a lot of economic growth. And he believes that AI would fall into the industrial bubble category of things. But I suppose, given that the dancing pair you described come together, how would you think about investing in private companies, modern venture capital at this point in time? And just, I suppose, as it’s changed since you were most active. Bill Gurley: Just a quick comment on that industrial bubble thing. One thing that is surprising to me is that even though I fundamentally believe this is an important real technology wave, the big players, even the Mag Seven, have all decided to do things from a deal perspective. You’ve read about these circular deals and whatnot. Tim Ferriss: Could you explain what you mean by that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a lot of talk out there, but it all started when Microsoft invested in OpenAI. OpenAI agreed to buy services from Microsoft, which is called a circular deal because you’re giving them money they wouldn’t have otherwise. And when Dario was on stage at DealBook last week, he said, “Oh, I can explain this. It’s not that hard.” Amazon wanted us to spend money we didn’t have, so they gave us even more money. And I’m like, “Well, that’s precisely why this is a questionable behavior.” But it’s gotten bigger. NVIDIA’s handed out money and then NVIDIA gave CoreWeave money, but then also agreed to buy any services they have left over. This stuff’s not ideal. Like if you were to say, “What’s crisp, clean accounting?” You wouldn’t do these things. And some of them say, “Well, it’s not material.” And which I would say, “Well, then why are you doing it?” And I’ve asked other people to try and understand how even big, sophisticated companies might get speculative using a word from previous discussion. And I hear things like, “Well, loss aversion tends to go down when you’re winning.” Like if you’re on a hot streak in a casino, you take more risk, things like that. But it is surprising to me. So when it comes to retail investors, I would be particularly concerned for them at this stage in the AI game because there is a plethora of SPV vehicles, but you’ve heard that phrase, I’m sure, SPV. This is where someone has an in on an investment and they do a one-off VC fund, if you will. Tim Ferriss: A special purpose vehicle. Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s a single entity just for that one — Tim Ferriss: We have a chance to invest in X. We have an allocation of however much money, and then they can allow Jane Doe and John Doe potentially — Bill Gurley: And they take a rake on it. And there’s people promoting SPVs in situations where they don’t even actually have the underlying stock, or maybe they hope to get it. It’s the wild, wild west. And most of the people on that edge, I would put in the category of interloper carpet bagger. These are people that have come to this thing, and I just think you got to be quite careful. The investments that were made that have already had 100 X plus returns were made a while ago before this thing started. And that’s not to say there won’t be an incremental AI investment that makes money, I think there will, but your odds right now of that being the case are really, really low. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I would add to that and say, and this applies to me as much as anyone else, but your actual risk tolerance may differ, probably does differ significantly from your perceived risk tolerance if you haven’t had a huge drawdown, right? If you haven’t actually ridden a few of those waves and see how you respond in those circumstances, and you should be, I suppose, skeptical of how you view your own intestinal fortitude with some of those things, or maybe the losses you can absorb. Because I recall, for instance, I’ve seen this many, many times, but with these types of SPVs, people get involved, and let’s just say they’re not typically an angel investor, they don’t have the experience of watching 60%, 70%, 80% of their investments go to zero or become the walking dead, and they sign off on all of the, not necessarily waivers, but they accept, accept, accept the SBV terms of service, which I’ll say, “You could lose all of your investment. This is incredibly risky.” But then when it does go to zero, the financial and psychological impact is catastrophic. Bill Gurley: There’s a lot of people, and I think this comes from a very good place. I think they’re very well intentioned who look at the world and say — well, first of all, rising inequality, why can’t everyone have access to the same things? And then companies are staying private longer. So they say, we need to institutionalize the generic public’s ability to invest in private companies. And the problem, I think there’s two problems. One you just hinted at, which is most private company VC backed even go to zero, like the majority, which is not something people really — they sense that they want the lottery ticket, they want the Uber, they want the one that goes to the moon, but they don’t understand that that comes along with it. Tim Ferriss: They don’t want to buy losing lottery tickets for 12 years. Bill Gurley: Right. Right. Exactly. And the second problem is the information transparency in the private company game is just low. And I think the institutional investors have come to understand that and know what they’re getting into and know how to evaluate things. But if you come at it with a public market mindset thinking, “Oh, every set of financials I’ve been handed is audited and is correct.” And that’s just not the case. It’s super loosey-goosey. Tim Ferriss: So if you were, this may be a difficult question, but if you were angel investing right now, how would you be thinking about your approach? Bill Gurley: I’ll tell you a funny story. When I decided to hang up my gloves, if you will, and stop making institutional venture capital investments, I had a whole bunch of ideas about what I wanted to do next. And one of them was, “Oh, I’ll do a bunch of angel investing.” Bezos did it on the side. This would be fantastic. Tim Ferriss: He did pretty well with his angel investing. Bill Gurley: I was explaining this to a, I won’t say who it is, but a Silicon Valley CEO, very successful. And he said, “What are you going to do now?” And I said, “I was thinking of doing angel investing.” He goes, “Why would you do that?” He said, “I got 50 of these things. People don’t return my calls.” He goes, “I wish I’d never done it.” So there’s a unglamorous side to it as much as there is a glamorous side. And you’ve participated in this world before. So what would I say? I think if I were doing angel investments, I’d try and find in an intersection of people that are super curious and are playing with all these AI tools, but bring a perspective from a particular industry that gives them an advantage in that area where they could simultaneously be maybe the smartest user of AI in their genre, in their vertical. Tim Ferriss: So despite the, or maybe because of, because we talked about the pair, the AI bubble, you would still be looking at AI intersected opportunities if you were angel investing. Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a weird reality out there right now, and this could end if ever a bubble has popped or whatever, but the institutional investors have zero interest in non-AI deals. Zero. It’s more black and white than I could be successful in — Tim Ferriss: And for people who do not know the term, define the institutional investor. Bill Gurley: People who are paid both a salary and a piece of the return to be active investors of other people’s money, using other people’s money. But the reason that kind of matters is if you angel fund a deal and have any hope of it raising money in the future, if it’s not AI related, right now — Tim Ferriss: Could die of neglect. Bill Gurley: There is no interest. I can’t state clearly enough how there’s zero interest. And I could simultaneously make fun of that reality, but I could also justify that reality, but it is the reality right now. And by the way, while I mention that, I feel obligated for your audience. I don’t care what field you’re in, you should be playing with this stuff. It has the potential to impact your role in your career, and the best way to protect against any risk of your career being obfuscated or eliminated from AI is to be the most AI-enabled version of yourself you can possibly be. PREROLL Tim Ferriss: How would you think about, maybe you can give a hypothetical example of looking for someone who has very, very sophisticated domain expertise and experience who’s now intersecting with AI and has a unique, because of the combination perspective on things, to invest in as an angel investor and separate that from something that’s just going to be consumed by the fundamental models and these larger companies that — Bill Gurley: From a career perspective or — Tim Ferriss: From an angel investment perspective, how would you pick folks you don’t think are just going to end up working on something that gets replicated in short order by the bigger companies? Bill Gurley: Yeah. The key is just to stay pretty far away from the edge of whatever. You can go online and see interviews with the people at Anthropic or OpenAI and what they’re working on. If it’s the next thing they’re going to do, I don’t think you’re going to be protected. But as I think about founders and angel investors, you’re talking about a pretty broad array of things. At this point, as I mentioned earlier, you’re not going to back the next big model company. Besides, if you were, you need a billion dollar angel investment to go make that happen. It’s just really, the game’s changed. There’s so much money involved. And so I think you’re going to want to be off the beaten path anyway. When I think about these deeper verticals, I don’t think it will make sense for OpenAI to go crush every little vertical. Tim Ferriss: Waste management. Bill Gurley: And even if the model’s capable of understanding that subject matter, there are workflows, there are data sets that are local to your customer, and that stuff has to be stitched together. So I think having an understanding of a particular industry and one that’s not going to be on the next thing to do list at OpenAI, it would probably be your best bet. Tim Ferriss: Got it. So is it fair to say, if I’m understanding you correctly, that effectively looking for something that would not be a high priority for one of these larger companies and also a proprietary dataset of some type? Bill Gurley: Proprietary datasets, the more workflows that exist are better because you can build software around those things that — Tim Ferriss: What is a workflow? Bill Gurley: The thing that popped into my head, I’m on the board of Zillow. Zillow’s been investing for the past five years in tools that help the realtor do their day-to-day job. They have a tool called Showing Time that helps you book in person tours at houses as an example, but there’s putting the mortgage together, getting the sign-offs on. There’s just all these tasks that have to be happened that can be automated in the — And so tasks that can be automated, that can be integrated with AI, the more of that stuff you can build into a system, the better off you’re going to be protecting yourself from a model that just answers questions, which is why I brought it up. Tim Ferriss: All right. Let’s move on to big topic, big country, China. You spent 10 days there over the past summer. What was your experience? What did you see? What made an impression? What did you do? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I’d been about six times before, so this is like my seventh trip. It was one thing that was different. My daughter is an Asian studies major, as you were, and she spent the summer in Hong Kong. So we picked her up and then we toured six cities in 10 days. And my objective with this trip, in the past trips, it was mostly just to meet with entrepreneurs and founders and mutual sharing of information, that thing. This time I was more interested in just kind of being eyes wide open and learning. And so we took two of the high speed trains just as an experience that I got a tour of the Xiaomi factory with their new car, the SU7, and was trying to get a feel for what’s most recent there. And we went to Shenzhen, the overnight city, which has gone from, I think, less than 100,000 people in 1980 to 20 million people. And just to see the scale and scope of the whole thing, there’s a lot of rhetoric in the US about what is or isn’t happening in China. And I just wanted to have a better feel for it. And we’re making policy decisions that are going to impact the global footprint, and God forbid, end up in a World War three situation. So anyway, I just wanted a better understanding. I was aided by the fact that Dan Wang shared his book Breakneck with me right before I left, and I read it while I was there, which was interesting. And then it came out, and of course it ended up on the bestseller list. But I think China’s misperceived in a lot of ways. Tim Ferriss: What are some of those misperceptions? Bill Gurley: The biggest one is that people who have a rudimentary understanding of what is happening there, you use this word communism to infer a lot of other things. And one of the things that’s inferred by communism is top down state run system. And I think they think of Russia and they assume, “Well, that’ll always lead to bad capital allocation, no innovation.” Because they have this picture in their mind of these, I don’t know, brick buildings, like with snow all around them and not much happening. And the reality there is just far, far different from that. I think Dan Wang did a great job of explaining how the country puts out this five-year plan, but then the provinces, which they’re a lot bigger than a US state, but they’re the equivalent, like it’s how the country segment and they compete with each other. And the effective mayor of the province, if he does well, has a chance to move up in the system, which is not a reality in the US system. But what that leads to is just a massive amount of competition and — Tim Ferriss: What are the metrics by which they’re being judged? Do you have any idea on a province level? Is it some equivalent of GDP? It’s not the right term, but — Bill Gurley: I’m guessing probably we could go talk to AI and get a better answer than I have right now. But yeah, I would think that’s part of it, prosperity, employment, those things. By the way, this provincial competition has also led to overbuild of buildings. It’s not always positive, bridges that aren’t used, there’s a Go cities. Go cities, yes. But you end up with hyper competition. So I think the thing that a lot of people in Silicon Valley love about capitalism is this notion of the invisible hand and competition that leads to innovation and best practice, and the winners rise up and they’re better for it. That is happening there. And if you read about the solar industry or the EV industry or now the robotics industry, they have hundreds of different companies competing in these fields and it’s brutal competition. And as a result of that, they’re ending up with very innovative companies, which once again, I think people wouldn’t prescribe to being possible in a communist world and remarkable execution from an industrial standpoint. So the price points of the products that will be sold around the globe are well below anything that could be done in the US. Tim Ferriss: How do you go about getting a tour of Xiaomi factory? I would think that they would be very closed about that. What’s in it for them and how do they — Bill Gurley: I don’t know if you saw this going around the internet yesterday, but they shipped a car to this YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. I saw it. Yeah. Absolutely. Bill Gurley: Which is brilliant. And he did like a 15 — that’s the SG7, that’s the factory I went to. As I mentioned, I’d been there before, so I met Lei Jun, who’s the Founder of Xiaomi in 2005 when he was chairman of Joyo, which was a E-commerce company that Amazon bought. So he’s been around a while. He has evolved into, the best thing I could say is he’s the Steve Jobs of China right now. When he quit doing Joyo and he had this other company as well, he declared 10 years ago he was going to build a smartphone. Just out of the blue, I’m going to build a smartphone. He didn’t have any smartphone experience, but Xiaomi’s now the third-largest manufacturer of handsets in the globe. And about four or five years ago, at about the exact same time Apple hinted they were interested in building a car, he said, “I’m going to build a car.” Tim Ferriss: Well, not only did he say I’m going to build a car, but that was a response to sanctions. That was an emergency. Well, I listened to the translation of, even though my Chinese is decent, but it’s not as good as it once was. I think it was 2024 company-wide address where he talked about the sanctions coming in saying, “What if we couldn’t make phones? What would we do? Bill Gurley: But that talk is unbelievable, and it’s translated on YouTube, and I would encourage people to watch from about minute 30 to about an hour 15, which is where he talks about his process for designing the car. I don’t know if you saw that part. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I did. Bill Gurley: But it’s crazy. He says, he put a note on any car in his parking lot that he had never drove, and he would ask each employee to give him three positives, three negatives and loan them the car. Said he drove 200 of his employees cars. When you hear that stuff, you’re like, “Wow, I wonder if anyone at Apple did that.” It’s just such a bottom up, just ground truth way to start the process. But even still, even if he did that, a bunch of people could do that. How do you have the wherewithal to build a factory? He’d never built a factory before. And I’ve been in other car factories here in the US. It was phenomenal. Anyway, back to your question why I could get in. I knew Lei Jun from way back when. Tim Ferriss: What does the process look like? Are there a bunch of clearances and you have to get the okay from the provincial? Bill Gurley: I don’t think we went through the whole factory, but no, it wasn’t that. They’re a public company. I think they’re interested in being well understood, which I think hints at why they enabled this. I think they had to send a car to this guy, the YouTuber. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: And by the way, the President of Ford went over there about six months before I did, went on the same tour, so they let him go there. And he had an SU7 shipped to Michigan, and he drove it for several weeks and he’s talked about how incredible it is. Tim Ferriss: Well, he also, if I’m remembering correctly, has talked about EV production, and battery dominance or at least component dominance from China and the risks inherent in that. And I don’t want to bleed too far into geopolitics, but it’s hard not to pull it into the conversation. So this is a question from X, the artist formerly known as Twitter, one of many questions. But I’ll ask, what are your top handful of critiques say of the Chinese tech ecosystem or CCP after going on a tour there? What would you say they’re not doing well or things that complicate their ability to compete? Bill Gurley: Well, the first one that’s I think been well publicized is when an entrepreneur has risen to a level of success and then uses that as a platform, the government seems uninterested in that. Tim Ferriss: Exhibit A. Bill Gurley: The Jack Ma. Tim Ferriss: Jack Ma. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. And there’s a saying that I think I heard while I was over there, “Don’t be the tallest tree.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah, this is, Don’t Be The Tallest Tree. Yeah, the nail that sticks out gets hammered down in Japan. They have a totally different system obviously. Bill Gurley: The other entrepreneur outside of Lei Jun is the ByteDance CEO. And ByteDance is probably got the leading position for the consumer AI, like Open AI, but over there right now, in addition to just incredible revenue growth. This is the company that owned TikTok and whatnot, but they’re not going public and you don’t see him at all, which may get to this tallest tree thing. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, celebrities also disappear over there. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: Very mysteriously. Bill Gurley: Yes. Well, and business people. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: So yes, that does happen. Tim Ferriss: I will say, and for people who are wondering, because there are a lot of — how should we put this? There are people who are very angry, very hawkish. Some people are very, very supportive, and then their agendas or alliances get questioned. I, like you, I’m just interested in understanding what is happening to the extent that I can. What is the actual truth on the ground? What are the details? And frankly, the innovation over there is remarkable. And what they’ve done in terms of establishing access to rare metals and everything they need to manufacture is remarkable. You go to South America or Africa, and it is Chinese everywhere on infrastructure projects. They’ve been very, very smart about it. So I’m deeply interested in all of it, and please hold your thought because I want to hear everything you have to say. What I would say is a piece of the three-dimensional chess that I’ve been impressed with is how well the Chinese government is able to — well, of course they’re able to integrate with the private sector so that they’re able to use, in a sense, products to widen their scope of access potentially. Like DJI, for instance, great example. People have a lot of questions around these cars, as spectacular as they might be. Are they an extension of surveillance? These are open questions that I think are worth asking. But you were about to say something, so I’ll let you — Bill Gurley: No, no, no. I think let’s come to that. Let me make one point and then let’s come to that. So there’s two other things I wanted to mention. Obviously, infrastructure. So they are building new nuclear fission plants. So fission being old school, not new school, at one fourth the price that we do it here in the US. So is South Korea, by the way. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. And the numbers are incredible. Bill Gurley: But when we sit here and say, “Oh, we want to re-shore manufacturing, and they can build things at one fourth the price we can.” If you don’t solve that, you’re going to re-shore something and we’re going to not be price competitive globally. And then because you won’t import what they have, and you’re going to make our citizens buy from this new factory where we’re making things way more expensive, it doesn’t work. Tim Ferriss: The math doesn’t math. Bill Gurley: It doesn’t work. And by the way, I’m not sure it brings jobs. The Xiaomi factory was a third based on some numbers I was able to acquire, a third the number of employees per car output. And I got to believe in 10 years it’ll be a sixth. And so you could calculate the total number of jobs that you’d be bringing back if you brought back all this car production and it’d be hundreds of thousands. It’s not millions and millions of jobs. So anyway, that infrastructure thing’s for real. And I think Dan Wong does a good job of saying that America’s run by lawyers. Tim Ferriss: And this is the author of Breakneck. Bill Gurley: Our country’s run by lawyers and theirs is run by engineers. Engineers. And so when you try and build something here, the lawyers just get in the way and try and block it, which certainly when you hear Elon talks about why the Gigafactory is here in Austin and not in California, it all relates to those things. So anyway, that’s infrastructure. There’s another thing that’s I think quite interesting, which is the government may not care about whether or not their companies have really big market caps. And when I first realized this, you saw what happened when they took down Alibaba when they went after Jack Ma, and Amp Financial could have been this big thing and it got a haircut, and you question, well, do they care? And if you are pushing your companies to be low cost providers, maybe that’s at odds with them being hyper profitable and really big. And then you can turn around and ask the question. Hearing that caused me to ask the question, does America really benefit by the fact that the Mag Seven have $3 trillion market caps? I know the employees of those companies do, but is that a sign of our competitive capitalistic society not being truly competitive? Tim Ferriss: On a global scale. Bill Gurley: No, even within. There’s a notion you learn about in economics classes called pure competition. And in pure competition, no one has an intellectual property advantage. Marginal profits are whittled down just to the cost of capital, and the consumer benefits because there’s no excessive profit capture. If we have all these companies that are able to have excessive profits, is that a form of market failure? And does the fact that they exist help America in any way? At first, of course I’m a venture capitalist. I want to think, yes, of course. But then as I think about it, I don’t know that our government, or our society, or our people are better off because these six companies have $3 trillion market caps. It’s not that many people that — the percentage of the country that’s employed by those companies is small on an overall basis. And so anyway, I think they have a different perspective on whether big market caps matter, and I think that is somewhat intriguing. Tim Ferriss: What do you think about the innovation in China leading in some cases to the development of superior technology at a lower cost, that is plausibly an extension of the intelligence gathering apparatus of the government? Is that a real thing? Bill Gurley: I’m not in a good place to know. Tim Ferriss: I would have to imagine it seems like they would have to be stupid not to use that given their ability to penetrate the private sector. Bill Gurley: Yeah. I think it’s certainly well known that they do surveillance of their own people. I know that would be particularly upsetting to people like Greg Luciano that runs FIRE and is very interested in free speech. The flip side is there’s very little street crime. You walk around, you don’t worry about that when you’re there. Tim Ferriss: It’s true also in Japan though, right? Bill Gurley: It doesn’t make it right or wrong. It is what it is. And I don’t know that we have this ability to tell them how they have to do it. Now, to the extent that the Huawei stuff where their products are being shipped out, and then those are used to gather intelligence out of their country and the rest of the world, of course that’s a problem. But I think the way to deal with it, I’m not a politician, but I think the way to deal with it — I’m more of a believer of the engage. Engage, talk about what you don’t like and what you do like, and try and negotiate that problem away like we’re trying to do with the fentanyl precursors. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Well, way back in the day when I was an East Asian studies major, this was lifetimes ago. And keeping in mind, I was at the Capitol University of Business Economics in 1996. That was the bicycle era, these old photographs of Beijing with millions of bicycles with people in their long green jackets. I had one of those jackets for the winters. It gets really cold. But things have changed a lot. At the time, I was looking forward and thinking I might be one of those people who could engage in Chinese. I think the way to do it is in English, frankly, for a whole host of reasons. But even if you speak the other language, Putin speaks English pretty well, but he does all of his negotiations when he’s speaking in Russian for a lot of good reasons, the same good reasons. Bill Gurley: I get that. But look, so first of all, I do get accused of being like an agent of the CCP or something, even by some of the people that responded to your Twitter thing. I’m not. I’ve only visited a few times. I don’t know anybody in the government, but I worry greatly that we make bad policy decisions if we misunderstand what’s really going on. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I agree with that. Yeah, I fully agree with that. I’ve thought about — I frankly am worried about it. I would take a burner phone and a burner laptop. I’ve thought about it, because I want to get a better understanding of the culture of innovation that can be fostered, and exactly how things are to the extent that it would be visible to me, how things are developing in China. I’ve thought about going there. I thought about doing the same thing in India, too, to go and interview 10 of the top entrepreneurs. But the reason I haven’t done it is that I’m just like, I don’t know what radars that’s going to put me on, what surveillance, what fill in the blank, how difficult is it going to be? Whose rings am I going to have to kiss? Am I overthinking it or is it straightforward? Bill Gurley: I think you’re overthinking it. I think the odds that Tim Ferriss would disappear in China is really [inaudible 00:44:26]. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I’m not worried about disappearing. That would be a terrible — the upside downside on that doesn’t make any sense. I’m not worried about disappearing. Bill Gurley: There are companies that may not speak with you. When I was there, DeepSeek and Unitree, the word was out on the street that they’re not meeting with Westerners for reasons that are — Tim Ferriss: Well, I’m sure that’s true conversely in the US too, right? Bill Gurley: Yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I’m sure that’s — and by the way, I think that reflective lens, when you think about the country is helpful. When Alex Karp was just on stage at DealBook last week, he was talking about surveillance and he says, “Well, of course our tools are used to surveil the enemy.” And I’m like, “Okay, well, my God, the Chinese are surveilling us, but obviously we’re surveilling them too. Let’s be honest about these things.” Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It’s a lot easier for a bunch of obvious reasons. It’s in some respects, a lot easier for them to surveil us than the other way around. Partially just due to the homogeneity of the society over there. You can’t send a bunch of blonde-haired, blue eyes, black, Latino, whatever, to China to end up at top universities, top companies, et cetera. It’s just a lot harder. Bill Gurley: By the way, to put a bow on this part, I would say there’s two other things. One, you hinted at. One, the supply chains are so integrated in China down to the raw material level, that even if you brought a factory back here, it’d be more of an assembly shop and you’d still be sourcing from there, which isn’t necessarily cost competitive. And to replicate all of it would take a very, very, very long time. Tim Ferriss: Well, including raw materials for staple pharmaceuticals, There’s a lot going on. So what at this point, is it a day late and a dollar short for the US? I know I almost promised we weren’t going to go into this, but I want to know your opinion. I’m so curious. What are the keys to the US remaining globally competitive and vibrant as an economy? You hinted to one, which is, it seems inevitable, nuclear power or more power. So how do you do that? I’m not sure how quickly you can right the ship, although it seems like a handful of people have done a pretty good job of changing the narrative. What are some of the key things in your opinion that the US needs to do? Bill Gurley: One is make it easier to build. Tim Ferriss: Build companies? Build? Bill Gurley: I think build infrastructure. If you’re going to build semiconductor plants, if you’re going to build nuclear plants on time and on budget, that’s very hard to do in the US right now. And the glimmer of hope I would say is that a few states seem to have governors that want to get stuff out of the way. And I think it’s red tape and bureaucracy, and lawyers, and litigation that make this stuff so expensive. And so Texas and Arizona seem to be getting their unfair share of data centers and semiconductor plants. And I think because of that attitude, I’ve seen a similar attitude in Pennsylvania where they repaired I-95 in 12 days, but they literally had to take a bunch of statutes that are on the books and say that they don’t apply right now. So that mindset I think needs a lot more momentum. That’d be one thing. There’s another thing that I think is important for people to understand on the China front. There are numerous people with a loud microphone that will say, “Oh, they know how to scale out plants, but they don’t know how to do any innovation.” And that’s just flat wrong. Whoever’s saying that just hasn’t been there. They don’t know the facts on the ground. These entrepreneurs are every bit as good as the entrepreneurs they are here. There are examples like in LIDAR, they built a MEMS LiDAR product that’s like $130 a car. Tim Ferriss: What is MEMS LiDAR? Bill Gurley: It’s solid state. It uses solid state semiconductor technology instead of that big spinning radar. And so the LiDAR on a Waymo is $5,000. And it’s $130 for MEMS LIDAR. They’re putting it on every car. You can go into ChatGPT and say, “Tell me about MEMS LiDAR innovation in China.” But it’s a great example. Le Jun’s another one, but anybody that thinks there’s no innovation is just — Tim Ferriss: Yeah, they’re just wrong. Bill Gurley: They got blinders on. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. No, that’s not true. That’s definitely not true. I asked you two years ago if there are any countries that you’re long on. At the time, I’d be curious if this is still the case. You said you’re long on the UK, less regulatory capture. Bill Gurley: Did I say that? Tim Ferriss: Losing party pay is in the legal system. Bill Gurley: I do love that. Tim Ferriss: Which reduces frivolous litigation compared to the US. Any thoughts on where you’re bullish these days? Bill Gurley: Well, ironically, Matt Ridley was in town a few weeks ago in Austin. Tim Ferriss: The Rational Optimist, other books. Bill Gurley: I love his stuff, but he would say that I would be dead wrong on that. Things aren’t going well there. And he lives there. So I’ll just take that as I got that one wrong. Tim Ferriss: Well, it depends on the timeframe too. Is it two years, or is it five years or is it 10 years? Bill Gurley: One of the things that’s been impressive about China is since Deng Xiaoping brought back capitalism, 500 million people have come out of poverty. And you look at countries that have a very strong work ethic, and a high education, and a currently low per populate income, and you would think more jobs would come their way. So two that would pop for me are Vietnam and Turkey, who check all those boxes. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: Hopefully I do better then. Tim Ferriss: Check in in another two years. All right. So let’s talk about, this is going to be a segue to talking about Runnin’ Down a Dream and all things involved with that. Maybe we could start with an anecdote from a fellow Austinite, likes to play the bongos, long hair, associated with smoking reefer every once in a while. Matthew, we were talking about a short anecdote about Matthew before we started recording. Would you mind sharing that? Bill Gurley: Yeah. As I was preparing, as I was wrapping up the book, I started listening to Greenlights, and I was told you had to listen to it because of course he reads it. So you get all the great McConaughey affectations as you read it. But there’s a story in it that just popped in my brain and summarized exactly what I’m trying to accomplish with this book, Runnin’ Down a Dream. And he had spent the vast majority of his young adult life—so this anecdote is from when he was like 20, 21—telling his family he was going to be a lawyer. And so he’d gotten into the University of Texas. He was Pre-Law. Every time he went home, he talked about, “Yeah, I’m going to be a lawyer.” And he had met some people at Texas that had convinced him that he should switch to film school. And he had immense anxiety about sharing this with his father. This is all in the book, but his father’s a very tough individual. And so reason to be fearful when you’re going to drop some news. “I’m no longer going to be a lawyer. I’m going to go to film school.” And he builds it up a lot in the book. I didn’t know when I was going to talk to him. You can imagine being in that situation, you’re delaying, delaying, delaying. But he finally tells his dad and his dad utters this very simple phrase, “Well, don’t half ass it.” And he says, “Of all the reactions he could have had, don’t half ass it were the last words I expected to hear and the best words he could have ever said to me.” And he said in that single moment, he gave him blessing, consent, approval, validation, privilege, honor, freedom, and responsibility, called it rocket fuel. And I’d like to believe there are a number of people out there, young adults, maybe even some midlife career who have this notion that they should be doing something else, but society has put them on a path, or just the way they matriculated through college, put them into a career that they just don’t love and that they have this inkling that they could go do this thing. Or maybe you’re a young kid and you really want to do X, but everybody else is telling you to do A, B and C. I want to help them have the confidence and permission to go do X, to go chase this dream. And as you hinted at from our last call, I think the amount of your ability to make connections and to gather information and learn on your own pace, has never been better. You can literally just sit there and talk to ChatGPT six hours a day if you so choose, and learn so much about any particular field. And so your ability to take things into your own hands, and to go try and be successful in this thing that you feel passionate about, I think has never been better. Tim Ferriss: Why do you think when you initially gave and subsequently had to go online, Runnin’ Down a Dream as a presentation, why do you think that took? Why did it strike a chord in the way that it did? What do you think it was? Bill Gurley: Well, I think we’ve built a society, like nobody’s fault. We just have built a society where we love to celebrate people that are successful in a lot of different fields, but when it comes to our own children, we tend to think way more pragmatically about what they should be doing. Lawyers, consultants, doctors, computer scientists, it’s all these jobs that have certainty to the financial component. And I think that’s so well intended. I don’t think there’s mal intent of anyone in the system. And I’m a parent of three, I’ve been through this. You just feel this obligation to try and push them towards prosperity, but it’s not intellectual prosperity, it’s not happiness, it’s financial. Tim Ferriss: Stability. Bill Gurley: Yes, that most people are guiding children towards. And this isn’t that complicated math, but most people end up working 80,000 hours in their life. It’s a third of your life. Why do something you don’t like? There’s Gallup poll data on career engagement and 59% of people say they’re not engaged at work. And this is that whole quiet quitting thing that we hear so much about. And some of these numbers are at an all-time low. It just seems horrific that people are sauntering through life. Tim Ferriss: So what are some of the keys to taking the path less traveled then in this case? And there are a few I highlighted for myself, but where should we start? I highlighted one for myself. We don’t have to start here, but go where the action is. I just think this is so underrated, and people further undervalue it maybe in a digital world, but we can start anywhere you want. That’s just one that really jumped out to me because I think it’s really underrated. But where would you like to start? Bill Gurley: I think in the book, one of the things that we tie together very early on is the interplay between passion, or fascination, or curiosity and learning. And the way to be most successful in any endeavor, but certainly if you’re going to go tilt it something that’s less pragmatic, is to be the smartest, most knowledgeable person you can possibly be. And knowledge is free now, as we’ve talked about. And I have this test for whether or not you’re actually truly passionate about what you’re trying to do, which is do you self-learn on your own time? Would you not watch Breaking Bad and read about this field and be energized by that activity? If you are, and we have 20, 30 different stories in the book of people that have been successful, almost all of them check that box. You just have this amazing ability to gain knowledge so much faster than everyone else you would be competing with. And that’s going to be useful. That’s unquestionably going to be useful. Tim Ferriss: I mean, it makes me think of an interview I saw a long time ago, actually. It was quite a few years ago, but it was an interview with Joe Rogan and he said something that surprised me, it might surprise a lot of people, which was along the lines of he’s not good at, it was either willpower or discipline, which he’s in great shape. Obviously he’s black belt in jujitsu. He’s done what he’s done with the podcast. He’s the undisputed king of podcasting, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. And he said, “I’m not actually good at whether it was discipline or willpower, but I am good at obsession. It’s all on or all off.” And I’ve seen that, I’m sure you’ve seen this in a lot of the entrepreneurs who actually make it to the other side and create these mega successes, they are just obsessed. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: And that gives them a huge, not just knowledge advantage, but endurance advantage. You just go down the checkboxes. It’s all advantages, and — Bill Gurley: I had the opportunity to talk to Angela Duckworth when I was working on this and her book, Grit, talks about two components, passion and perseverance. And I heard a podcast she had done recently where she said if she could go back, she would put far more weight on the passion and the perseverance because she says, “We’ve taught our children to grind.” And so once again, starting in sixth grade, they’re told to learn the flute and take lacrosse and do all this stuff and crush the SATs and take the extra credit classes and all this. And they all do it and they all do it. And then they go to college and, “Oh, how are you doing?” They take six hours of class instead of four and they’re just going. But eventually she says, “If you don’t have that passion, you just burn out.” And so you’re right about the energy part. I think it’s both knowledge and you’ve put in more cycles. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. It makes me think of, maybe this is cliched in Silicon Valley because it gets so oft repeated, but a lot of folks listening will not have heard it, which is if you’re looking for the next technological breakthrough or something on the edge, look for what the nerds are doing on the weekends. But it’s not just a great way to find what might be coming around the corner in a few years. It’s a great way to find the people to bet on who are already using their excess, their free time to work on these things. Bill Gurley: No doubt. Tim Ferriss: I think of [inaudible 01:01:43] and 3D printing. I mean, I can just go down the list. How do you — Bill Gurley: And by the way, that’s another advantage of going to the epicenter is there’s more people doing that all the time. Tim Ferriss: Maybe you could, let’s talk about, people might be surprised by this, but Bob Dylan. I think this is just the quintessential example. Why is he relevant to what we’re talking about? Bill Gurley: When this idea popped in my head, I had finished a third biography and contrasted it with these other two and I just saw all these patterns. VC is a game of pattern recognition I guess my brain has just developed. I was like, “Oh, my God, it’s all this lock thing where these three people had all done the same thing.” And one was a basketball coach, one was a restaurateur and the other was Bob Dylan, not people you would, not industry, “Oh, this is where you should get career development advice.” There’s a part of the Dylan story that most people wouldn’t know unless they had read all the biographies or maybe seen the Scorsese documentary. But the new movie misses the whole thing, which is the pre-New York Bob Dylan was hanging out in Minnesota studying folk music at such a deep level that I feel confident in saying when he left, he knew more about folk music than any other human in Minnesota. And he was borrowing, and maybe that’s even a euphemism. He was stealing his friends albums, he was going into the record store, into these listening booths. He knew all there was to know and had studied every bit of it. And he’s referred to by Scorsese as a music expeditionary. And the people that knew him in New York said he could mimic any one song. It’s not what you would think of when you hear a Dylan song that he had mastered the bedrock underneath and then started innovating. Picasso, by the way, the same thing, perfect realist painter at age 14. If you go to the Barcelona Picasso Museum, it’s in geographic order and you’re shocked at how good a realist this kid was before he went and did this other thing. That bedrock knowledge I think is so differentiating for someone to have all the history and then to start doing the innovation. Tim Ferriss: What was the before and after on Dylan, Minnesota, New York City? And why is that such an important piece of the puzzle? Bill Gurley: By the way, and just to even pile on more on this studious part of Bob Dylan, he did a podcast series for a while where he just walks through all these different genres of music and he’s — Tim Ferriss: You’re talking about Bob Dylan himself? Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Oh, I didn’t realize this. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes. You can go find it. He stopped, but he’s — and then that book he put out of the 50 best songs, the coffee table book that came out two years ago, it’s incredible the amount of knowledge he has about songs outside of his genre, everything. He’s a clear student of what he’s doing. I think this is well known and is covered at the beginning of the movie. He went to New York to find Woody Guthrie, probably the single most deterministic and ambitious mentor pursuit story that I’ve ever heard of. He hitchhiked there with no money and found him and became friends with him. Tim Ferriss: I mean, this echoes back to go where the action is also, right? Bill Gurley: Oh, no doubt. And by the way, he landed in Manhattan at the center of the folk music scene and all those people he was studying when he was listening in Minnesota, they were all there and he got to know them all. If that doesn’t happen, I don’t think Dylan happens. Tim Ferriss: How relevant do you think the go where the action is now considering the access to information using ChatGPT or other tools, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera? Maybe less so access to mentors, although you can have virtual relationships, but how relevant do you think that is? I’ve got my own opinion, but — Bill Gurley: You could certainly have the type of peer and mentor experiences that are remote. I have a great anecdote about MrBeast in the book that we could talk about that was a remote one, but the benefits of being in and around a whole bunch of people that are chasing the same thing is so high. And I think the intuition is, “Oh, well, it’s going to be even more competitive, so why would I go? Wouldn’t it be better to try and do this in a town where it’s less of a big deal?” But the problem is your learning is impacted, your access to peers and mentors is drastically reduced, and then probably most importantly, your optionality gets cut so dramatically. People think that a lot of success stories, they attribute it to luck, but there’s that famous saying, luck is when preparation meets opportunity. And when you’re in the epicenter, both your preparation and your opportunity go up 10 X. And so your ability to just have that lucky moment where you get brought into something is so much higher. Tim Ferriss: The lucky moment is, I think, really important to underscore in terms of going where the action is because there’s a lot you can do virtually, but let’s just say you’re using ChatGPT, you’re going to get what you prompt. In other words, you’re asking for something and that can take you down a rabbit hole, but there, at least in my lived experience, and certainly I still see this happening, when I moved to Silicon Valley in 2000, and then I look back at my angel investing career, I look back at all these collaborations, the vast majority of them did not come from me going out with an agenda and seeking something. They came from serendipitous bumping into somebody at a coffee shop. I literally met Naval Ravikant because I was hitting on his girlfriend at the time when she was getting her coffee, didn’t realize they were together. And then you look at Garrett Camp, Kevin Rose. These are, at a barbecue I met Kevin Rose. And you go down the list and you look at all of these formative, massively impactful, personally and professionally relationships. They almost all came from serendipity and you just don’t seem to get that density unless you’re in the center of the action. And perhaps it’s easier to relocate yourself, I’m sure it is, when you have fewer responsibilities, but God, I can’t even imagine what my life would have looked like had I not left Long Island and then ultimately moved to Silicon Valley. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and same for me. I had thought about the notion of venture capital and practicing it and probably would have jumped at any job I could have got. Like when I was at McCombs here in Austin, I tried to get an interview at Austin Ventures. I didn’t get one, but had they said yes, maybe I practiced there. And I’m glad that didn’t happen. Going and practicing it where I did was the exact right place to do it. I do think if you can, if you can, because there are financial constraints, and if you want to be great at a field and that field has an epicenter, I think you should go. Tim Ferriss: And there are different types of epicenters too. You think about, let’s just say AI, not to repeatedly bang that drum, but you could just say, okay, AI, first thing that comes to mind, Silicon Valley, but this is going to be a bit of a digression, but I remember asking Derek Sivers, a friend of mine, amazing entrepreneur, philosopher programmer, people can look him up, but I asked him, “Who’s the first person who comes to mind when you think of the word successful?” And he said, “Well, actually the most interesting or more interesting question might be who’s the third person who comes to mind?” Because I might say something really obvious like Richard Branson, but is he successful? I don’t really know what his goals were. I’d have to compare his goals to his outcomes. And then you get to the third. Similarly, with an epicenter, you could say Silicon Valley first, but there might be something that is dense in learning, but has other advantages like, I think it’s the University of Waterloo, but one of these universities where industry is trying to raid the academic program because it’s so strong in terms of teaching the technical side. There’s so many different ways to approach it, but let’s talk about a virtual example. You mentioned MrBeast. Could you describe that story? Bill Gurley: Yeah. I actually heard it on a podcast, but I also got a chance to talk to Jimmy Donaldson, so we got it firsthand. When he was infatuated with YouTube, he was one of the first people that was infatuated with YouTube, his parents were rightfully trying to get him to go to school and college, which he wasn’t doing because he was playing around on YouTube all day. He met three other people who were equally fascinated with YouTube. And this is a virtual epicenter story, but it’s really a peer story. One of my six principles is embrace your peers. And I think far too many people have sharp elbows to peers because they think they’re climbing the ladder and they’ve got to beat these people. And the world’s just way too prosperous to have that mindset. You can learn so much and get so much value from co-climbing that you should definitely do that. And I think it’s not taught enough and people don’t do it enough, but Jimmy happened on these three people and they got on a Skype call, he said 20 hours a day and for years — Tim Ferriss: Sounds like Jimmy. Bill Gurley: For years, they shared best practices on this call, which apparently in that world, the color of the icon on the post you do on Instagram to send them to YouTube, like all these little bitty esoteric things can impact conversion. And he said when he was talking about this, that they all became millionaires. And he said, “If you or any random individual had been a fifth person on those calls, you would have too, because of that.” And it’s just a wonderful example of how peers — he on this podcast said something that was very clever. He took the 10,000 hours thing from Gladwell and said, “Well, there were four of us spending 10,000 hours and then sharing ideas so you get 40,000 hours of expertise.” Tim Ferriss: How would you suggest people who are not on YouTube where you can identify outliers perhaps, I shouldn’t say easily. In this day and age, I mean, it’s a sea of participants, but how should people go about seeking peers? And do you rank order your principles in a way, for instance, do you want to first check the box if you can of go where the action is and then embrace your peers because the level will be higher? I think about, for instance, my experience in Silicon Valley, it could have just as easily for something else been Nashville or New York City or who knows, Shanghai. I mean, it just depends on what you’re doing. The mentors, let’s just say like Mike Maples Jr., who taught me the very basic ropes of angel investing, he definitely, without him, I don’t go zero to one in terms of having any basic literacy or access. That was the first rung on the ladder. But then once I was in, you look at people who were, in a sense, just getting started at the time. I mean, holy shit, some of them have really exploded. I mean, they’ve all done really well. Kevin Rose, Naval, Chris Sacca. The remaining — I mean, the latter goes on forever, but 49 rungs after that initial step up, zero to one, it was all peer driven. And those guys, we were comparing notes the whole way. Bill Gurley: See, that’s the thing. I would say, first of all, I would practice it wherever you are. I would practice it virtually. I’d practice it locally. And if you can move to the epicenter, I’d practice it there. I don’t know that it’s an either or thing. You can have multiple groups of peers. You can have multiple circles of peers. But I think there’s only two tests, and one is trust. There are people in this world who view everything as a zero-sum game and they will elbow you out the first chance they can get. And so those shouldn’t be your peers. Those people you should quickly push to the side. Trust and then this shared interest in learning. And if they are equally learning on their own dime in their free time, which is my test for whether you actually truly are passionate about something, if they are doing that also, that’s perfect. And those experiences you’ve talked about, I’ve had so many of them myself, they get excited to tell you what they just learned, right? Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then you reciprocate. And by the way, Mike’s a great example. I really have both a passion and a lot of respect for people that are writers in their industry, and Buffett did it and Howard Marks did it, who I benefited greatly from. I tried my entire career to write quite a bit, but Mike does this. Mike’s very — he’s a huge sharer when it comes to his knowledge about the subject matter and it’s so great — Tim Ferriss: He is. Yeah. Pattern Breakers is an excellent book also. Bill Gurley: So great. Tim Ferriss: Mm-hmm. Yeah, Mike, I’m hoping to see him again soon. It’s been a minute. We’ve talked about MrBeast, Bob Dylan. In both cases, like poor kids with nothing to lose, in a sense. Not in any destitute sense, but they’re starting at — Bill Gurley: It’s funny — Tim Ferriss: — futons and ramen, right? Bill Gurley: He was just interviewed at DealBook also, and his mother was in the front row who apparently works for him now. He was telling the story about when he went to tell her he was dropping out of college, similar to the McConaughey story, not quite as abrupt, or Jimmy’s being more abrupt, but of course she’s happy now. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, it all worked out. I mean, there’s always a little survivorship bias, but — Bill Gurley: No doubt, no doubt. Tim Ferriss: But let’s talk about Danny Meyer because I want to give an example of someone who gave something up to then pursue X instead of A, B, or C. Could you say a little bit about Danny? I’ve interviewed him on the podcast. I might have met him through you. I don’t even remember how I initially connected with him, but who is Danny Meyer and what is this Genesis story of Danny Meyer, the restaurateur? Bill Gurley: It’s funny, when someone asks me who is Danny Meyer, I feel compelled the first thing to say he’s one of the most genuine humans on the planet. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: Just a wonderful human. Tim Ferriss: For sure. Bill Gurley: But he is also one of the most celebrated restaurateurs of our time. He was working for a company that sold these devices to clip onto clothes so you can’t steal them from a retail store, and he was making good money. He was making about $200,000 a year, and this is — Tim Ferriss: At the time. Bill Gurley: — 40 years ago. Tim Ferriss: Real money. Bill Gurley: Real, real money. And he had convinced himself he was going to be a lawyer. I guess a lot of people convinced themselves of that. And he was about to take the LSAT and he was out to dinner with his uncle and his uncle was probing him and probing him and, “Oh, yeah, he’s going to take the LSAT.” And I think his uncle sensed a lack of real conviction about this thing, this person, this human was going to do. And he literally said to him, “Why are you doing this? You know you want to be a restaurateur.” And when you read Danny’s book, he did spend a ton of time in his youth being fascinated with restaurants and to the point where he would take copious notes prior to even doing this. His family had a reason to know that he had this deep passion, but it’s interesting it’s an uncle. I don’t know that a parent is going to jump in and say that, and maybe that’s an advantage I have not knowing the readers of my book and giving him this permission to do things that aren’t necessarily pragmatic. But anyway, his uncle said, “You should start a restaurant.” And he took the test. He never submitted the scores to a university and very soon thereafter enrolled in some vocational restaurant courses and took a job. He took the first job you could get, which was a front office job at a restaurant that was making about a 10th the salary that he was making in the sales job. Tim Ferriss: And went on to Gramercy Tav — I mean, all these iconic restaurants, then Shake Shack, then I mean, just dot, dot, dot, dot, dot. Bill Gurley: Yeah, and we walked through in detail his path once he made this intention, and one of the variables that my co-writer and I were looking for as we added stories to the book was this moment of intentionality. We didn’t want people that fell into a job and were successful. We wanted people that had made a decision, usually a pivot to say, “I’m going to go do this now.” And once he had made that decision, not only did he take that job, but he took advantage of being in that restaurant to learn about the multiple functions, but then he set up a tour through Europe as a stage in multiple places where he’s working for free, basically. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I’m so glad you brought this up because I wouldn’t have brought it up myself, but I’ve run — this is going to relate in a second. I’ve run a bunch of competitions for, let’s just say, creating artwork for PDFs/free books I’m going to put out or whatever, and there’s always a big hubbub where folks get, some folks get very upset and they say, “Oh, you want people to work for free?” And I’m like, “Well, there’s going to be a winner.” It’s like, if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But there’s always this shaking of the fist like, “Ah, it’s so unfair. You want people to work, do work for free.” When I look at almost every example of someone who became the equivalent of Danny Meyer in their world, they did a lot that was unpaid, almost always. I’m sure there are exceptions, but staging is a great example in the restaurant world where it’s like, okay, you want to work at a restaurant where you’re going to have the highest density of learning and you don’t know shit? Guess what? They probably don’t want to pay you a whole lot because it’s actually going to be a bit of a drain on their resources to show you around and teach you how to work your station and do all this stuff. I would just encourage people to not be allergic to that. And the way I got, in a sense, my foot in the door in Silicon Valley was I volunteered at TiE, The Indus Entrepreneur. Bill Gurley: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:22:33]. Tim Ferriss: I volunteered with all of these nonprofit groups and quickly realized that most volunteers are doing the absolute minimum to be volunteers. And if you just do 10% more, it doesn’t take much. I would just refill people’s water glasses and stuff after I finished taking their tickets for an event. And suddenly the producers of this event who were also doing it, but had real jobs. I mean, I had a job at a college [inaudible 01:23:00] and I was working a lot. They were like, “Wow, this kid’s a go getter because he’s refilling these water glasses. Let’s give him more responsibility.” And that’s how I ended up connecting with all these speakers and everything, just did some stuff for free on the weekends. It didn’t take a lot. Bill Gurley: There’s a story in the book that’s actually hard to believe. We profiled this woman, Jen Atkins, who’s a hairstylist. It’s an incredible story, but the one anecdote, she’s rising in her career and things are starting to work and she has jobs and she’s getting paid. She would go to Fashion Week in Paris and sneak in the back door and volunteer to do the hair of the models on stage. Snuck in. Not supposed to be there, just to get reps with these top models in this environment. Tim Ferriss: Incredible. Bill Gurley: It sounds unfathomable that someone would do that. She did it multiple times. Tim Ferriss: And she did it. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: What ended up happening after that? I don’t know her story. Bill Gurley: Oh, she’s become probably the most successful hairstylist of our time. It’s an incredible story. Tim Ferriss: How do you suggest people who are, maybe they’re doing A, B, and C right now, they’re listening to this and they just say, “All right, I want to take the leap. I want to do Z. I want to do whatever the off menu option is.” Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: They might have to have a conversation with a parent. They might have to have a conversation with a spouse. They may have to have a conversation with who knows, whoever the most important people are in their lives. How might they approach that? And we’re going to talk about choosing paths in a second, because I do have a question about maybe how to sanity check yourself in the world of AI, but how do you suggest having those conversations? Do you moonlight for a while so it’s not either or? Do you time box it or make it time bound in a sense where you’re like, “Hey, just give me permission to try this for six months, a year, two years.” Bill Gurley: It’s interesting that I think any of those approaches is realistic. We profile Sal Khan in the book of Khan Academy and he told his wife he wanted to go try it for a year. He had also, he worked at a hedge fund just like Danny Meyer. He was making real money. Tim Ferriss: Wow. I didn’t realize that about Sal Khan. Wild. Bill Gurley: And started working with his cousins across the globe online doing these tutorial exercises and ended up posting a few on YouTube. They started working and he told his wife, “I really want to go tilt at this.” He didn’t even know what the business model was and he went and changed it. Look, I think the real test comes back to this passion element, or we use a lot of different words because passion’s been considered trite, but fascination, curiosity. If you have this deep desire to know so much about this one thing that that curiosity is so high, I think the odds that that’s not apparent to whoever these people are you’re trying to convince is pretty low. And if you can show that you’re — because if you’re going to tilt at something that hard and if you’re going to really differentiate yourself by being that learned in that field, I think it’d be hard for someone to tell you not to go do it. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: It’s not going to be easy. I don’t want anyone to think that, “Oh, just read this book and magic happens.” It requires effort. And that’s why this test matters so much, this test of whether you would learn about this thing on your free time. Tim Ferriss: And maybe are you already learning about this? Bill Gurley: Are you already learning about it on your free time? Tim Ferriss: Right. Bill Gurley: Yes. No doubt. Tim Ferriss: At least have one — Bill Gurley: You should be. You should be. I doubt you’re going to turn it on. Tim Ferriss: — data point based on history. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Well, actually, I have an example of someone who just turned it on. We have a chapter called Never Too Late, which is where the [inaudible 01:27:32] thing is because that happened when he was close to 40. Another local Austinite, Bert Tito Beveridge started his endeavor in the spirit business. Tim Ferriss: So wild, I was just thinking about him while I was driving here for no good reason. Bill Gurley: At the age of 40. Tim Ferriss: All right. Bill Gurley: He’s watching a PBS special. This is also hard to believe. He’s watching a PBS special. And back probably when there were only four channels or whatever, but they said on the screen, they said, “Take a blank sheet of paper, draw a line down it, put what you love to do on the left and what you’re really good at on the right. Just a list of those things and then contemplate what might be in the middle.” And he had studied chemistry and a lot of stuff and he liked going out to bars and socializing. And he was making flavored vodka as Christmas presents in his spare time. Tim Ferriss: What was his day job? Bill Gurley: His first career was in seismetology and the oil field and that dragged him to South America. And then when that became dangerous, both in Midland and in South America, he became a mortgage broker. Tim Ferriss: Okay. Bill Gurley: But he didn’t love either. He didn’t love either of them. But the reason I brought it up when you said, “already.” I don’t know that he was already studying the spirit business, but once he made that intentionality to go do this, then he studied it writ large. Tim Ferriss: How did he start, just out of curiosity? Because I was just thinking about him. He just acquired — well, Tito Beveridge just acquired Lala Tequila, which I was involved with. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: That’s probably why he popped to mind. But how did he start? Bill Gurley: He first started by just studying the distilling process writ large, like read everything he possibly could. And then it turns out there were no distilleries in the state of Texas and there were laws on the books that made it nearly impossible. So then he had to study that and literally rewrite regulation to make it possible. Interestingly, he did the whole thing on credit cards, so he owns 100% of the business, which is a huge business. It’s the single largest spirit sold in America today. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize that. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: I didn’t realize it was that big. Bill Gurley: It’s huge. Tim Ferriss: Wow. Good for him. Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: That’s so wild. So wild. So I promised to get to this and I do want to get to it. Are there any sanity checks that you would put in place to compliment the fascination/obsession/what I’m doing in my spare time or would pay to do or do for free? Because I’m wondering if there are any things you would take off the table or how you would hone that given the rapidly developing technology of AI. So if someone said, “What I love to do in my spare time is copy editing.” I might not suggest that they throw caution to the wind and burn the ships and go into copy editing. Any thoughts? Because this is something that is — Bill Gurley: Well, the first thing I would note is that many of those pragmatic jobs that the well-intentioned parents have been pushing their children towards are at risk. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: So comp-sci. Tim Ferriss: Right. Yeah, risky, but as compared to what? Bill Gurley: Comp-sci went from being the most least risky major you could possibly get to one that’s somewhat risky overnight. And so that’d be my first notion. And the second thing I would add to that, which I already said is, no matter what your endeavor is, you need to be playing with this tool. It’s a modern tool. It’s the equivalent of a laptop and Microsoft Word was, it’s equivalent of what a calculator was. You don’t want to go out in the world and play without the modern tool set. It’s a part of what you need. If you’re playing with those things and you’re curious, you know where the edge is of whatever you’re passionate about and what the technology’s capable of. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. So in order to find that edge and follow that edge, which will move, you have to be playing with the tools. Bill Gurley: And look, I think in any field, one thing I love to suggest on the learning side is, know the history and know the new innovative edge. If you bring both of those things to the table, you are highly compelling. That could be true even if you’re not chasing your dream job. Even if you’re just a marketing major, if you walk into an interview at Clorox and you can simultaneously show that you’ve studied all the historical best marketers and you also understand how TikTok works, that’s heavily differentiating in that interview. Like you’re going to get the job, I would argue, versus someone else, if you can portray those things. Tim Ferriss: How would you apply that here? Is that just, I guess, field dependent or are you referring to AI? Bill Gurley: No. Yeah. Well, I think AI is the leading edge of almost any industry. So yeah, I’m saying you should just study what it’s capable of. Look, the thing that LLMs are most capable of, it’s a large language model. The language type stuff, like your copy editing example, things that were just rote moving words around, yeah, it’s really good at that stuff. But it doesn’t mean that you can’t be the person that really understands what it’s capable of and then superpower yourself to go attack a particular interest. The other thing, you had started a question by saying warnings. I think there are a lot of fields where talent really does matter. I don’t know that I can make you a singer or I certainly can’t make you an NBA basketball player, but in all those fields, whether it be Hollywood or sports or even Danny Meyer at one time thought he was going to be a chef and he just became a restaurateur. He wasn’t a chef. I would say that for any artistic field, there are way more jobs that support those artists than there are the jobs of the artist. Tim Ferriss: What do you mean by that? Bill Gurley: I mean, we have an example in the book of a Hollywood agent and that individual had not thought about a job in Hollywood when they were growing up because they felt they couldn’t act. So they’re like, “Oh, I can’t go do that.” But there’s tons of jobs — Tim Ferriss: I see what you’re saying. Bill Gurley: — in Hollywood that aren’t — Tim Ferriss: Within the sector of entertainment. Bill Gurley: — that aren’t the talent itself. So if you’re passionate about basketball or you’re passionate about the chef example of a restaurant, like there’s tons of jobs you can go do, music industry, without being that particular person. Tim Ferriss: This makes me think of an interview I was watching recently, Patrick O’Shaughnessy, Invest With The Best. He was interviewing Ari Emanuel, so famous super agent, force of nature. His whole family is just like, they’re drinking different water. I don’t know what’s going on there. But he has raised a ton of money to invest in live events, sports and so on as an anti-AI or maybe AI anti-fragile bet, right? And there are lots of ways to make money when you raise a lot of money. So putting that aside, any other AI resilient or anti-AI bets that you think are interesting outside of live events, live sports? Bill Gurley: I think a lot of the service industries, I think humans enjoy experiences and I don’t think that changes personally that much. And so restaurateurs or hoteliers, I think all those things are going to thrive and people that know how to really differentiate experiences in that way, I think are — I personally doubt that — I don’t share this thought that we’re all going to go watch movies that we’ve imagined that are made just for ourselves. I find that hard to believe. I think people enjoy great art in many different forms. They enjoy talking about it and they enjoy the community element of having seen the same thing. And so it may be that if you’re a movie maker, you’re using AI instead of this expensive CGI tool set, but I think the storytelling and the imagination and the writing, I think all those things will still be real. I really do. And obviously just general business, entrepreneurship. I took my dad, who’s 93, fly-fishing in Montana this summer and we were at a lodge and one of the other guests that was staying there is a 28-year-old entrepreneur from the tip of Texas down near Corpus Christi area. And he had started three or four businesses and was well off, like I’m not saying — but he was so enamored with AI. He said, “And then I needed this, and then it did this, and then I needed this, and then I did this. And then I wanted to know where to put the next one of these. And I just ask it, where would you put it in the city? And it immediately gave me answers.” This guy was already successful, but he was running triple speed because he had tipped into this stuff and he was learning what was possible because he had an open mind towards it solving problems. And I thought, “Holy shit, if other people just leaned at it the way he’s leaning at it, they would become super powered themselves.” I was really blown away by that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This makes me think of Kevin Rose. Kevin Rose is spending the vast majority of his free time playing with all these tools, vibe coding, using them endlessly. And I feel like that is probably over the next few weeks where I need to put some more time and just take a layup with wherever it happens to intersect with someplace that makes it easy to apply. Who’s Sam Hinkie? Bill Gurley: Sam Hinkie is a gentleman that about, I don’t know, six years ago became maybe the youngest GM in the history of the NBA. He became the general manager of the Philadelphia 76ers. Tim Ferriss: Why is his story relevant? Bill Gurley: He was a amazing student. He grew up in Oklahoma. His father worked for Halliburton. He made good grades, good students, kind of classic, did everything right, became a consultant. I think he was working for McKinsey, and they moved him to Australia. And he’s sitting there and he’s reading other things in his spare time. He’s not reading about how to be a better consultant. And he reads a book called Moneyball, which we all know of, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland A’s. And in almost what seems like an instant decided, “I really need to be in sports analytics.” And I mentioned that a lot of the stories we found have this intentionality. So that book, just like The Last Laugh did for Seinfeld, that book told him, “I’m going to go do this.” And from the day he read that book to getting the job as the head of GM of the 76ers was about 10 years. So no experience whatsoever in the field to youngest GM of all time in 10 years. Tim Ferriss: Was he obsessed with sports already at that point? Bill Gurley: I think so. He played — this gets back to what I said about maybe your original obsession came from participating or being the talent, but then he’s not particularly big. And so yeah, he was successful in high school, but there was no path to keep going down that field. So yeah, he had immense passion for the category, but had never imagined himself in the field in one of these other roles until that book disinhibited him and gave him permission to think, “Well, you know what? I could be differentiated on this dimension, on this dimension of understanding analytics.” He immediately was applying to business school, and he used that as a pivot point. For those that have the needs and the resources, I think in MBA programs can be a great place to switch careers and go chase a different dream. And there’s a great interesting anecdote in the book where he’s trying to decide between Harvard and Stanford, which is a choice for most humans [inaudible 01:41:42]. Tim Ferriss: Quality problem. Bill Gurley: Yeah, exactly. But he went and told them both what he wanted to do and Harvard basically said, “Well, we don’t really have any programs like that.” And Stanford, to give Stanford a lot of credit, said, “You know what? That’s super interesting. We have this person associated with the school that does this. We’ll introduce you to these four people.” And were a lot like McConaughey’s dad when Sam brought them that challenge. Tim Ferriss: Sounds about right. That checks out for me. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Based on what you know of the two institutions. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. And then he just started, he ended up meeting Michael Lewis because he was in the Bay Area and some of the Stanford people knew Michael. And so he talked to the guy that wrote the book that inspired him. He hustled his ass off. I don’t want to make it sound like — he kind of built his own curriculum, but it worked. Tim Ferriss: For people who are not going to get an MBA, would you still suggest everyone read the first three chapters of Michael Porter’s Competitive Strategy Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors? Bill Gurley: Unquestionably. Tim Ferriss: All right. Just wanted to — Bill Gurley: Anyone that’s going to do anything in business should read that book. Tim Ferriss: All right. I wanted to give the throwback to our first conversation. Bill Gurley: By the way, at the back of the book, it lists about 50 books. At the very end. Tim Ferriss: Just to whet the appetite? Bill Gurley: Well, I think you did the same thing. I’ve gone through your — Tim Ferriss: Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Bill Gurley: In fact, I looked at yours for the structure when I wanted to see how to lay it out. Tim Ferriss: Oh, amazing. Amazing. I want to get your expansion on avoiding false failures. Let me explain what I mean by that. So there’s this expression, if you do what you love, you’ll never work a day in your life. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s in my note. Tim Ferriss: But my experience has been, it’s not always fun, even if you’re doing what you love. Sometimes there’s burnout. Sometimes you go through chapters where things do feel like a grind. I mean, maybe I’m an outlier, but that’s been my experience. When I realized, for instance, in the case of the podcast, it’s like, “Wow, I have much more sponsor demand than I could ever fill. If I just doubled the number of episodes, I’d double the number of revenue. So why don’t I do that?” And it started to feel like a bad job. Not a bad job. Bill Gurley: I get it. Tim Ferriss: It’s still a great job, but the volume was too high. And I can imagine if people take the expression I just mentioned, if you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life. They pursue X, whatever that is, the songwriting and the performing in the case of Bob Dylan, Danny Meyer, whatever it might be. And then they hit a really hard stretch. Maybe it’s early on, maybe it’s later, maybe they’re [inaudible 01:44:46] and some French guy yelling at them. Bill Gurley: Yeah certainly. Tim Ferriss: It’s the case with a friend of mine. And they’re like, “Wow, God, this really feels painful. Maybe this isn’t my path.” How do you distinguish between growing pains that are temporary and an indication that you’re not doing the right thing? Bill Gurley: Yeah. It’s funny. I’ll take a short diversion in answering the question. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Long diversions. Bill Gurley: Because people often ask me, “How do you use AI?” When I was wrapping up the book, my publisher and editor said, “I want you to write the concluding chapter.” And I wrote what I think most people would do, which is I just summarized the whole book and I submitted it to him and he said, “No, this is no good.” And so then I went to ChatGPT deep research mode and I said, “Tell me about the 10 best nonfiction concluding chapters that you know of.” And it went and did like a 20-page report and sent it to me. And what I noticed in reading that was that most of these great concluding chapters were orthogonal. They weren’t a summary. They were a different take on the whole thing. Well, my concluding chapter is now titled It Ain’t Easy, to your point. And I went through all of the stories that we have in the book and I pulled out the darkest hour moments for each one of those people and included it at the end, because I didn’t want to leave people with the impression that it’s just all smiles and babies and hugs. I don’t think that’s true in any field. And I guess my answer would be, do you still feel this natural curiosity to learn the entire time? Is the impediment something that truly means you should stop like, “I can’t get around it. I can’t…” Or is it something that maybe can be avoided, something I can get around? I push heavily on the peer thing because one of the things a peer group can do is help you in those moments, both just from emotional support, but also to put perspective on whatever this speed bump is and whether it’s insurmountable or not. Mentors can help with that too, but I think peers are better for that because you worry about being judged in disclosing this. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, 100%. Bill Gurley: And so peers don’t judge. That’s why that trust thing really matters also, another reason why it matters. And they can help you. I think they can help you determine whether that is as big a blocker as it may seem like. But there’s going to be some of that in any field. I don’t think there’s any run that’s just without paying. Tim Ferriss: I’m also imagining that one of the challenges that I had and some of my friends had at different points in pursuing, fill in the blank, starting our first companies, just beginning to invest, having a career in X, right? When I got out of college, it was mass data storage and hitting these really rough patches and feeling like you’re the first person in the world to experience this and it’s because of your unique flaws or uniquely bad decisions. And I’m just realizing now, I haven’t tried this, I’m sure it would work, that you could just describe the dark chapter you’re going through into ChatGPT or one of these tools and say, “Can you give me any comparable examples from other people who have succeeded in other fields?” Bill Gurley: I’m sure that’ll work. It’ll also give you five answers on how to deal with it, how to get around it. Tim Ferriss: How to deal with it. Bill Gurley: But by the way, one thing that’s important when we’re talking about this is, Daniel Pink has this great book on regret, and he talks about it as a valid motivator to get you to make good decisions. And there is a reality that that anxiety you may feel may mean you’re not in the right lane. And so when you were at that sales job, you got to the point where you’re like, “Holy shit, I don’t want to be doing this anymore.” And I had two careers before I became a VC, one as an engineer and one as a sell-side analyst. I enjoyed both. I think I was good at both, but I reached a point about three years in with each where I was like, “I don’t want to do this the rest of my life.” And so I would say, equally with like, don’t give up too early, but if the signal is really telling you, I don’t want to do this the rest of my life, jump out. That’s the precise moment to move on and try something new. And I spend a ton of time in the early chapters trying to get people to understand that’s okay. Most people don’t end up in a career that their major was. I think one of the reasons people grind too long is because they think they’re supposed to. They just think they’re supposed to stay in this lane they’re in. Tim Ferriss: How did you conclude it was time to hop in those cases? We don’t have to go into tons of the background because we talked about so much of your history and decisions and so on, including, I don’t want to say stealing palm pilots, but it’s a pretty good story about getting a palm pilot with contact information. But was it just a gut feeling? Was it a disquiet that you felt in your system or was it more than that? Bill Gurley: I’m sure I’ve overplayed it in my brain, but they feel like very concrete moments where I had almost near certainty. The first one was, I started my third project at Compact Computer Corporation where I was an engineer and the projects were these computers we were releasing and the third one was another computer with a little faster clock speed and a better Intel chip, but the rest of it was all the same and we were going to do it again. I’m like, “That doesn’t seem that interesting to me.” And I’d become curious about other things. So when I was doing external learning, which is what I refer to as this kind of spare time learning, it wasn’t that. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Right. Bill Gurley: It was something else. I was reading Peter Lynch’s book on stocks and stuff like that. Tim Ferriss: Right. Segue to the sell-side analyst. Bill Gurley: Yes. The thing that happened as a sell-side analyst, and and I may parlay this into something from the Daniel Pink book, but this notion of, do you want to do this the rest of your life? The sell-side job is wonderful. You get access so early in your life to so many amazing people, but you have to work really hard. And this classic thing where you’re in your 20s and you’re working on Wall Street, they serve dinner at the office. The cafeteria is open, that’ll tell you something. And it was like 10:30 or 11:00 PM and the entire research department was on the 36th floor of Park Avenue Plaza and I did a loop. The four corner offices were the most senior analysts. And for whatever reason, I popped my head in each of their office and they were career sell-side analysts. I said, “Do I want to be this person when I’m 60?” It just stuck in my head. I went to the next one, went to the next one. Hopefully — I don’t know who those people were, but I was like, “No, I don’t.” Like that night, I made the decision that I got to go do something else. Tim Ferriss: No, it’s one of — Bill Gurley: If you don’t mind. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, fire away. Bill Gurley: In Daniel Pink’s book, he talks a lot about boldness regrets. And this is where I say, “Do you want to do this for the rest of your life?” He says, “One of the most robust findings in the academic research and my own is that over time we are much more likely to regret the chances we didn’t take than the chances we did.” What haunts us is the inaction itself. Foregone opportunities all linger in the same way.” And he says that they’ve studied this across China, Russia, Japan, it’s common across all of them. And you may have heard of this YouTube video where Bezos talks about his regret minimization framework. And so he had the same thing. He’s walking around Central Park, “Should I stay in this incredible job at D.E. Shaw,” where he’s making tons of money, “or should I take this flyer on this online bookstore I want to do?” And he put it in his mind that test, which is when I’m 80 and looking back, am I going to regret not doing this? Tim Ferriss: Well, it makes me think of, and this is also a dicey proposition quoting Niccolo Machiavelli, but, “Make mistakes of ambition, not mistakes of sloth.” Bill Gurley: Yes. Tim Ferriss: Right? Bill Gurley: It’s the same thing. Tim Ferriss: And I do think about that a lot myself. I mean, I’m at a point where I’m trying to figure out what my next chapter is too, because this podcasting game’s getting pretty crowded. Bill Gurley: It is. Tim Ferriss: And I still enjoy doing it, but that’s only because I refuse to play by the incentives that the platforms and algorithms provide, which is economically punishing, but intellectually rewarding. Bill Gurley: Because you’ve had two successful careers as, not just a podcaster and influencer, but as an angel investor, I would encourage you to read Arthur Brooks’ book, Strength to Strength. Tim Ferriss: I did. I did. It was great. Bill Gurley: Okay. You already read it? Tim Ferriss: It was great. It was great. Bill Gurley: I think it gives great perspective for a later career shift. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I should go back and look at my notes from that book again. So let’s chat for a second. People should all check this out. I mean, you’re such an operator. Track record’s incredible. Runnin’ Down a Dream: How to Succeed and Thrive in a Career You Love, we’ll talk about that again. We’ll mention it again at the end. What do you want to do after this book? I mean, you can’t sit on your hands very long. Bill Gurley: No. And as I mentioned, when I made the decision to stop the venture career, which I think we talked about on the last podcast — Tim Ferriss: A little bit, yeah. Bill Gurley: — where I read the Steve Martin book. But I didn’t know. I knew I wanted to do something else. And I went on a listening tour and I talked to all these people that had — Tim Ferriss: Can you just reiterate what a listening tour is? Bill Gurley: Oh, I identified several people who had successfully—retired is a strong word—but made a decision to stop doing a job they were very successful at. And then what do you do now? It’s similar to the Arthur Brooks book, but it was just a personal life. A lot of people angel invest, a lot of people go on boards, a lot of people manage their own money. I had this list that people teach and I slowly was checking them off. Tim Ferriss: Just crossing out, yeah. Bill Gurley: Scratch them out, yeah. I don’t really want to manage my own money. I don’t really want to angel invest. I don’t want to start my own venture firm. I’ve done that. I found myself crossing them all off and I couldn’t discover something that got me excited and tied into this what are you doing with your external learning thing. Slowly, I’ve come around to an idea that I made up. It’s not a career that other people have, but I think I’d like to start a policy institute. I’ve come up with a name P3, which stands for Purpose, Progress, and Prosperity. When I was doing the BG2 podcast, which I recently stepped away from, we did a episode at the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Facility. Before I did that episode, I spent three or four weeks calling everyone I knew to make sure that I was prepared for that. That was one of our more successful episodes and I just really enjoyed that. I look at the shifting mindset around the globe on nuclear energy in the past five years as an example of what’s possible with really great policy work. It wasn’t one person. I think the fact that Steve Pinker was banging the drum was super important, but Andreessen and Elon and all these people started pounding that same drum. Joe Gebbia’s wife made this a big life passion project of hers. But it’s shocking how quick we went from, “This stuff’s bad,” to, “Oh, no, we made a mistake. It’s actually good.” That could have a powerful impact on the planet. I don’t know how many of those type things there are to find. I don’t want to go grind on state by state legislation. I don’t have any interest in that. But looking at big problems, looking at US-China relations, US healthcare system has some massive problems. Can you come up with ideas that help shift these things? I’ve already got to know some really innovative professors who are thinking in very innovative ways and I look to use my financial capabilities to do grant writing through people like that and see what we can go do, see what we can go change. Regulatory capture is another one that I’ve spent time tilting at. Tim Ferriss: If you’re not doing this state by state legislative change, what does the work of P3 potentially look like? What is policy work? I know that seems like a silly question but — Bill Gurley: We’re at day one, but I’ll give you — Tim Ferriss: What might it look like? Bill Gurley: Yeah, here’s an example. A professor approached me on the regulatory capture front. “What if we put — Tim Ferriss: Could you define that just for people who didn’t hear episode one? Bill Gurley: Yeah. There’s a Nobel Prize winner from the University of Chicago named George Stigler. He’s passed away but who made the very strong argument that regulation is the friend of the incumbent, that large businesses learn how to lobby Washington. No matter how well intention the policy is that’s passed, it ends up benefiting the incumbent more than restricting the incumbent. He won a Nobel Prize for that work. I gave a speech at the All-In Summit that you can go watch on YouTube. It has five million views on this topic, but I think this happens in the majority of the time rather than — anyway, this — Tim Ferriss: That’s why ACH takes three days to clear, right? Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes, but stablecoin may solve that. But this professor approached me about making maybe a global database that scores countries on how captured they are and that identifies the best practices from the countries that have the best scores. That kind of thing, like investing in that type of data and transparency, is pretty compelling to me. That’s an example of what I might go do. Tim Ferriss: Well, let me chew on that for a second. Let’s say you create this data set that presents these scores on a country by country basis. What are the hoped for outcomes of that? That countries that have worse scores start to model the countries with better scores? Certainly, there might be talent flight from one place to another. I mean, we already see that in some respects. I mean, that’s not purely regulatory capture determined, but when you share that data, what would the hope be? Bill Gurley: The hope would be that you can shine a light on the best practices and try to get those implemented — Tim Ferriss: In other places. Bill Gurley: — here in the US. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: That would be the hope. Also, I think just shining a light on them is — I’ll give you an example that relates to regulatory capture. After you’ve been a senator or congressman for a while, you get invited onto committees. The minute you’re on a committee, you are in charge of regulation that affects different industries. I don’t even know if most humans know this. What happens is your local senator or your local congressman who you think is representing your district now starts raising money nationally. They go around and meet with businesses because they’re on that committee and have influence and they’re raising money nationally. I think that’s ridiculous personally. You could imagine restrictions against that, transparency towards it. If your congressman represents this zip code in Austin, wouldn’t you want to know if they’re raising money in Minnesota? Isn’t that a little unusual? Tim Ferriss: Well, you shared a story last time we spoke about being asked to raise a hundred grand in donations just to get a meeting with a Congress. Bill Gurley: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah. Our mutual friend, Rich Barton, talks about shining flashlights in dark places. This technology that we have access to should — I think donations should be on the blockchain, quite frankly. There’s no reason why this information needs to be in the dark. I think there’s a lot of opportunity around data aggregation. Tim Ferriss: Any other ideas that are percolating? Bill Gurley: I’m enamored by state versus state competition. Part of it pops into my brain from the China experience and the provincial competition, but you see Newsom and Abbott fighting back and forth, and maybe there can be a positive outcome from this. I think some of the Federalist Papers envisioned that different states could try different experiments and we could see what happens as a result of that. Tim Ferriss: We’re seeing some of it with Texas and Arizona. Bill Gurley: We are seeing something. I think it could be pretty interesting and provocative and could lead to positive change. I have this dream that some state, and maybe this state that we’re sitting in that has a surplus, would do something crazy with teacher salaries. What if a state just all of a sudden said, “We’re going to pay 50% more for teachers”? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Think about the dynamic that would create. It’d be pretty wild. Tim Ferriss: It would be. Bill Gurley: Maybe I’ll go tilt it that one, too. Tim Ferriss: So other problems on your mind — well, I’ll just present a list here from some prep notes. We have US healthcare, regulatory capture, intellectual property, US-China, fairness and financial markets, US K-12. Could you speak to intellectual property and fairness in financial markets, how you might be thinking about those? Bill Gurley: I’ve got to be a top 10,000% supporter of open source. This gets back to Ridley’s book, The Rational Optimist, but he talks about prosperity comes when ideas have sex. Just the sharing of information, in my mind, should be free, that it shouldn’t cost anything. It’s very unclear to me that the patent system actually adds value. I’m quite doubtful that the human mind wouldn’t innovate if it didn’t come with a 17-year financial protection. I’m doubtful of that. I think there’s great scientists at every university working on problems that aren’t necessarily being patented. Your ability for hyper competition and innovation is so much higher when there aren’t restrictions in place. Anyway, I think the world’s a better place when ideas are shared and not protected. Tim Ferriss: Since the system we’re working with is the system we’re currently working with, how might something like drug development work without patent protection? Bill Gurley: Well, here’s an interesting thing. The NIH gives out $40 billion a year and a lot of that money goes to companies that end up getting venture capital backing. Tim Ferriss: I’ve had some very open fights with people about this. Bill Gurley: Yeah. Why doesn’t an NIH grant come with an open source rider? Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah. If the VCs want to fund — Tim Ferriss: With federal funding, yeah. Bill Gurley: Yeah, it’s federal funding. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, I agree with that. Bill Gurley: Right now, there’s a big fight over whether just their research papers have to go on non-private networks instead of the private ones they’re on today. I mean, they just want the information out there. That’s a minor step I would consider a major step. You don’t have to take the money, but why is the US government giving people money that ends up becoming proprietary inventions? That makes no sense to me. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Whether it’s the US government or individual philanthropists or foundations. I mean, on some level, if that, then at some point — right. I agree with that, but are there industries that — I mean, the only one that first came to mind was drug development where the R&D costs are so high. Bill Gurley: They all cry. The VCs will tell you, “It’ll never work. No one will have any incentive if we don’t have a 17-year protection.” The entire Silicon Valley — Tim Ferriss: I’m not saying I believe that. Bill Gurley: I know. I’ve lived in a world where if someone comes into our office and talks about patents, we roll our eyes because none of the types of businesses that we’ve backed at Benchmark in Silicon Valley are ever about patents. Elon has famously open sourced all his Tesla patents. It’s such a bold thing to do and so gracious, I think, really to society, but his point is — oddly, I was talking to Ted Cruz about this and he said, “Yeah, Elon thinks the same thing.” He views the edge of competition is how fast are you moving, how great are your products, the consumers love them, not, “Can I defend them in a court of law?” The protection that the drug guys get is so much — no one can really use software patents to get protection, an algorithm, or something. No one even tries. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: But with drugs, if I have this particular genome sequence, all of a sudden I get this huge proprietary window in the market. It’s just nutty. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. This is not exactly the same thing, but, I mean, what a service to humanity. I was just watching — I think the documentary name, people can watch it for free on YouTube and other places, The Thinking Game, about DeepMind and Demis and his team really seeing AlphaFold. I mean, all the structures of these proteins, I mean, it’s just like, oh, my God, what an incredible resource for humanity. Bill Gurley: Well, there’s an interesting example right there. The original paper they wrote was open source and OpenAI doesn’t exist without that discovery, which happened at Google in an open source. They just exploited it the fastest. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, wild. Bill Gurley: And by the way, I mean, not to divert too much back, but right now China has 10 open source AI models that are all in hyper competition with each other. That is a dangerously effective primordial soup for innovation compared to what we have here. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, I should probably know this, but I don’t, how does China handle — what are the policies around and laws around intellectual property, patents, things like that? Bill Gurley: Well, interestingly, I found a document online that someone had put together a PowerPoint about the history of open source at China and it’s 20 years old. It’s not like they just stumbled into it. Go back 20 years ago, one of the primary criticisms of China was that they stole IP. If you’re the Chinese government and there’s this new thing called open source, you’re going to embrace it because there’s no fault there because everyone’s sharing and everyone — If you look at the big open source projects, Linux, MySQL, and you go on the webpages, you’ll see Alibaba, Tencent — these companies have been supporting these technologies for a while. Every five years, they write this five year plan, the Chinese government puts it out. Five years ago, they had a huge section on open source. They’re clearly suggesting to the entrepreneurs that the government favors that approach. Going back to Ridley’s book and the notion of pure competition, I think the society — Tim Ferriss: This is The Rational Optimist? Bill Gurley: Yeah, I think the society benefits from that. I use this example. Imagine there’s two feudal societies that are all agricultural based. There’s two of them, though. And in one, once a week the farmers come to market and just trade goods and then they leave. And the other one, the farmers come to market and they’re required to share their best practices with everybody else and then they leave. Going back to this peer example in the book, that one’s going to be much more performant than the other one. This gets to Ridley’s point about ideas having sex. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. I mean, open source also, we talked about this a decent amount in our last conversation, but it can be used as an incredible strategy or counterpunch from for-profit companies like Android. I mean, my God, I mean, it’s like you can do a lot. It’s an incredibly powerful tool. Bill Gurley: I think that using open source as a defensive tool instead of an offensive tool is one of the most sophisticated corporate strategies a company can possibly do. It’s very hard to do because it goes against all of your instincts. But I would suggest that Amazon and Apple and maybe Meta who has toyed with it should run at the idea of jointly supporting an open source model. I don’t think they’re doing it, but I think they should, because their incumbency is at risk if someone else has a massive proprietary advantage. Tim Ferriss: Fairness in financial markets, what does that mean? Bill Gurley: I’ve been tilting against this insider’s game of the IPO market for some time and I’m very passionate that when you bring a company public — Tim Ferriss: Does that come with the luxury of retirement or — Bill Gurley: Maybe. I mean, yeah, if you tilt against the investment banks, you got to be comfortable not going to conferences, that’s for sure. They owe some really nice funds. You fall off the invite real quick. But the way that an IPO’s price is so God awful stupid, they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. I’ve said it over and over again, but a freshman comp size student and a freshman finance student, if you told them to design the IPO, they would just match supply and demand anonymously. It’s how every bond is priced. It’s interestingly how every initial coin offering works. I’ve become a late to the game crypto enthusiast because I’m so sick of this damn IPO process being broken. Tim Ferriss: Could you say a bit more about how it’s broken? Just walk us through a hypothetical example of why it’s broken. Bill Gurley: Yeah. When a company’s coming public, the bankers — literally, they ask everyone for orders, but then they pick who gets the stock and they pick the price. They don’t let supply and demand pick. Supply and demand can automagically pick the allocation and the price. Automagically is the wrong word, can algorithmically. This is super easy. It’s not hard. Tim Ferriss: Why don’t they do it that way? Bill Gurley: Because they’re handing free money to their clients. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, there we go. That’s what I was looking for. Bill Gurley: Yeah. No, it’s been known for a long time. I uncovered an email from 1999 at Goldman Sachs, which I’ve posted on Twitter several times where they’re like saying, “Oh, we can use this hot stock to reward our top clients.” They know what’s going on. The fact that the SEC doesn’t get involved really bothers me, but this tokenization thing is a real way to get around it because the crypto community’s already decided to use algoriththms to allocate and determine price. The price and the allocation should just be determined. It’s how direct listing work. Everyone knows how to do it. They just don’t do it. It’s horrible. But there’s other things too in this category. The long prevalence of Visa and MasterCard is just ridiculous, 2.5%, and stablecoins have so much momentum right now. I think those two companies are going to be in real trouble within a five-year window. Most of the financial problems are pure regulatory capture, like the reason that there’s a problem. Tim Ferriss: Tell me if I’m explaining this well, because I’m not sure we said this directly, but basically the incumbents help to write laws and regulations that favor them and prevent newcomers from competing effectively. Bill Gurley: After ’09, we wrote this thing Dodd-Frank and we thought, “Oh, we’re going to make things better,” and all you’ve had is consolidation and banking since then. Tim Ferriss: Yeah. Bill Gurley: If you look at the offering, especially at the low end for the poorest citizens of the US, free checking went away. The poor people have a hard time paying their bills, so they don’t even have the tools to do it because free checking went away. Free checking went away after Dodd-Frank. Tim Ferriss: Right. Just to please push back if I’m oversimplifying this, but the regulatory capture is not just bad for startups in Silicon Valley who hope to grow and disrupt and fill in the blank, it’s also bad for everybody. Bill Gurley: Oh, it’s horrible for consumers. I mean, the US healthcare situation, which seems to be getting worse on a daily basis, is a huge example of regulatory cap. Somewhere in the past 10 years, they just told physicians they can’t run hospitals. They just eliminated probably — I mean, who other than a doctor is going to go start a new hospital? The amount of competition you eliminated in this one swoop is enormous, just enormous. That’s just a single example, but there’s hundreds of them in that area. Tim Ferriss: What would success be for this book? Six months after it comes out, what will lead you to have been happy with putting the time in? It’s taken a while. It’s taken a lot of work. What do you hope the outcome will be? Bill Gurley: It really started as a passion project and I have no financial goals for whatsoever. In fact, as we get to book launch, I’m going to launch a foundation that gives grants to people who want to chase their dream job but don’t have the financial wherewithal to do it. I’m going to start working on that in addition to P3. For me, it’s all about how many people do I affect in the way that McConaughey’s dad did or that this book did for Seinfeld. Some of them saw the talk on YouTube from the UT presentation that I gave and I’ve already reached out and said thank you and they’ve shared how it changed their life. But the more people I can do that for, I will just be tickled pink. I’d just be so excited, because I think when people get out of this pragmatic lane and go do these types of things, they tend to be unusually successful, which I think then has a bigger impact than just on them themselves. Tim Ferriss: Yeah, for sure. Bill Gurley: The number of humans positively impacted by Danny Meyer’s success is in the thousands, I’m certain. Tim Ferriss: Oh, for sure. Bill Gurley: And I’m not counting customers of Shake Shack. Tim Ferriss: People, check it out. I mean, I love your writing, Bill. You’re not just a commentator. You’ve been an operator.

The story ended for her when Amara was sentenced as a terrorist. Or so she thought. Nearly two decades on, a now-paroled Amara reached out. Initially dubious about his claims of rehabilitation, Shephard takes the time to get to know him over several months; the resulting piece is profound. Shephard discovers Amara to be sincere in his search for redemption, but finds that the police and the prison system played no part in his turnaround. Instead, a few key individuals and Amara’s own reading and writing influenced him. But it is not just Amara that has changed. In reviewing her reporting from 20 years ago, Shephard finds herself discomfited by its sensationalist tone, noting that “[a] right-wing blog calling our coverage a triumph of ‘beat reporting over political correctness’ made me feel queasy.” She returns to Amara’s story with a nuanced perspective on how radicalization has “many factors and stages that can last years before police are involved,” and awareness that deradicalization programs need “an intense one-on-one approach involving mentors who have credibility with vulnerable youths.” It is rare—and brave—to review your work with 20 years of hindsight, and while Shephard claims no regrets in her previous reporting, there’s more than one redemption story here. The same writer and subject, a new insight. —CW Clint Rainey | Fast Company | January 7, 2025 | 2,530 words A few months ago, I took my daughter to Pretend City, a children’s museum in Southern California that’s laid out like a miniature town. You can imagine the chaos inside such a space, with children running around pretending to be adults that have things to do and places to be. The grocery store is such a place, and in this kid-sized city, it manifests as a big and boldly branded Trader Joe’s, with colorful wall ads and adorably packaged products. As my daughter enthusiastically selected fake food off the shelves, I had a realization. While I haven’t shopped at Trader Joe’s in ages, I’ve continued to view the brand fondly and positively, ever since shopping there in my 20s. Lured by the inexpensive prices, convenient options, and “exotic” food aisle, Trader Joe’s made shopping and cooking accessible, even fun, when I was a young adult living on my own in San Francisco for the first time. But as Clint Rainey reports, the company has faced a lot of bad press recently: a series of product recalls, low rankings by environmental and animal welfare watchdog groups, and reports of intellectual property theft and workplace misconduct. In this Fast Company read—the first in a three–part series about the company’s brand identity and business practices—Rainey digs into why Trader Joe’s remains one of America’s favorite supermarkets despite the negative press. I apologize in advance if this story shatters the eco-friendly, good-vibes image of your beloved neighborhood Trader Joe’s. But I won’t hold it against you if you decide to pop in one last time to stock up on those sweet and salty umami rice crunchies—they’re ridiculously irresistible. —CLR Fatima Syed | The Local | January 14, 2025 | 4,359 words When I read news articles about Trump’s moves to end asylum and suspend the refugee resettlement program in the US, it’s often hard to see what that looks like on an individual and human level. Many stories on migration and immigration feel abstract, full of numbers and figures, describing people en masse. “It’s easy to forget that every single person migrating has a story,” Longreads writer Caitlin Dwyer once told me. For The Local, Fatima Syed offers a wide view of the shelter crisis in Peel, a suburban municipality in the greater Toronto area. But at the center of this feature is a powerful story of one woman, Delphina Ngigi. Shunned and attacked for being bisexual, she left Kenya—and her four children—and made the journey to Canada. For decades, the Peel region had a “no turn away” policy, but that approach has become unsustainable. Since 2023, Peel’s shelters have been unable to keep up with the surge of asylum seekers such as Delphina, a situation made worse by a severe housing crisis. (One Ontario organization providing transitional shelters saw a 700-percent increase in requests during the pandemic, almost half of whom were asylum seekers.) Delphina arrived in Canada in February 2024, hoping to declare asylum and find a bed at a shelter in Mississauga—only to die waiting for one, on just her fourth day in the country. The Peel municipality’s response to the influx of asylum seekers has saved lives, turning hotels into crisis shelters and providing social work, health care, and community support. It wants to help. But, as Delphina’s death shows, this Band-Aid approach isn’t enough. Syed writes a heartbreaking, necessary read of one woman seeking refuge, while deftly reporting on the compassionate people and organizations on the ground who want to create a real system, and real solutions, to help those like Delphina who land on their doorsteps. —CLR David Roth | Defector | 3,438 words | January 28, 2025 Dispatches from the Consumer Electronics Show have been a mainstay of the tech media for more than 25 years. Given the lurching evolution of the technology industry, those dispatches have diversified just a bit. All the way back in 2013, John Gruber wrote that “[t]here’s a nihilistic streak in tech journalism that I just don’t see in other fields.” But that streak is also increasingly warranted. What other industry has generated so much money from our attention, emotions, and data? All of this to say that Defector sending David Roth to CES is likely the apotheosis of Nihilistic CES Dispatch—and you’ll devour it gleefully. Once upon a time, Roth’s brand of polemic might have been dismissed as “snark.” It is anything but. Roth is deeply unsettled by the tech industry, and he’s deeply unsettled by CES, but what unsettles him the most about both is their insistence on the inevitability of AI. “The technology currently lavishly fucking up your grocery order in a supervised setting,” he writes, “will soon make you breakfast and drive you to work and help raise your child and manage both your glucose levels and those of your pet. It will know everything about you, and it will also care about you.” That’s just the backdrop. Roth navigates the Las Vegas Convention Center with something like awe. Or horror. Or something in between. CES is a zombie show of sorts: there are products from Kodak and Memorex and Radio Shack, all of which are no longer the original companies but rather conglomerates that now own their trademarks. “‘I once loved Memorex’s VHS tapes, so I will now buy this Memorex e-scooter,’ is on the merits an absurd value proposition, but not much more or less absurd than anything else in that space,” he writes. There are gadgets, obviously, many of which seem to be internet-connected sex toys. But what Roth is really interested in is the mounting evidence that our humanity is being extracted, reproduced, and monetized: “The fantasy and utility of AI, for the unconscionably wealthy and relentlessly wary masters of this space, converge in a high and lonesome abstraction—technology designed less to do every human thing for you than to replace all those human things with itself, and then sell that function back to you as a monthly subscription.” Roth has long been a gifted critic of greed—greed in sports, greed in entertainment, greed in politics. But in this specific moment, when we’ve watched a cadre of Big Tech CEOs paying fealty to a demonstratedly corrupt president, that greed has never felt so threatening. At least someone’s on the ramparts trying to help you see it. —PR Charlotte Bailey | Prospect | January 29, 2025 | 5,457 words Asbestos was banned in the UK in 1999. While the number of asbestos-related deaths—at least 5,000 annually—is expected to fall over time, activists are still sounding the alarm about the asbestos that remains in schools, hospitals, homes, and other older buildings in the UK. For Prospect, Charlotte Bailey traces the history and use of asbestos over the decades. Indispensable during World War II, it was hailed as a “mineral of victory and safety” and a crucial building material for the future. After the war, however, big businesses discovered (and buried) the truth: Asbestos exposure was a health risk for everyone, not just factory workers. One woman who studied patients diagnosed with mesothelioma, an aggressive cancer affecting the lining of organs, discovered they had all been exposed to asbestos, yet none of them had worked in the industry. (“They’d been plumbers, housewives and mechanics, a school building inspector and a teacher.”) For Bailey, these facts hit close to home: Her father also died from mesothelioma, likely a result of his time as an apprentice accountant, during which he also did a lot of manual labor in the building. “I had only the haziest understanding of asbestos as some dangerous substance used in decades past,” she writes. “But as I cared for my father, I learned how it came to be ubiquitous in our infrastructure.” Bailey’s reporting on the industry is thorough and vital, while her retelling of her father’s rapid decline, interwoven in the piece, is heartfelt and powerful. “My father was a character in the epilogue of an old story,” she writes. Asbestos may be considered a problem of the past in the UK, but as Bailey shows, this “killer dust” lingers and continues to impact thousands of lives each year. —CLR David Farrier | Emergence Magazine | January 23, 2025 | 4,916 words Spring melts seem to happen earlier, and warmer fall months stretch out, shortening the winter season. To a human who abhors the cold, this might seem like a good thing, but for animals and plants, it can alter and perhaps even endanger their life cycles. Consider mammals that emerge from hibernation earlier than usual, before their preferred foods proliferate. Consider plants that may flower too early, before critical pollinators are out and about. As David Farrier explains in this lyrical piece, such mistiming is called a chronoclasm: “a collision of different orders of time.” What’s behind these somewhat scary developments? You guessed it: climate change due to global warming. But this essay is not all doom and gloom—far from it. Farrier’s poetic look at wild intervals is accessible and thoughtful. He gives equal (ahem) time to reasons we can be hopeful about evolving ecological dependencies and partnerships, such as how new tree species might flourish in forests where conditions were once too cold for them. “Time lives in the body, not as the tick of the clock, but as a pulse in the blood,” he writes. “It is a thought, buried deep in nerve, leaf, and gene. . . . As wild clocks fall out of measure, can we recalibrate our sense of time and foster a rhythm by which all life can flourish?” We know we can’t rewind the clock and reset Earth’s climate. It’s refreshing, however, to read a piece that predicts what the future might hold while planting the seeds of hope. —KS Fletcher Reveley | Undark Magazine | February 19, 2025 | 9,195 words I’ve read some fascinating forensics stories in the past year, and this haunting piece by Fletcher Reveley digs into how Chile has applied the science, unfortunately to disastrous results, in crimes of mass atrocity. For Flor Lazo, the past 50 years have been a “long, long, long, long road in search of the truth.” Her father, two brothers, and two uncles were among the more than 1,000 people who were forcibly disappeared after the 1973 coup, under Augusto Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship. Reveley describes how in the late ’80s, forensic anthropologists began to investigate the regime’s mass graves. A series of scientific errors by the state’s forensic unit, the Servicio Médico Legal, marred the effort, misidentifying victims and delivering bodies to the wrong families. (For years, Lazo visited the grave containing what she believed was her brother Rodolfo’s remains, but after the bones were later exhumed—without her family’s knowledge—she learned that they were not his.) Reveley writes about the devastating affect these grievous mistakes have on victims’ loved ones: “For many of the affected relatives, the impact was seismic, forever altering their relationship to science, the state, and the notion of truth itself.” DNA analysis, remote-sensing technology, and a new initiative under Chile’s current president hold the promise of uncovering the remains of more victims, but as Reveley shows, Lazo and other Chileans continue to grapple with the injustice of these killings and hope for closure that they may never get. This is a meticulously reported account of a dark part of Chilean history, but also the extraordinary journey of families who have shown resilience over a lifetime of suffering. —CLR Julia Webster Ayuso | Noēma | January 28, 2025 | 4,354 words Imagine a language so beautiful and precise that there’s a word to describe “a female reindeer that has lost its calf of the same year but is accompanied by the previous year’s calf.” For the Sámi, Europe’s only recognized Indigenous community, that word is čearpmat-eadni. As Webster Ayuso says, the Sámi also have terms for specific types of snow, “everything from åppås, untouched winter snow without tracks; to habllek, a light, airy dust-like snow; and tjaevi, flakes that stick together and are hard to dig.” Given a warming planet under climate change, will habllek still occur? If that term is used less and less, could it possibly disappear from the Sámi lexicon, and with it, a richer experience of the world? Could preserving languages be one way to help fight climate change and encourage conservation? I learned a lot reading Julia Webster Ayuso’s piece for Noēma. Here, language and science intertwine like twin strands of DNA, and like DNA, they hold the key to preserving life on this planet. The number of languages spoken in the world is dwindling due to shrinking populations, climate change migration, and of course, colonization. “More than half of the world’s 8 billion people speak one of just 25 languages,” she writes. “Most of the remaining 7,139 languages have only a few speakers.” But Webster Ayuso suggests that the environment benefits when language and culture propagate. She cites as one example Hawaiian, which by 1980 was spoken by only 1,500 people. (Colonizers had routinely shamed and punished Hawaiian speakers, and the language languished.) Education programs for young people helped pull that back from the brink; by 2016, the number of Hawaiian speakers had grown by a factor of 10. This revival parallels the lot of the honu, or green sea turtle, “a powerful symbol of Hawaiian culture”: As the Hawaiian language found a new foothold, honu nesting populations grew by five percent annually. Now if only the whole planet wasn’t at such a steep, ongoing, collective loss for words. —KS Adlai Coleman | The Delacorte Review | February 25, 2025 | 6,390 words When I write editor’s picks and recommendations for our weekly Top 5, I make notes about the piece and collect passages to spark my imagination. I know a story is special when my digital scratchpad fills quickly. This is what happened with Adlai Coleman’s Delacorte Review essay. Coleman goes to West Virginia “looking for harm.” There, he meets Danni Dineen and Donna Coleman, two women working to reduce harm for members of their community. Danni runs the Quick Response Team for the city of Charleston, a group of EMTs and recovery specialists who respond to overdose-related 911 calls, offering life-saving Narcan. Danni has been sober for nearly four years; she was given Narcan 23 times before she got treatment. Both her mother and younger sister died of overdoses. Her older sister overdosed and was placed on life support. Now, life support is exactly what Danni does for a living. When not responding to 911 calls, she’s doing wellness checks and connecting with people while she hands out water, bus passes, and Narcan. She meets people exactly where they are because she’s been there. She doesn’t judge. She keeps trying, knowing that today could be the day that a client quits drugs for good. “Danni spends her days holding doors open and watching people walk by,” writes Coleman. Over in Ripley, a town in Jackson County, Donna is the only employee of the Bo-Mar Drop-In-Center, where help varies widely, but always meets an immediate need. Sometimes it’s a free hot sandwich and a safe place to sit for awhile. Sometimes it’s finding a bed in a treatment facility. Sometimes it’s asking a few questions that show she knows what someone is up to, but that she cares anyway. Donna probes to find out what someone needs now, something that might get them one step closer to recovery. Coleman is a keen observer and clocks his own awkwardness, first at developing rapport with Donna and then at making eye contact with the Bo-Mar clients. “There is quiet appraisal in Donna’s gaze, a gentle detachment, as if she is studying you from a distance. She wears rounded glasses and her eyes are warm without being soft. She speaks deliberately, unafraid of silence,” he writes. Each sentence in this essay is stark, each paragraph pairs devastation with earned optimism. No one in this story is comfortable, especially the reader, but that discomfort is a necessary precursor to change, fueled by what Danni and Donna bring to work every day: hope. —KS Kelley Engelbrecht | Chicago Magazine | March 4, 2025 | 6,193 words What happens in a world where machines are trained on stolen creativity? In this story for Chicago Magazine, Kelley Engelbrecht introduces us to Kim Van Deun, a fantasy illustrator who, a few years ago, began searching for a way to protect her work from generative AI tools that could produce images of anything in seconds. Her search led her to Ben Zhao, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago’s SAND Lab, where he and his team have developed protective tech—software called Glaze and Nightshade—that confuses and corrupts AI models that scrape and train on images without consent. “Take an image of a cat,” Engelbrecht explains. “Apply Nightshade to the image, and the AI model will see not a cat but something entirely different — perhaps a chair. Do this to enough images of cats, and gradually the model stops seeing cats and sees only chairs.” Engelbrecht’s profile of Zhao and the SAND Lab’s efforts to disrupt Big Tech highlights the bigger rift between AI companies and independent artists, but it also lingers on something more fundamental. At one point, when Engelbrecht asks Heather Zheng, Zhao’s wife and co-leader of the lab, about pushback to their work, she says, “I’d rather see Glaze and Nightshade as a way to tell the young generation that they have agency.” As a mother to an imaginative, artistic 6-year-old, I felt this on a deeper level. Engelbrecht weaves in a few quiet yet telling moments about children and their art, reminding us why it’s crucial for future generations to create from scratch, to build off a blank canvas, and to make something that’s entirely their own. Because even the most powerful algorithms are nothing without human imagination. —CLR Erika Hayasaki | Men’s Health | March 12, 2025 | 7,584 words Five years after COVID-19 first upended the world, as many as 20 million Americans and at least 400 million people worldwide are battling long COVID, a debilitating and misunderstood condition with few answers and no cure. Erika Hayasaki follows two men—Matthew Light, a pulmonologist, and Levi Henry, a CrossFit enthusiast—who, despite their different approaches to medicine, find themselves in the same boat. They continue to search for something, anything, that might make them feel like themselves again. Light’s shortness of breath persisted for months after getting COVID. “To be a pulmonologist struggling to breathe,” writes Hayasaki, “felt like a special kind of hell.” He developed chronic fatigue syndrome, and after a year of living with his symptoms, he asked himself: “Who is supposed to take care of long COVID patients?” He decided to be that doctor. He now leads a support group at UCHealth Medical Center of the Rockies in Colorado, where a growing community meets to commiserate and learn about potential new treatments without judgment. “They turn to each other,” writes Hayasaki, “because who better to turn to? Science does not yet have the answers.” Levi Henry, the former CrossFitter, had tried a number of experimental therapies—hyperbaric oxygen therapy, red light panels, lymphatic drainage massage, ice baths—before finding Light’s support group. Some treatments seem promising; a low dose of naltrexone has helped Light, for example, but others are risky and unproven. For both men, the search for relief is a kind of survival. In a world that’s moved on from the pandemic, and a new Trump administration decimating everything in its path, their support group is a space to share knowledge, and a lifeline. Hayasaki captures their frustration and resilience with nuance, showing what it’s really like to navigate an illness that remains a mystery. —CLR Piper French | Bolts, in partnership with Mother Jones | March 20, 2025 | 6,239 words A scene from Lawrence Wright’s recent New Yorker feature has stayed with me: A group of nuns visit Melissa, a death row inmate in Texas, on the day of her scheduled execution, only to find her in a cage—a literal cage, not just the metaphorical one of prison. In Piper French’s story, Chris Duncan, who has been on death row in Louisiana’s Angola prison since 1998, tells French that after years of incarceration, all that remained of him was a “body in a cage”—and that execution might be a mercy. The prison-as-cage metaphor is not new, but in French’s telling, its weight is visceral. Duncan was convicted of murdering his then-girlfriend’s toddler daughter. His case was built on now-debunked bite mark forensics, the expertise of discredited doctors, a jailhouse snitch’s faulty testimony, and a damning video never seen at trial. Add to that Louisiana’s history of prosecutorial misconduct—where more than 80 percent of death sentences were overturned between 1976 and 2015—and Duncan’s case becomes a stark reflection of a deeply flawed system. French details his case with care, while zooming out to track the evolution of the state’s legal system, including reforms in recent years that gave incarcerated people, even those on death row, new avenues to claim innocence. But since taking office last year, Governor Jeff Landry has aggressively worked to reinstate executions, reauthorized electrocution, and legalized the experimental method of suffocation by nitrogen gas. After a 15-year pause, Landry got his wish: This past week, Louisiana resumed executions by killing Jessie Hoffman, a man Duncan had grown close to. French’s reporting is urgent, revealing a justice system that gets it wrong far too often—and a governor more focused on sealing the cage than opening it. —CLR Brenna Ehrlich | Rolling Stone | March 29, 2025 | 6,782 words Brenna Ehrlich’s profile of the Reverend Jeff Hood is thick with tension from the opening sentence. Hood, “half metal roadie with his bald head and long, ZZ Top beard and quirky glasses, half classic priest,” ministers to men on death row. We meet him before dawn on the day that Emmanuel Littlejohn might be put to death at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, 30 years after he killed a man in a convenience store robbery. Littlejohn is one of Hood’s “guys,” men who are guilty of murder, rape, and sometimes both, men that Hood ministers to anyway, because he believes that everyone is worthy of love and compassion despite what they’ve done in life. Not all of the repulsive behavior in this piece is committed by the men behind bars: Hood has received death threats for his work, including from a 70-year-old man in a pickup truck while Hood was mowing his front lawn. Then there’s the torture committed by the state. The Pardon and Parole board had granted Littlejohn clemency weeks before his execution date, which put his life into the hands of Oklahoma governor Kevin Stitt. Stitt, who could mandate Littlejohn’s reprieve or death with a single phone call, was said to be praying on the decision—a performance that was still underway when they came to measure Littlejohn’s arms and legs for the straps and gauge his veins for the needle. (Is there anything more cruel than to dangle mercy in front of a man, just because you can?) This is an emotional read. But when you stick it out to the end as Hood does, you’ll find it to be a true testament to faith, hope, and love. —KS Kori Suzuki | High Country News | April 1, 2025 | 6,075 words In April 1943, 63-year-old James Wakasa was walking his dog near the edge of the Topaz Relocation Center, a Japanese American incarceration camp in the Utah desert, when he was shot and killed by a soldier in a guard tower. Fellow prisoners erected a stone and concrete monument in Wakasa’s honor. Decades later, Nancy Ukai, a researcher in Berkeley whose parents had also been incarcerated at Topaz, began to learn more about Wakasa’s story, and that the Roosevelt administration had ordered the monument to be destroyed. Two archaeologists read Ukai’s research, visited Topaz, and—to their surprise—stumbled upon the monument, buried in the ground. But what followed wasn’t a triumphant rediscovery, as Kori Suzuki reports, but an example of how heritage and historical memory can be mishandled. The museum entrusted with preserving Topaz excavated the monument without involving any descendants of those imprisoned there. “In the museum’s actions, [Ukai] saw the same patterns of violence emerging,” writes Suzuki, violence in the form of silence and erasure. Suzuki’s storytelling is quiet and clear-eyed, letting the weight of history press through each sentence. More than 80 years later, Topaz descendants still seek answers about the discovery and excavation of the monument, and still fight for dignity and remembrance. This story isn’t just about an unearthed piece of stone—it’s a mirror and a warning, reminding us that the powerful are more often interested in rewriting history than reckoning with it. —CLR Chelsea Kirk | n+1 | April 7, 2025 | 3,990 words As the Eaton and Palisades wildfires tore through Southern California, destroying neighborhoods and displacing tens of thousands of people, landlords moved swiftly to capitalize on disaster. In this n+1 essay, tenant organizer Chelsea Kirk writes from inside that moment: “A two-bedroom apartment on Montana Avenue was listed for $3,595 on January 7. By the next day, the price had jumped 25 percent to $4,495. By January 9, it climbed another 33 percent, reaching $5,995.” Watching Zillow rental prices surge in real time, Kirk created an open-access Google spreadsheet to track and collect instances of price gouging. The spreadsheet went viral, the number of listings exploded, and what began as one individual’s spontaneous response quickly evolved into a larger act of resistance. Kirk mobilized a network of activists, coders, urban planners, and people who simply wanted to help. “The spreadsheet taps into the anger of people who may never set foot in a tenant union meeting, but who still feel the urgency,” writes Kirk. “This crisis is reaching people who haven’t been part of the fight before.” Despite thousands of documented cases, officials have done almost nothing to protect tenants or hold exploitative landlords and realtors accountable. (Only 14 violators have been charged so far, which is less than 1 percent of total cases.) Meanwhile, the rent gouging continues. But Kirk’s essay is more than an indictment of government inaction and landlord greed; it’s a testament to the power of collective action in a time of layered crises. “What landlords fear is that we might imagine something better: a world where housing isn’t a commodity at all, a world without landlords,” she writes. This is a vision of what’s possible when ordinary people start to imagine something different—and work together to make it real. —CLR Maddy Crowell | Harper’s Magazine | April 21, 2025 | 5,486 words Last year, Harper’s ran a feature about people grappling with systemic, sometimes incapacitating maladies. The afflicted blame the invisible toxins of modernity—electromagnetic frequencies, chemicals, additives—but society sees them as hypochondriacs or crackpots. Maddy Crowell’s piece in the newest issue of Harper’s acts as a bookend of sorts to that story: another case of hardship compounded by dismissal. Frank Vera III worked at George Air Force Base in the 1970s, where he interacted with what we now know are carcinogenic substances; he also claims to have been exposed to radioactive waste, and began exhibiting symptoms that ended his military career. Yet no one would validate his tale, or his suffering. Decades later, Vera began posting on Facebook, where he attracted a tribe of others who worked at the same base and claimed similar health troubles. Enter Crowell—a curious reporter who, to Vera, represented something more like a savior. As Crowell begins to investigate the alleged phenomenon, she finds herself examining the meta-phenomenon of conspiratorial thinking. Vera’s medical troubles are undeniable; so is the fact that the US military has worked with toxic materials. However, Vera’s crusade had also led him onto shakier ground, and his passion was now mixed with paranoia. “The more we spoke, the more confused I became,” Crowell writes. “Many of his most impassioned beliefs seemed wildly incoherent. But Frank’s emotional and physical pain was undeniable. He cried several times. And even if he lacked a smoking gun, he had enough evidence to indicate that the Air Force wasn’t being totally forthright about whatever had been going on at George.” There are no easy answers here. There’s plenty of stonewalling, though, and bureaucracy that seems designed to thwart accountability. So, perhaps unsurprisingly, Crowell is unable to bring her investigation to a satisfying end. But that’s also the only possible outcome here, if you think about it. After all, it’s only wrong if you get caught. And the more power you have, the unlikelier that is. —PR Mariana Serapicos | Electric Literature | April 24, 2025 | 3,935 words My parents, who are in their mid-70s, are preparing to sell the house they’ve lived in for nearly 50 years. I’ve been scanning my mind for the memories we’ve made in that home. In many of them, my dad is tinkering with something—up a ladder, barefoot, hammering on the siding; searching for a tool in the garage; changing the oil in his car. He is a fixer for life, eternally excited about a piece of wood, but these days, I see him resting on the couch a lot more. Reading Mariana Serapicos’s tribute to her own father, it’s hard not to think about my dad getting older. Serapicos’s father got sick when she was a child, diagnosed with ALS at a time when not many people were aware of the disease. Her descriptions of watching his health deteriorate are tough. But her descriptions of his love for his family, and a life of joy despite hardship, are ultimately what I take away from this piece. The first (and last) time she sees her dad in the hospital, they communicate through letters and sentences on a piece of cardboard. “We talked about plain things because everything else was too big, because plainness is the fabric of life,” she writes. This line encapsulates what I love about this essay. She captures everyday details—his Birkenstocks, their days at the pool, the way she danced on his feet and combed his oily hair—that celebrate a hardworking and joyful man who lived fully. Serapicos leaves us with a moving portrait not of decline, but of presence. —CLR Bobbie Johnson | Wired | May 1, 2025 | 3,848 words I’ve worked remotely for almost 15 years, well before logging in from the kitchen or couch became mainstream. There’s a lot you can glean about your coworkers just by being online with them over time. You build rapport, deep respect, and above all, trust. That’s why Bobbie Johnson’s Wired piece about how North Korea used American shills to put fake workers inside over 300 US companies yanked my neck on a chain. Christina Chapman was a shill. Once a worker landed a job, she housed and maintained the fake’s laptop, received their pay, took a cut, and wired the rest of the money to North Korea. Before the law caught up to her, she ran a laptop farm from her Arizona home with dozens of computers linked to different workers. Several people in the US have been charged, and these cases are winding their way through the courts. But where did it all begin? In North Korea, all roads lead to the country’s dictator, Kim Jong Un. Kim is a gaming enthusiast secretly educated in Switzerland, and he made investing in IT a top priority after taking over from his father in 2011. Computer science courses now run in schools, and the most promising students are taught hacking techniques and foreign languages. They’re allowed a glimmer of freedom in access to the actual internet so that they can excel as operatives for the state. Johnson surveys the history of North Korean hacking success, and the surprising (and sad) communal conditions under which operatives work today, all to pad Kim’s pocket. This piece puts you on the edge of your seat for the audacity of the cybercrime alone. It takes a hilarious turn when Johnson rides along with a recruiter, coming face to face with more than one North Korean operative applying for, and in one case, spectacularly failing to land a lucrative American job. It’s a scene you won’t want to miss. —KS Jason Motlagh | Rolling Stone | April 27, 2025 | 6,716 words In a bid to emulate Portugal and France, where “nuanced approaches prioritizing health care over punishment have curtailed overdoses and public drug use,” Oregon decriminalized possession of small amounts of hard drugs like fentanyl and meth in 2020. The state redirected hundreds of millions of dollars earmarked for enforcement and incarceration toward treatment and harm reduction. It all seemed reasonable in theory, but Mexican drug cartels took full advantage. They flooded the US with fentanyl, which forced the price down, making it accessible for as little as $1 per pill. Then came the pandemic, where isolation, despair, and the cheap, plentiful supply became a horrific combination. “Portland became a honeypot for local and out-of-state addicts to score cheap dope and use it freely,” writes Jason Motlagh for Rolling Stone. After the state repealed decriminalization in 2024, Motlagh visited Portland to witness the aftermath. His careful reporting puts him face to face with people on all sides of the drug crisis: He talks to a hotel owner and the local district attorney; he shadows treatment workers and harm reduction volunteers on their rounds; he witnesses a man brought back from the brink of overdose with four naloxone injections; he gets to know addicts as they cycle through rock bottom and relapse. So how’s it going? Today, naloxone is more readily available on the street. Overdoses are down slightly with a less potent supply. (Some say the cartels are trying to keep their customers alive longer.) While at times this was a very difficult read, it was plain to see that in Portland, there is something other than fentanyl available in large supply—hope. —KS Sarah Miller | n+1 | May 20, 2025 | 8,216 words Not so long ago, Sarah Miller was Not Doing Well. Like, Not Doing Well at an existential, nearly cellular level. She despaired about the world and its fate, about her own pessimisim, about her role in the world. She also had no idea how to navigate her despair, let alone resolve it, until she decided—with no small amount of misgiving—that ayahuasca was worth a shot. So: off to Peru! In the 1,500 words it takes for Miller to reach the center where she’ll journey to her own center, you get a very clear sense that you are in very good hands. Not only does she wield a gratifyingly caustic sense of humor, but she has the rare gift of bidirectional analysis; she is both intensely self-aware and intensely judgmental, leveling the same withering gaze inward and outward. (Let me be clear: This is a compliment. No one likes everybody. The least you can do is own your reasoning.) And when she arrives, all these traits combine to create a psychedelia of their own. There’s the pre-trip purgation, of course. The seven (seven!) ayahuasca experiences, each of which manages to disappoint or even re-traumatize Miller in some novel way. The other people, who she renders with a keen meanness, or possibly a mean keenness. Yet, none of this feels like punching down, or self-absorption, or any of the other pitfalls that lurk in a piece like this. It’s not that she hates, it’s that she hurts. Does the ayahuasca care? It does not. Instead, it pushes her through the darkness, again and again. “My life was a selfish joke,” she writes of the reality that consumed her during her sixth trip. “My desire to express myself was risible. I had come here to find hope but what I found instead was the definitive end of it.” The theme of the latest issue of n+1 is Harsh Realm, and this very unfunny realization in the midst of a very funny piece makes clear that, for most of us, the harshest realm of all is the doubt that lurks inside us. —PR Andy Greenberg | Wired | May 22, 2025 | 12,182 words Over the past week, I shared so many stories about psychedelics in a group chat that a friend asked me if I had a new hobby she should know about. I only get high on narrative journalism, maaaaan, and Andy Greenberg’s piece about Akasha Song’s DMT empire is a trip. (It also lasts longer than the average DMT experience, and causes little to no ego death.) Song fell in love with LSD in high school, back when he was named Joseph Clements; 20 years later, he discovered the mind-altering joys of dimethyltryptamine. First he learned to make the drug, extracting it from a tree bark that’s legal to buy. Then he started selling it to friends. Then he found the dark web and started selling more. A lot more. His operation grew. He laundered the money through crypto. He moved from Colorado to Texas to Northern California, expanding all the while—until, inevitably, it all came crashing down. Greenberg specializes in this sort of story, having profiled McDonald’s ice-cream machine hackers, swatting teenagers, white-hat hackers, and more, and he’s in characteristically fine form here. It helps that Song landed on his feet, and shared a trove of the detail (and proof) that’s so crucial to that cinematic feel. You’re reading Greenberg’s words, but you’re in Song’s world, from the first tab to the last chat. —PR Katya Apekina | Alta Journal | June 3, 2025 | 1,561 words A mile from our home marks the burn line from a wildfire that ignited on a scorching day in May and consumed 4,000 hectares within hours, urged on by gusting south winds. Pines, poplars, and skinny ash trees are dead standing in that eerie, blackened landscape. The trees and the brush will grow back. Two people on our small peninsula did not make it out in time. This is the worst wildfire season in my province’s history and it’s only the beginning of June. I’ve read and heard many wildfire stories over the years; a US colleague used to live through the summers with a “go” bag packed with essentials and family treasures, should the worst come to pass and threaten their home. I never really understood what that meant until I read The Great Displacement by Jake Bittle, in which he reports on climate change-induced migration, wildfire being one cause. (It’s a terrific, eye-opening book, full of personal stories. You should check it out.) Ever since, I’ve been compelled to read every wildfire story I find. That’s why Katya Apekina’s account of the Palisades and Eaton Fires for Alta Journal caught my attention. The morning of January 7, 2025, dawns like an ordinary Tuesday. The Santa Ana winds feel a little spooky, a little exciting for Apekina, the “L.A. version of a snowstorm.” But then the winds pick up. The fire, which had started 20 miles away, roars closer. The tension in this essay grows and develops like a fully-fledged character as she recounts a surreal scene: her husband reading “a biography of J. Edgar Hoover by candlelight as the fire rages in the windows behind him.” Soon, the air turns acrid with dense smoke. It tastes toxic. People are losing their houses as the fire advances. They are dying. Paper artifacts of lives lived float to earth the following day, having escaped the flames. “Pages from the Bible, or Alcoholics Anonymous literature, or old encyclopedias—thin pages that traveled downwind for several miles—drifted into people’s yards,” she writes in the aftermath, a period in which she questions her future in Los Angeles and how to live, moment to moment, while processing the catastrophe. “I’m in a state of hysterical terror. I want to go home. This is not my home.” As Apekina suggests, it may be time for many of us to reconsider what home really means. If you can make a space for home in your heart, at least you can take it with you when you have to flee. —KS Archie Bland | The Guardian | May 24, 2025 | 7,053 words At seven weeks old, Max stopped breathing. His father, Guardian journalist Archie Bland, recounts what followed with harrowing clarity: performing CPR on his infant son, the frantic ambulance ride, an insect crawling “along a fluorescent light,” each detail etched into his trauma-heightened memory. Two years on, Max lives with cerebral palsy, the result of oxygen deprivation during a likely SIDS event. Bland writes not just to honor his son—“already a thousand times more interesting than anyone I’ve ever met”—but to hold a mirror up to himself. He examines the quiet entitlement of his life before (“As a white man named Archibald, I always suspected I was missing something about the impact of privilege”) and the raw rage he feels parenting a disabled child in a world full of “absolute doughnuts,” people who compare Max’s condition to a child’s squint or ask no questions at all. Bland’s writing is funny, furious, and brutally honest. “I understand things about myself and the world now that I can’t wish I didn’t know,” he writes, no longer a “genial ignoramus.” Max himself brings so much joy, and Bland wants us to know him not for what he lacks but for everything he is. After reading, listen to Bland’s interview on Today in Focus. You’ll hear Max laugh, and it’s beautiful. —CW Suzy Hansen | New York | June 16, 2025 | 10,071 words Finally. That was my first thought when I finished reading Suzy Hansen’s damning cover story detailing Israel’s violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza. These violations have been repeated and flagrant, and they have been documented by brave Palestinian journalists and civilians, as well as NGOs, UN agencies, and visiting medical providers. Indeed, Hansen’s feature isn’t an investigation, because an investigation wasn’t necessary—mountains of evidence of Israel’s crimes were readily available. What took so long for a writer at a legacy media publication in the West to muster that evidence and say what is so plainly true? Hansen has an answer, because her essential piece is also about the international complicity that has allowed Israel to kill, terrorize, and humiliate its targets unchecked. Chief among Israel’s aiders and abettors was the Biden administration, building on a post-9/11 legacy of normalizing humanitarian abuses; its successor is no better. “As the theologian Abraham Joshua Heschel said, in a free society, ‘few are guilty, all are responsible.’ This includes many institutions outside government, like the mainstream media,” Hansen writes. “[W]estern newspapers and networks still faithfully print Israeli talking points, excuses, and outright lies.” The cumulative effect of this rampant cruelty and complicity is, of course, mass suffering, but it also signals the ultimate failure of a body of law established over the last century to prevent exactly that. This failure was not inevitable. Power and prejudice are to blame. Hansen hopes there is something to salvage here, a shared standard of human decency. But I’m doubtful, and I’m not alone. “Elite impunity is the sole remaining area of bipartisan consensus,” Matt Duss, Bernie Sanders’s former foreign-policy chief and the executive vice-president of the Center for International Policy, tells Hansen. “They understand that whatever they do, it’s not going to really hurt them because, you know, Donald Rumsfeld died in his bed.” —SD Alyssa Roenigk | ESPN | June 20, 2025 | 4,016 words My husband’s cousin and her family lost their home in the Eaton Fire. Nothing was salvageable. While I was putting together a care package for them, I would look at an item in a store and wonder, “Do they already have this?” Then I’d remember: They don’t have anything. This happened again and again, as my brain struggled to grasp the fact and meaning of total loss. Here, Alyssa Roenigk spends time with students at Altadena’s John Muir High School, where unthinkable loss is nearly endemic: One in four kids at Muir lost their homes or were displaced by the fire. Roenigk gracefully timestamps sections of her piece with the number of days since the fire began, echoing the way many Altadenans now think: “Dates are no longer defined by a calendar but instead by how much time has passed since that fateful Tuesday.” Nine days after the fire, Muir senior Jasmine Collins is living in a motel with her mother and siblings; all of their worldly possessions now fit into their truck. Fifty days after the fire, someone breaks into the truck and steals everything. This is one of many details Roenigk musters to remind her readers that disaster has a long, painful, and unpredictable tail. “Money from online fundraisers is drying up,” she writes. “Donation centers are packing up and closing. The rebuilding process is slow.” People are leaving Altadena, too, including some whose families have been there for generations. Those who remain must adjust to a new normal. “If we’re choosing to stay,” one of Roenigk’s subjects says, “then we’re going to have to embrace that it’s never going to be the same again.” There is beauty, of course, in rising from the ashes. But Roenigk’s story shows that there is also beauty in making space for grief. In a memorable scene, Jasmine’s water polo coach asks how she’s doing after a game that takes place just 16 days after the fire: “Jasmine looks up. ‘I . . . ’ She stops. Her eyes fill with tears. She smiles and forms a heart with her hands.” —SD Lewis Hyde | Harper’s Magazine | June 18, 2025 | 6,655 words Frequent readers of our curation have probably sussed out that different editors have different pet topics. Every Friday, one Longreads spouse tries to match each Top 5 pick to an editor, just from reading the headlines. (Results vary.) I have my own, but reading Lewis Hyde’s piece this week added another to the list: deep time. The fact that change happens on a scale that humans simply can’t register continues to light up the wonder center in my brain. In the past, this has happened with a 2023 Lachlan Summers Aeon story about how Mexico City residents are “stranded” in time; now, it’s Hyde’s exploration of how Charles Lyell first envisioned deep time, and how Charles Darwin rested his most famous theory on it. Species evolve, as Carolyn reminded us recently, in fits and starts, in a way that’s nearly impossible for humans to witness. Increasingly, though, that work is being undone on a scale that’s tragically perceptible. “Eleven thousand years of survival versus a few decades of decline: it may not be clear how we are to reckon with spans of time so utterly out of proportion with one another,” Hyde writes, “but that is now the task at hand as more species decline or go extinct.” Frankly, I wrestled with whether to include any quote from the piece in this blurb, since it just makes me want to share a half-dozen others. I read this story with my jaw half-open, as I always do when a writer manages to communicate science’s most incomprehensible truths. It’s the kind of writing that sends me to the bookstore, that gets my note-taking hand twitching, that makes my brain feel hungry for more. It might just do the same for you. —PR Aaron Parsley | Texas Monthly | July 10, 2025 | 4,383 words Imagine being at your family house on the Guadalupe River in Texas, ready to enjoy some July Fourth summer fun. Now imagine waking in the wee hours to discover that flash flood waters have trapped you in the house. Your elderly dad and your partner are there. Your sister and brother-in-law are there too, along with their two children, a daughter, age 4, and a son, 20 months old. It’s dark. The water is at the deck, which is 20 feet off the ground. The water is moving fast and filled with debris and it’s rising. Window glass shatters as the river invades the house. There is nowhere to evacuate to. You feel the room shift and tilt as the house is lifted off the foundation and seconds later is torn apart. This is the scene Aaron Parsley describes in his harrowing and unforgettable first-person account of the flash flooding in Kerr County, Texas. Parsley’s writing is so taut and tense and immediate that time slowed, and then stopped as I read this piece. This is a story I’ll always remember. It put my heart in my throat as I choked back sobs, bereft for this family and their tragedy. “Alissa managed to keep both kids on the countertop, one hand on each, still trying to reassure them,” he writes. “As the house came undone, she grabbed one in each arm. This is the part that will forever haunt me.” This piece doesn’t concern itself with second-guessing weather forecasts, warnings, or the timeliness of the emergency response. Those facts are important, of course, but here, they’re far beside the point. Given the catastrophic loss Parsley and his family suffered, does anything else really matter? —KS John Woodrow Cox, Sarah Blaskey, and Matt McClain | The Washington Post | June 21, 2025 | 5,553 words There’s a moment in this piece I’ve been thinking about ever since I read it. Otto Vargas, a farmhand from Guatemala, asks his new boss, JJ Fricken, whether he has other employees who work his land in Colorado. Fricken hears the question through an earbud that translates in real time—the men don’t speak the same language, so this is how they communicate. Fricken points at himself, then at Vargas. “Just you and me,” he says. The scene, evoking both vulnerability and solidarity, is a succinct illustration of the wider story, which details how the two men’s fates came to be intertwined. The federal government had promised Fricken a $200,000 grant to hire a worker from Latin America, who would be given an H-2A visa. “In a place where local, legal help was nearly impossible to keep, the extra worker would give him the freedom to handle more jobs and invest in his own equipment,” the authors explain. “It was an opportunity that could transform his family’s future.” Vargas’s future was on the line too: “He’d prayed that he’d get a job interview, and when he did, he prayed he’d do well, and when he did, he prayed he’d receive an offer, and when he did, he prayed the United States would let him come.” Then the Trump administration, despite boasting about its love for American farmers, froze the grant money. Suddenly, Fricken was in debt, and while Vargas was able to come to Colorado, it wasn’t clear how long his job would last. To survive the administration’s cuts and cruelty, a Trump voter and an immigrant needed each other. What a terrible, beautiful thought. —SD Liam Taylor | 1843 Magazine | July 24, 2025 | 6,235 words At the risk of sounding idiotically obvious, mining is an extractive process—for those doing the mining as well as the resources being mined. Workers can meet their doom suddenly (collapse, fall, explosion), or after many years (lung disease), but to escape unscathed feels almost miraculous. No such miracles awaited many of the men who flocked to South Africa’s Buffelsfontein mine after it closed in 2013. This was mining minus any illusion of safety; any gold left was deeper underground and farther from entry shafts than ever before, requiring “zama-zamas,” or illegal miners, to live hundreds of meters below the surface for months at a time. And while some zama-zamas came on their own, others arrived under false pretenses or even duress, forced by gangs who controlled the access points. What was already difficult and dangerous became even more so last year, when the South African police began blocking both food supplies going into Buffels and the rope crews who helped zama-zamas get out. Many starved. Many died. Even when people were allowed to leave, they were arrested, with migrants from neighboring countries being held without bail. Liam Taylor’s feature about the tragedy doesn’t shy away from the horrific conditions that led to illegal mining, nor from the fact that blame lay at multiple feet: police, famo gangs, mine owners, the government, and the long shadows of colonialism and apartheid. It’s always sobering to learn of a human-rights disaster. All the more reason that journalism like this—nimble reporting, unaffected prose, and the sole purpose of making sure the world knows—is so crucial. —PR Hannah S. Palmer | Earth Island Journal | Summer 2025 | 3,457 words I recently moved inland from the San Francisco Bay Area, and 90-degree-plus days are now the norm. While it’ll take time to get used to the heat, I love how often we’ve gone swimming this summer. For $6 a visit, we can enjoy two massive sparkling pools and a waterslide in a leafy park, supervised by a rotating team of lifeguards. The quick bike ride to this public pool was one reason we bought our house—and it’s made me think a lot about recreational access to water: pools, lakes, beaches, and other places to play and cool off. In this excerpt from her new book, The Pool is Closed: Segregation, Summertime, and the Search for a Place to Swim, Hannah S. Palmer reflects on lost Southern waters, retracing the history of integration in the South and how it led to the abandonment of public pools and other facilities. “When we talk about water, we’re talking about race and class,” she writes. Wondering where her young sons can learn how to swim, Palmer visits public pools in Atlanta and creeks and lakes in the region: “I drove all over Georgia investigating places where people used to swim that faded from the map after integration: pools filled, lakes drained, beaches sliced into private properties.” When white people rebuilt their own private versions of these places, these spaces were lost to everyone else, particularly Black communities. Her reflections on pools ripple outward: What she discovers also applies to parks, schools, libraries, transit. “Life is not so different from what happens when we swim in public,” she writes. This piece is a compelling introduction to her research on water and public space, as well as parenting in a time of environmental crisis. —CLR Tony Ho Tran | Slate | August 13, 2025 | 5,565 words In April, as the US marked 50 years since the end of the Vietnam War and a flood of anniversary projects rolled across the journalism plains, Tony Ho Tran was on the Vietnam coast with his parents and brother. This wasn’t a voyage of commemoration, but a long-delayed trip that just happened to coincide with the milestone. Still, coincidence means little when you return to the place that made you and then blew apart. The backdrop of the celebration heightens the usual tensions of a family vacation: Tran’s father goes full Dad Mode by telling everyone he meets in Hanoi that he’d served in the South Vietnamese army; Tran’s mother insists on repeating everything Tran and his brother say to locals, as though their Vietnamese is indecipherable. Ultimately, though, the enormity of the occasion snuffs out any internecine squabbles. Sharing a beer with his dad on Hạ Long Bay, Tran fills in gaps of the man’s life he’d never even known were there, and the travelogue gives way to something altogether more lyrical, something that Tran has been moving toward all along. “Returning, I realize now, was never going to answer any questions or heal us,” he writes. “Returning gives shape to memory. It allows us to feel the ragged trenches of its scars, map the landscape it creates—and that, in turn, changes us. But the past will always be with us: in the stories we tell strangers, the old enemies we welcome back, and the fights we have with those we love.” We are the strangers here, and Tran’s family story—and, particularly, its arresting final image—will stay with you for some time. —PR Eric McHenry | The American Scholar | August 14, 2025 | 3,122 words On one hand, the word “folklore” will never lose its ability to make me feel like a bored, fidgety kid. It sounds like field trips to one-room schoolhouses. But on the other hand, the word also thrums with enormous power—the same power that makes the blues the most potent artform born on American soil. The Mississippi Delta isn’t terminus in this case, but origin: The stories and tropes that made their way into the music proliferated through this country’s very sensibility, and through every other mode of expression that it spawned. And with that much embedded folklore, there’s always another discovery lurking, another path to tread from song to song, another history to uncover. Eric McHenry’s investigation for The American Scholar exercises that sonic sleuthing in journalistic form, following the character of “the Mercy Man” back through the decades all the way to its seeming genesis. It’s a fascinating investigation, whether or not you’re familiar with Alan Lomax’s famed field recordings or even the blues at all. McHenry dives into the levee camp holler, a plaintive song form born when Black men of the late 19th and early 20th century joined work crews controlled by viciously racist contractors and featuring conditions that seemed nearly indistinguishable from slavery itself. After tracing various renditions of a story in which a contractor known as Mr. Charlie kills an animal welfare officer, McHenry finally finds a 1909 incident that seems to explain everything; from there, he re-expands his search, adding vital texture to the event and sketching a stunning depiction of what inequality really looked like at the time. (Spoiler: It looks like a whole lot of Mr. Charlies.) This is a story about American history, but it’s also a story about how we cope with the unspeakable, and about how art can grow from the abject. And if you’re anything like me, it’ll remind you that the word “folklore” isn’t so boring after all. —PR Viola Zhou | Rest of World | September 2, 2025 | 4,472 words Something happened to me last year that I’ve yet to fully unpack. I was doing sit-ups when, suddenly, the left side of my body was overtaken by tingling. A colorful corona bloomed in my left eye. I found it hard to speak. My wife drove me to the emergency room. There was a cardiology investigation. Then there were others. I got a neurologist, and then a gastroenterologist. I started getting monthly blood tests. Doctors scanned my brain and tested my nerves. Each test showed me to be in good health. And yet symptoms of something have persisted. Where I live, family doctors are hard to come by, so I’ve been required to piece together my own care. My wife provides tremendous emotional support, but we’re not all so fortunate. Where, then, should we look for solace? Viola Zhou’s mother has lived with chronic kidney problems for two decades. As China’s aging population puts increased pressure on the nation’s healthcare infrastructure, Zhou’s mother has seen her marriage fracture and her daughter leave the country. In her isolation, she has turned to DeepSeek, an AI-powered chatbot, for medical guidance, tasking it with interpreting her medical records, changing her diet, and reducing her immunosuppressant dose. She warmly thanks the chatbot, and it responds in kind. Zhou brings her mother’s chat records to specialists, who point out the errors in Dr. DeepSeek’s responses. And yet Zhou’s mother dismisses the shortcomings. “DeepSeek is more humane,” she tells Zhou. “Doctors are more like machines.” These days, there is no shortage of stories about people in crisis who turn to AI for support, sometimes to perilous ends. Zhou’s feature reminds us that such stories are symptoms—of technological limits, isolation, and dysfunctional healthcare systems. —BF Ivy Knight | Oxford American | August 6, 2025 | 3,266 words Earlier this week, I watched a video of people on a street outside London’s Royal Courts of Justice, moving barriers away from a wall to uncover a Banksy mural. The artwork—depicting a judge using a gavel to strike a protester who holds a blood-spattered sign—is likely a commentary on the recent mass arrests at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. There’s been a lot of online chatter about it: the court’s swift cover-up, the legal implications for altering a listed building, and whether the artwork was genuine, which Banksy confirmed on Instagram. This question of authenticity was fresh in my mind after reading Ivy Knight’s Oxford American piece about Boy on a Life Preserver Swing, one of the murals Banksy left behind in New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina. Knight tells a delightful story about an unlikely trio—a dump truck driver, a real estate developer, and an art conservator—who come together to save the piece. Originally painted on the exterior wall of a biker bar, the mural was defaced with red spray paint, then reduced to rubble when the building was demolished. Ronnie Fredericks, the truck driver, salvaged the cinderblocks and stored them for years until he stumbled upon an opportunity with Sean Cummings, an art-loving hotelier, to bring the work back to life. “Joy” is not a word I usually associate with Banksy, but I felt it while reading Knight’s account of the restoration effort, and the science behind the careful process. (“She tried every removal method in her arsenal,” Knight writes of Elise Grenier, the art conservator challenged with the task, “but she could find no way to remove spray paint from spray paint.”) The trio’s shared curiosity and appreciation for the art is palpable, and as I watched the clip of Londoners removing security barriers to glimpse Banksy’s latest critique, I felt a similar sense of collective awe and empowerment. Together, these interactions with both murals speak to Banksy’s enduring role as a chronicler of human struggle and resilience, and the power of public art, even—or, perhaps, especially—in the face of erasure and suppression. —CLR Gordy Megroz | National Geographic | September 16, 2025 | 2,432 words* Nature has left me awestruck time and time again: whether gazing at the Big Sur coastline from a mountaintop monastery, watching the Colorado River carve a sharp U-turn at Dead Horse Point in Utah, or standing where Kīlauea’s lava meets the sea on Hawaii’s Big Island. A few years ago, Henry Wismayer’s essay on the science of awe made me wonder what, exactly, stirs such emotion. This question reemerged for me as I read Gordy Megroz’s National Geographic profile of Kai Xu, a 23-year-old mountain-loving mathematician who set out to measure this feeling. On a visit to California’s Eastern Sierra region, Xu was wowed by the sight of Mount Tom. At 13,652 feet, it’s far shorter than Mount Everest, the world’s tallest peak at 29,032 feet, but Xu found Mount Tom’s presence just as extraordinary. Are there attributes other than height that make a mountain great? Could awe be quantified? “He had never laid eyes on the Himalaya or the Andes or any of the world’s largest mountains,” writes Megroz, “but he couldn’t have been more impressed if he had.” Xu invented a new formula to calculate grandeur, factoring in a mountain’s height above its surroundings and the steepness of its rise to produce a single number called “jut”—a measure of how dramatically a peak thrusts into the sky. Math lovers will enjoy the story’s nerdy bent, but what stays with me most is Megroz’s ability to balance technical detail with emotional resonance. He never loses sight of the human story—of a bright, curious young man who sees the world in a new way, and challenges us to do the same. —CLR * requires an email address to read Alice Hines | New York | September 24, 2025 | 5,189 words A couple of stories about cloned animals have made it into our Top 5 in recent memory—specifically, polo ponies and dogs. But ponies and dogs aren’t exactly rare. What happens when someone uses cloning to propagate a species thousands of miles from its natural home? Even weirder, what happens when they use biotech to de-extinct a species—or create one that doesn’t exist? Enter Montana Mountain King, a Marco Polo argali who was born not in Central Asia, where all the spiral-horned ruminants live, but in (duh) Montana, where rancher Jack Schubarth had implanted cloned argali embryos into his pneumonia-prone sheep. That Schubarth managed this feat of husbandry was a miracle unto itself; had he done it legally, rather than sending his son to smuggle a strip of argali hide back from Kyrgyzstan, he’d likely be a hero of the conservation movement. Instead, he got six months in federal prison. The story of Schubarth and MMK is a fascinating one, even before ketamine and rectal probes make an appearance, but it’s also just the beginning. Alice Hines expands the scope from Schubarth’s operation to a thriving, if ethically ambiguous, animal biohacking industry. One company has seemingly revived the dire wolf and has its sight set on the dodo; another wants to breed unicorns and dragons. (All together, now: What could go wrong?) Throughout, Hines melds story and science with a deft touch, and turns what might otherwise be the tale of a single resourceful rancher into a more troubling look at a future that’s roaring toward us. The bleating edge of science, indeed. —PR Nicholas Hune-Brown | The Local | September 25, 2025 | 6,315 words Speight Rasees, a 2-year-old bay filly, suffered a catastrophic breakdown at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, in November 2024, crashing to the turf in an “awful tangle of limbs.” Jason Hoyte, the jockey, broke his shoulder in the accident, but Speight Rasees was not so lucky: She was euthanized by lethal injection. As Nicholas Hune-Brown reports for The Local, Speight Rasees was one of 10 horses to die after breakdowns at Woodbine in a two-month period in 2024, with several more injured. Proponents say horses receive the care and treatment of elite athletes. Critics charge that the injuries and deaths are proof that the sport needs to end. Given that the Ontario government props up racing with slot machine revenue because wagering alone is not enough to fund purses, the spate of carnage raises hard questions about precisely what the government is subsidizing. “That puts horse racing in a position that’s uncomfortable to defend,” writes Hune-Brown. “Each day at the track, hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money are paid out to the owners of racehorses, a large percentage of which is government subsidy.” Horses break down and death is inevitable in racing. Hune-Brown worked at the track as a teen and, while reporting, even placed a $2 bet on a horse called Little Teddy. Despite rising to his feet “unconsciously along with the rest of the roaring crowd, a puppet on a string as the horses pounded their way down the homestretch,” Hune-Brown wears no rose-colored glasses of nostalgia. This piece is deeply sourced. He spoke to industry workers, horse owners, animal welfare activists, and Michael Copeland, CEO of Woodbine Entertainment Group. Hune-Brown urges us to take the reins, to take a close look at the horse racing industry and ask some questions: Who’s winning and who’s losing, and most importantly, why does Ontario choose to pay the price? —KS Robert Sanchez | 5280 | October 2, 2025 | 4,765 words I recently attended the funeral of my uncle, who suffered a severe cervical fracture after a fall. His health had rapidly deteriorated over the years. After being admitted to the hospital, he was awake and alert, but by the next morning, he was gone. On the day of his burial, I was struck by the orderliness of the military ceremony: the precise folding of the American flag handed to his wife; the Army vets in silent procession, lifting and firing their rifles in unison; the swift, almost ritualistic way a bulldozer covered his casket and smoothed the earth. This planned, meditative efficiency was a stark contrast to the suddenness of his death. It left me thinking about how we die, and what—if anything—we can control when our time comes. Nearly 10 years ago, Colorado voters passed the End of Life Options Act, legalizing medical aid in dying for terminally ill adults who meet specific criteria. Since then, about 1,100 people in the state have chosen this path. For 5280, Robert Sanchez spent the summer learning about this option through Denver Health’s Medical Aid in Dying clinic. Who is eligible? (A person of “sound mind” with six months or less to live.) Where can an “ingestion” take place? (Either a family’s home or the home of someone volunteering their property, since hospitals and hospices don’t permit the practice.) Sanchez was invited to witness families in their most intimate and vulnerable moments. There’s Alan, a man with aggressive lung cancer, who posed for a final family photo before taking his last drink. And there’s Astrid, a woman with ALS who requested to expedite the process to end her suffering. Sanchez captures tough scenes, including a moment when Astrid uses all her strength to reach for the doctor’s syringe to initiate the procedure (a patient must administer the dose themself). Sanchez writes with compassion and curiosity, observing without intrusion, and letting the moments unravel. Through these stories, he invites us to wrestle with this question: “How much control should we have over the terms of our own deaths?” The clinic’s director, a former ER doctor, tells him that “[a]ll stories need to have an ending, and we want our stories to matter.” I keep thinking about my uncle—and how, if given the chance, he would have shaped his own ending. —CLR John Woodrow Cox | The Washington Post | October 14, 2025 | 4,630 words It’s hard to watch videos of ICE agents snatching people in broad daylight across the US. They surface again and again in all of my feeds, each one blurring into the next. Most of the time, I can’t finish them. It’s easier to look away. Which is exactly why we need more pieces like this one: a thoughtful, deeply reported narrative that makes immigration and mass deportation feel less abstract. For The Washington Post, John Woodrow Cox writes about “H,” an Afghan man who supported the US during the war in Afghanistan. After arriving here through the humanitarian parole program, he applied for asylum and built a life—and raised two US-born kids—with his wife. But the Trump administration has since terminated the protections that allow Afghans like H to stay, with one Homeland Security staffer calling him an “unvetted alien from a high threat country.” H is anything but. He and his wife are law-abiding, hardworking, and educated: He took accounting classes, became a bookkeeper, and immersed himself in American culture, singing “Wheels on the Bus” in English to his kids and learning the language with the help of subtitles on Lost episodes. “He celebrated Thanksgiving with new friends, adopted the Chicago Bears, savored the buffet at Golden Corral,” writes Cox. “He imagined taking the naturalization oath and raising his family in the suburbs. He believed in Donald Trump.” Small yet vivid details like these make H’s journey impossible to ignore. Homeland Security claims that sending Afghans like H back to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan would pose no danger, but H believes that deportation means death for him and his family. For safety reasons, Cox withholds identifying details, but through interviews with H, his family, and their network of friends and colleagues, he builds a portrait of a man defined by hard work and faith—someone who still believes in the American dream, even as America turns him away. —CLR Carolyn Ariella Sofia | Aeon | October 20, 2025 | 4,013 words A chance meeting in a bookstore changed Carolyn Ariella Sofia’s life. The encounter was with Jerzy Kosiński, the Jewish Polish-American author of The Painted Bird, a harrowing novel about a boy wandering through Eastern European villages during the Second World War. Sofia describes the book with terrified awe: “a desperate note sent in a glass bottle that broke in my hands and made me bleed.” The two eventually go to dinner, where Sofia probes and unsettles Kosiński with her theory that one of his writing strategies is to “hide wartime details in female characters.” He resists exposure. Hiding had been deeply engraved into his psyche during childhood, when he survived the Holocaust by living with a Christian family, and Sofia cannot quite reach him. Their interactions remain taut and uneasy, almost menacing. He reveals little, even as he continues to draw her into a psychological game of cat and mouse. Beyond Kosiński, Sofia examines how the writers Georges Perec and Sarah Kofman divulge the fractured identities of their own war-torn childhoods, when they, too, suffocated their true selves to save their lives. This is no cozy read, but a piercing insight into how the inner turmoil of Holocaust survivors has painfully, gradually, turned into the raw material of their art. Sofia’s deft blend of psychology and literary analysis left me reeling at the complexity of survival, memory, and self-invention. —CW Jelani Cobb, Taylor Lorenz, Jack Shafer, and Max Tani | Harper’s Magazine | October 22, 2025 | 6,693 words There’s a video production company in Chicago called Mainstream Media, whose mission is to “help companies nationwide connect to their community with crisp and clear live video.” Mainstream Media is not a news organization, a point its founders have tried to make clear over the years, even adding a disclaimer to their website that reads, “We are not the actual ‘mainstream media.’” And yet, every so often—following bad-faith partisan attacks, for instance—the company receives messages from people angry at swaths of the American press. Misguided though they might be, these critics aren’t alone: Trust in the mass media is at its lowest point in half a century, according to one popular poll. And yet the mere existence of those annual polls reveals something about our perennial anxiety over the press. “Americans have never trusted large national institutions,” Jelani Cobb, dean of the Columbia Journalism School, remarks in this lively Harper’s forum with press critic Jack Shafer and reporters Max Tani and Taylor Lorenz. “In the nineteenth century, we didn’t trust the railroad monopolies; in the early twentieth century, we didn’t trust the newly corporatized banks. Today, when people think of a large, faceless, national institution, it’s more often than not the news media.” Is our loss in trust driven primarily by failures in coverage of Gaza or COVID-19, or about our collective distance from remote institutions that fail to reflect the communities they serve? The four journalists here differ in how they apportion responsibility, as well as how they interpret threats against press freedom in the US and what AI will do to entry-level journalism positions. They also complicate each other’s arguments productively, reminding each other, and us, that the mission of the media is, per Tani, to “meet people where they are.” You mean connect to our communities? Looks like Mainstream Media has the right idea. —BF Joanne McNeil | New York Review of Architecture | October 1, 2025 | 2,866 words I would be remiss if I didn’t start this blurb by tipping my hat to the editor who wrote this headline. I suspect many readers have already clicked on the link to the story purely because of this pun. Well done, whoever you are. Now to the meat of the thing: A self-driving Waymo taxi recently killed a bodega cat in San Francisco. In my book, that alone is reason enough to get the machines off the street. But I’m a grouch, so don’t listen to me—listen to Joanne McNeil. A resident of the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, McNeil considers Waymo and other robots now populating the city’s corridors in the context of the wider techno-capitalist push to force certain workers out of the US economy. McNeil follows a pink Coco food delivery robot to a ghost kitchen, where “twenty-six restaurants that exist only on DoorDash and Grubhub cook food for takeout customers” and “delivery bags and boxes are waiting . . . in lockers.” The endgame of facilities like this, McNeil posits, is to eliminate delivery drivers (and mom-and-pop restaurants, too). “It’s a setup primed for robots,” she writes, that “further warp[s] the coronavirus class divide: With machines (however remotely assisted) where essential workers used to be, those who WFH are ever more shielded from strangers beneath their tax bracket.” McNeil ties the robots in California’s streets to what’s happening in the state’s fields. She speaks to a Lyft driver originally from Salinas, who explains that agricultural companies in the Central Valley “haven’t been that vocal coming out against the ICE raids because they’re assuming that they’ll be able to automate farmwork.” In other words, they’ve decided it isn’t worth protecting the rights and dignity of people they won’t need to make money in the long term. In fewer words, they’re greedy and soulless. McNeil’s story is an essential tour of several overlapping landscapes—physical, technological, and political—shaped by the robber barons of the 21st century. —SD Anya Groner | Southlands | November 11, 2025 | 3,993 words It happens all the time: I’ll look up randomly while working, only to witness a black bear appear out of the bush and amble across our property. I can’t help but pause after these sightings. For me, it’s a moment of reverence for that wild being, and a reminder to be vigilant in the forest we share, to be sure they get the wide berth they deserve. Wendy Cowan tried to avoid conflict with a bear in the woods of Lunenburg County, Virginia, but unfortunately, things didn’t go as planned. In this piece for Southlands (a new publication!), Anya Groner recounts Cowan’s harrowing bear attack and reckons with the increasing encounters between bears and humans across the United States. This braided essay is a study in building tension; I sat motionless reading it, engrossed in Cowan’s encounter and an aftermath that was bloody in more ways than one. “For a moment, they were the same height, face to face and swaying like a dancing couple,” writes Groner. “Then the bear yawned, and Wendy knew she was in trouble.” Groner follows Cowan around Richmond’s East End, observing the survivor as she shares her story and photographic evidence with the curious. The scene work here brings depth to Cowan as a main character, shading in a painful and lengthy recovery period while highlighting the attack’s lasting—and surprisingly positive—emotional outcomes. Cowan’s made deep and profound connections with those who take a moment to listen to her story and to share their own trauma. She’s found a community of survivors, and for this, she’s grateful to the bear. This piece, while at times a terrifying read, is a stark and beautiful reminder of what happens when we refuse to be defined by the things we cannot control. —KS B. ‘Toastie’ Oaster | High Country News | November 7, 2025 | 6,282 words This piece deals with suicide. If you’re having thoughts of self-harm, please call or text 988 in the US, or chat online at 988lifeline.org, for a free, confidential conversation with a trained crisis counselor. Journalist B. ‘Toastie’ Oaster opens their High Country News piece with the words of young Indigenous metalheads on the Blackfeet Nation who have known people who have committed suicide: “Suicide has impacted my old friend group quite a bit.” “I’ve lost friends. I’ve lost family.” “My older brother.” “My sister’s youngest.” Their sobering remarks and the endless pain they hold stopped me in my tracks. Some are still teens. All have found belonging in heavy metal music, release in the fast and the loud. In vivid prose, Oaster reports on the finale of an alternative high school course that dives deep into heavy music and its history, politics, and values. As students discuss the art form, they identify subgenres of metal, deconstruct songs, and respond to what moves them. Some get inspired to start bands. Oaster also covers Fire in the Mountains, a “black metal Coachella” that took place on the Blackfeet Nation over three days in July 2025. Metal can seem violent and harsh to the uninitiated, but that easy assessment overlooks the community behind the music, a safe space where people can work through their troubles in a constructive way. “But something deeper draws metalheads together, perhaps a willingness to inquire on levels the establishment forbids,” writes Oaster. “What most clearly sets it apart from other genres is that it’s so rooted in anger and sadness—or their common ancestors: terror, lack, isolation and despair. Metal, one fan told me, is ‘a strange road to joy.’” Above all, this moving, life-affirming piece reminds us that when the going gets tough, the tough start headbanging. —KS Naomi Klein | Equator | November 26, 2025 | 7,346 words Why does this moment in time feel so uniquely awful? Naomi Klein’s expansive essay about art, philosophy, and political resistance addresses this nagging question, one that I’ve personally struggled to answer through a burst of fury every time I hear someone say, “This too shall pass.” Certainly, the concentration of horrors is part of it. We’re confronted with—and in some cases complicit in—fascism, genocide, and climatological destruction, to name just a few of the catastrophes at hand. And yes, recency bias is a factor. What’s happening now is raw, an open wound. But Klein articulates another crucial aspect. “[Time] doesn’t merely circle,” she writes, “it spirals, returning to places that feel familiar but are fundamentally different, having accumulated all the weight of what came before.” Walter Benjamin, whom Klein references throughout her piece, put it this way: “[History is] one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage.” In other words, today feels worse than the past because of the past. What should be the gifts of history have become painful burdens. Hard-won wisdom and knowledge are willfully ignored. Collective pledges to do and be better (“never again”) are perverted to justify new atrocities. How, then, to survive the ever-worsening of the world, the compounding of wreckage? “The interesting thing about spirals,” Klein notes, “is that if they switch directions, they don’t tighten—they broaden, opening like sunflowers, like seashells, like galaxies.” Reversing course means finding shared purpose not just in rejecting cruelty and destruction but in creating their antitheses. Among other people and movements, Klein directs readers to the Surrealists as an example of creative resistance: “We still have much to learn from their efforts—from their endless manifestos, their raucous debates, their sense of play, their solidarities, and their determination to pool their collective powers to meet the scale of their moment in history.” —SD Yasmin Tayag | The Atlantic | December 9, 2025 | 2,832 words I recently spoke at the funeral of an aunt—my Tita—who was the connective tissue of our extended family. Across the eulogies, a few themes repeated: the joy she sparked at gatherings, her generosity, and our shared love of food, especially the delicious, often fried dishes she helped prepare. Reading Yasmin Tayag’s Atlantic story about Jollibee felt fitting this week. Tayag traces the global rise of the Filipino fast-food chain, especially its expansion in the US, and shows how Filipino food—salty, sweet, sour, and rich with taste and feeling—is both deeply rooted in and constantly transformed by outside influences. This tension feels familiar to me. I remember when the first Jollibee in North America opened in 1998 in Daly City, California, where I was born. I grew up on comfort dishes—my aunt’s extra-crispy fried chicken, my uncle’s pork-rib sinigang, my mom’s adobo—but today my family looks very different from the one I grew up in. It’s expanded and blended: Chinese and British, Indian and Mexican, with new recipes added to the pot (my husband’s quinoa-based arroz caldo comes to mind). Like Filipino food itself, we’ve evolved. Jollibee now has more than 1,800 locations worldwide, with its parent company operating 10,000 stores across 19 Filipino and international brands. (I had no idea it owned The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf and Smashburger.) While Jollibee’s flavors are designed “for the mainstream,” and not everything on the menu is what I personally crave, I still admire its mission to export Filipino warmth and hospitality along with its food. Tayag writes about all of this with care, curiosity, and an obvious affection for what food can carry beyond taste. And if you’re unsure about Filipino spaghetti—unexpectedly sweet for some—try the version at Tipunan in the East Bay, and then thank me later. —CLR Kate Mossman | The New Statesman | December 11, 2025 | 6,764 words By the end of the first paragraph of this New Statesman piece, reporter Kate Mossman had my full attention. “The majority of those on Flight 2069 were asleep when Paul Mukonyi folded up his belongings at around 4am UK time, headed up the stairs into the toilet at the front of the plane, then came out and quietly let himself into the cockpit,” she writes. For the next two minutes and 38 seconds, terror and chaos ensued as Mukonyi fought the copilot to control the plane and crash it in an apparent suicide attempt, one which could have taken the lives of 400 other passengers with him. It took four men to subdue the attacker, but this is only the beginning of the story. (I’m reminded of “The Long Fall of One-Eleven Heavy,” Michael Paterniti’s Esquire feature about Swissair 111, which disintegrated upon impact with the sea off the coast of Nova Scotia in 1998, with 229 souls aboard.) Mossman’s central challenge is considerable: How do you tell the story of the disaster that did not happen? How do you maintain momentum in a piece where a safe outcome gets revealed early on? What her piece shares with Paterniti’s is strong pacing and character development. She introduces us to some of the crew and passengers, some of whom were only on the flight because of a missed connection. In vivid prose, Mossman tells this near-disaster through their eyes, ears, and memories. “This is the issue of the flight, as it lives on in the minds of those who survived it: how to measure the price of a disaster averted,” she writes. For me as a reader? I felt this story deep in my gut. —KS Explore all of our annual collections since 2011.

Title: The ugly truth at the heart of America's miserable job market

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. When Gbenga Ajilore thinks about America's job market, a few things keep him up at night: The slowing demand for entry-level talent, tariff chaos, and high interest rates. ChatGPT isn't one of them. "There is going to come a point where AI is just a part of everything that we do, but we're not there yet," Ajilore, who is chief economist at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policy and Priorities, said, adding, "The economy is paralyzed." The labor market is showing clear signs of weakness. Long-term unemployment has been trending upward, and the share of Americans looking for work recently eclipsed the number of available roles. Alongside a steady drum of layoff headlines, unemployment ticked up more than expected last month to 4.6%. Young people are having trouble breaking in, older workers are hesitant to retire, and with the "flattening" of many companies, the middle rungs of the career ladder are crumbling. Only healthcare and construction showed substantial growth. It's been called the white-collar recession, an unwelcome awakening for Americans who hoped their college degree would translate to long-term stability and a comfortable salary. Given the timing, it's easy to villainize artificial intelligence. C-Suite leaders across industries have said they're "all in on AI," often to the dismay of rank-and-file employees. The tech is quickly reshaping how workers are assessed on the job and how companies define productivity. It's even shaking up the hiring process: My colleagues have talked to job seekers who submitted hundreds of résumés without landing a role, as HR departments are swamped by AI-assisted applications. Economists and investors can't agree if chatbots are the future of the workforce or a vastly overblown bubble. But, in shouldering the blame for America's job market woes, AI has become a scapegoat for something else: The economy itself is deteriorating. Years of higher interest rates and stubborn inflation, along with slowing wage growth and restrictive trade policies, have created an environment where businesses are slashing budgets and the middle class is living paycheck to paycheck. If you're frustrated by a lower-than-expected raise or the inability to land a new gig, don't blame the robots. Blame Jerome Powell. There is no better example of the AI-is-wrecking-the-job-market fears than the so-called "Scariest Chart in the World." The chart has popped up in X and Bluesky posts, news reports, and a thick stack of Substack newsletters. The simple, two-line chart tracks two pieces of data: the S&P 500 and the number of US job vacancies since 2015. The two run closely together for the first couple of years, but there is a decided break in 2022 — the stock market continues to soar, and the number of available jobs begins to decline. AI doomers are quick to point out that the date those two lines diverged corresponds to the public launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The implication being that the explosion of large language models immediately began replacing thousands of jobs while pouring money into Wall Street. As chatbots and AI tools make employees more productive — drafting emails, writing code, and streamlining administrative tasks — and employers more profitable, the thinking goes, there will be less need for hiring human workers. There's plenty of anecdotal evidence from high-profile companies to support the idea. Nvidia wants employees to use AI "for every task possible," Microsoft is "rethinking" its business model for the AI age, Big Law is hoping AI can make its services faster and cheaper, and top banks and consulting firms are transferring some tasks from people to bots. But is AI already replacing a bunch of jobs? Probably not. Ajilore thinks the AI-sparked white collar downturn is "overblown." Many companies are "using AI as a cheat code as opposed to something that makes them more efficient," he said, "With the cheat code, you actually end up making mistakes and cutting corners." He believes that both chatbots and Corporate America's tech strategy have a long way to go before AI truly disrupts the workforce. Even Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, isn't sold on AI's effects on the current job market. When asked about the technology during the Fed's December meeting, Powell said AI "is part of the story, but it's not a big part of the story yet." There's also an important piece of context missing from "The Scariest Chart in the World": the federal funds rate. Decided eight times a year by Powell and his colleagues on the all-important (and dully-named) Federal Open Markets Committee, the Fed funds rate is the key interest rate that anchors all types of loans. For banks and businesses, the number determines how easily and cheaply they can borrow money. For consumers, Fed rates impact everything from home prices to auto loans and credit card rates. When interest rates are low, businesses can access debt more affordably, which helps them fuel growth and hiring. As the fed fund rate increases, however, the price of borrowing rises too. This can help keep inflation in check, but higher rates make it more expensive for companies to operate, meaning that many are seeking other areas to cut costs — often at the expense of employees. It's true that the S&P 500 and job openings began to diverge right as ChatGPT launched, but that's also when interest rates started to climb. Between early 2022 and late 2024, federal funds jumped by over 5 percentage points. This was a reshaping of monetary strategy meant to curb soaring prices and cool off a too-hot economy, and it was a major break with nearly a generation of previous policy. The Fed originally slashed interest rates to zero in 2008 to address the fallout from the financial crisis, and in the following 12 years, the benchmark interest rate never rose above 2.4%. Following the emergency measures of the early pandemic, the dramatic hikes of 2022 were a sign that the zero-interest-rate era of the 2010s had officially come to an end. This sudden interest rate rise was a turning point many businesses. Hiring boomed in the early pandemic: Job openings skyrocketed to record highs as tech and business fields scrambled to snap up new talent. The Beige Book — a collection of quotes and insights gathered from business owners across the country by the various regional Federal Reserve banks — provides a valuable window into the thinking of hiring managers and executives during this period. Labor market commentary across 2021 and 2022 Beige Books tend to reference "modest to strong" job growth, robust hiring demand, and a shortage of workers, with very few mentions of interest rates. This changed when the Fed started hiking rates. One note in the November 2022 edition of the Beige Book said that "Interest rates and inflation continued to weigh on activity," another said "labor demand weakened overall," pointing to layoffs in tech, finance, and real estate. Both blue-collar and white-collar sectors felt the brunt of interest rates that year, citing steep borrowing costs as a central reason they're not hiring. Americans, meanwhile, stopped quitting their jobs as vacancies dried up, and the job market saw its biggest layoff spike since the 2020 shutdown. Corporate America began to lean into "efficiency" rhetoric alongside rising rates. Reduced bureaucracy and red tape, along with a smaller workforce, were sold by the C-Suite as a profit panacea in the face of higher financing costs. Leaders at Meta, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and others spoke about hiring freezes and job cuts as a productivity bet versus a financial issue. The trend continued: An October 2023 Beige Book note said many sectors "reduced hiring plans" and were "rightsizing" their budgets because of rising rates. Fast forward to today, and businesses are still grappling with the increased cost of funding, even as Powell and the Fed have moved slowly to lower their benchmark rate. In October's Beige Book, businesses big and small mentioned layoffs and attrition more so than new hiring. Beige Book reports over the past year suggest that AI is contributing to hiring softening in certain areas, such as call centers and accounting firms, but not widespread job displacement. Instead, "uncertainty" and "tariffs" were two of the most frequently mentioned words by companies such as Tesla, JPMorgan, and Whirlpool during earnings calls. But saying the need for layoffs is the result of a long-term change in the cost of financing isn't very sexy. Better to point to AI as both an excuse for layoffs and a way to give investors hope for the future. Chen Zhao, head of economics research at the real estate firm Redfin, said many companies are struggling to balance profits with the steep cost of borrowing money. This is especially true in the housing sector, she said, because it's sensitive to the federal funds rate. She said fields like tech are similarly vulnerable. "I think that what's happening is just simple economics," she said, adding, "But when you say that you're going to do layoffs or you're not going to be hiring as much, it doesn't sound very good to investors. It sounds a lot better if you say that you're seeing all these productivity enhancements because of AI." Each recent technological development — computers, cellphones, the internet — has reshaped the job market and the workplace, but people tend to underestimate the timeline. Economists said it will take years, possibly decades, before we have concrete evidence that AI is replacing jobs on a large scale. And AI may create thousands of jobs as it makes others obsolete. "I think the overall evolution of the technology is going to be a lot slower than both the optimists and doomers think," said Scott Lincicome, vice president of economics and trade at the right-leaning Cato Institute. AI has developed rapidly, and while it can perform basic tasks, it is still a long way from replacing human judgment, creativity, and decision-making. "There will certainly be disruptions, that's inevitable," he said. "But it won't be cataclysmic." The job market is in a rut — but chatbots aren't the sole, or even the main, culprit. Despite the weakening job market numbers, the Federal Reserve has cut rates three times this year, a cautious policy stance brought on by economic precarity. Recent Fed reports show that trade policy and inflation are keeping Powell and company from cutting rates at a faster pace, even as the employment outlook weakens. It has also sparked division within the central bank itself: The December meeting saw the highest number of Fed members disagreeing with the interest rate committee's final decision since 2019. Economic projections also show the median committee member expects one rate cut in 2026, less than projected at this time last year. The moves signal an economic situation that isn't catastrophic, so long as Powell plays his cards carefully. A pattern of cuts could start bringing relief for borrowers, but it will take time for the economy to recover — and there are still steep headwinds. Fast-changing tariffs are exacerbating the impact of high rates, making many businesses hesitant to invest or spend money. As Lincicome put it, "Tariff uncertainty is really a drag on the job market because companies are saddled with millions, if not billions, of dollars in additional taxes and tariff costs." Declining immigration due to Trump's deportation policies is also part of the equation: Fewer immigrants in the workforce is contributing to a slowing labor force participation rate. Ajilore also said that the sweeping cost-cutting strategy of DOGE for the federal workforce added fuel to the corporate world's "efficiency" crusade. It all adds up to some extremely valid job anxiety for workers. Economists expect the market to grow and adapt alongside new technology — and the AI takeover forecast is far less grim than most people realize. The chatbot revolution may come someday. But, for better or worse, the real headliner is the federal funds rate. Allie Kelly is a reporter on Business Insider's Economy team.

Title: Microsoft, Apple, Meta and Amazon’s stocks are lagging the S&P 500 this year—but Google is up 62% and AI investors think it has room to run
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/microsoft-apple-meta-and-amazons-stocks-are-lagging-the-sp-500-this-year-but-google-is-up-62-and-ai-investors-think-it-has-room-to-run/

Investing in Big Tech companies used to be simple and straightforward. You could simply scoop up a basket of the five internet giants—Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Google’s parent firm, Alphabet—and count on them to outperform the market. Their share prices didn’t move strictly in tandem, but you could expect a close sector-wide correlation. Now, in the AI era, all that’s gone out the window. Looking at the share performance of the Big Five this year, it’s hard to believe these companies are in the same category. Three of the group are lagging slightly behind the overall S&P 500 index, which is on track for a roughly 16% gain this year. The group—Microsoft, Apple, and Meta—is instead pacing at around 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively. A fourth, onetime market darling Amazon, is floundering far behind with a miserable 1% gain. Then there is Google, whose current gains of around 62% make it one of the best performing stocks of 2025. This wild divergence among the biggest of the Big Tech players is directly tied to how well they are faring in artificial intelligence. In the past two years, AI has become an overriding fixation for investors, and led all five companies to spend eye-popping sums on talent and infrastructure. Google, though, appears to be the only one that has parlayed its investment into a winning business strategy. This raises the question of how exactly the search giant pulled this off, and whether any of the four laggards can do the same—and deliver a similar win for their suffering shareholders. Google’s AI-fueled stock gains are impressive, especially in light of its early misfires with the technology. The most notable of these came in February of 2024 when, in an attempt to pull even with the capabilities of OpenAI’s wildly popular ChatGPT, Google rebooted its first mediocre AI chatbot, Bard, and launched a rebranded, multimodal AI under the new Gemini name. The new product’s error-filled results and blatant political biases—including the depiction of Nazis as people of color—led investors to punish Google stock, and worry that the company’s leadership had already lost the AI race. That narrative soon changed, however, when Google took Gemini back to the shop for a deep overhaul, and released vastly improved versions in the second half of last year. Meanwhile, the company has integrated AI features almost seamlessly into its core search product, while creating buzz around new products like image-generating service Nano Banana, which debuted this summer. These launches have helped boost its share price, but are just one part of a broader AI success story. The reason Google is pulling away is because the company is tapping into various AI strengths, and building a broader flywheel that is generating a constant series of improvements. For starters, the search giant has a powerful research lab in the form of Google DeepMind that has helped it build a model to compete with the likes of OpenAI. It also has its own in-house cloud service, Google Cloud, which provides the infrastructure to satisfy the insatiable energy and compute demands of running a scaled AI service. Critically, its infrastructure stack also includes its in-house AI chips, called Tensor Processing Units, meaning Google doesn’t have to compete in the global scramble for Nvidia chips. Meanwhile, TPUs are far from a second-rate technology. The latest version of the chip, known as Ironwood, is the TPU’s seventh iteration, and is being sought out by other leading AI players. All of this means Google is singularly positioned among its Big Tech rivals to excel in AI technology and know-how. At the same time, its recent performance has allayed fears that broadening its AI offerings meant cannibalizing revenue from its core search business. Instead, Google is showing that AI can be accretive, even allowing the company to charge advertisers more on the ground that clicks tied to tools like AI Overview reflect a high search intent. Even better for the company, it has numerous products where it can test and fine-tune its AI offerings, including YouTube, Maps, and its core search product. And while not known as an enterprise company, products like Google Docs, Sheets, and Gmail mean it has millions of opportunities to test out AI in the workplace. Finally, Google has a strong foothold in the devices sector—where many think the future fight for AI dominance will play out—thanks to Pixel phones and long involvement in the Android operating system. All of Google’s Big Tech rivals, meanwhile, lack some or most of the components making up its AI flywheel. But the story of Silicon Valley is one of constant disruption, meaning any of the other firms still has a shot to build or buy their way back into the lead. The value of Big Tech firms is, like any company, determined by multiple factors. Still, the relatively poor performance of shares in Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta appears to be entirely a function of their failing to show big returns on their massive AI investments. Amazon, the worst of the laggards by far, does have one obvious attribute that makes it a contender: its industry-leading AWS cloud, which means the firm is well positioned to run AI operations at scale. Unfortunately, the Seattle firm is falling far short on other fronts. In the case of chips, Amazon has been producing its own, known as Trainium, for some time in order to reduce reliance on Nvidia. The chips, however, appear far from best in class—an assessment reflected in the decision of Amazon’s close partner, Anthropic, to deploy Google’s chips as well. On the LLM front, Amazon has its own models, but has also invested $8 billion in Anthropic, reflecting its ongoing need to build strategic capacity to keep up with other big AI players. Meanwhile, Amazon has few options when it comes to deploying the AI expertise it acquires. Shopping, which is the company’s bread and butter, is just one narrow application in a far broader field, while Amazon’s Alexa and Echo devices have nowhere near the reach of numerous Google products. At the same time, Amazon has not made the most of the device opportunities it does have; reviews of its new AI-branded AIexa+ have been lukewarm. Then there is Meta, which is the second worst stock performer of the Big Five this year, despite flashing early promise in AI. That potential has been most prominent in the company’s family of open-source Llama models, which Meta is deploying across its various properties, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram. The most recent versions of Llama, however, have failed to keep up with rivals’ newer models, even as the company is spending eye-watering amounts of money to poach prominent AI researchers. Less encouraging for Meta’s AI efforts are its lack of a cloud and limited in-house chip capacity, which has led it to turn to Google as a supplier. And while its huge social media footprint is a natural distribution platform, tech observers note that Meta has already deployed AI extensively to boost ad performance—and that it may have already reaped most of the significant gains on this front. Worse, according to the New York Times, the splashy new hires have created internal company friction between the researchers who want to push the bounds of AI science, and company executives who want to see concrete financial gains. As for Microsoft, the Big Tech firm that has come closest among the laggards in keeping pace with the S&P 500, it has the same cloud advantage as Amazon and Google. It is also a relatively early mover in the AI field, thanks to its large investment in OpenAI and early ties to the startup. Lately, though, the tie-up between Microsoft and OpenAI’s Sam Altman has been strained, which could complicate the software giant’s future path. Unlike its archrival Google, Microsoft is not known for its chip prowess and has largely relied on Nvidia GPUs over its in-house chips. And while the company has a huge distribution footprint—think Office, Bing, LinkedIn, and more—it has failed to rack up early wins. That includes in the enterprise sector, which Microsoft traditionally dominates, but where its Copilot AI tool has failed to impress. Finally, there is Apple, whose AI record has been sparse and disappointing. This is perhaps surprising given the iPhone maker’s extensive hardware expertise, and long experience with cloud services. Apple, however, faces distinct challenges from other Big Tech firms. Those include making privacy a core part of its brand appeal. This may appeal to consumers, but it’s also not conducive to the sort of massive data-gobbling that goes with building large AI models. The growing perception that Google is pulling away with the AI game is reflected both in vibes and in the company’s share price. At the same time, there is another key metric that suggests the stock price could go higher still. Namely, the P/E ratio—a metric that has long been useful in determining whether a company is overvalued—is currently around 30 for Google. That is around the same level as Meta and Amazon, and significantly lower than that of Microsoft and Apple, which means the market may not have yet baked in the possibility of Google translating its AI performance into revenue growth. Even as Google is enjoying front-of-the-pack status among its longtime internet peers, there are two developments that could significantly shake up the AI race in Big Tech. The first is one of its rivals carrying out a major acquisition to boost their standing in AI, and more effectively take on Google. This may be easier said than done, however, since there are relatively few big AI startups left on the board. The most tempting target may be Anthropic, but its valuation has grown so large that it may be too big even for a Big Tech firm to swallow. The other factor that could shake up the AI race is shifting consumer behavior. There is wide speculation that people will come to embrace new ways to interact with AI, including through new types of wearable or embedded devices. Startups like Friend are selling AI pendants, and Meta is making a major bet on Ray-Ban–style glasses with built-in AI screens. Sales of these wearable AI devices, however, have been modest at best, and it’s not clear they will ever fully catch on. Instead, it’s not hard to imagine consumers choosing to stick with their phones and watches for the foreseeable AI future, until a new paradigm emerges—perhaps one involving internal chips and biometrics. The upshot is that the contours of the AI economy are still emerging, and that new technologies and companies will arrive to serve it en masse. Until then, however, the companies at the core of Big Tech will continue to have a big AI presence—especially Google.

Title: CoreWeave Has Lost a Staggering Amount of Stock Value Over the Past Six Months
URL: http://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/coreweave-lost-value-six-months
Time Published: 2025-12-16T22:10:05Z

By Victor Tangermann Published Dec 16, 2025 5:10 PM EST AI cloud computing company CoreWave exploded onto the scene in March with the biggest tech IPO since 2021. The company’s stock soared by more than 40 percent in the following days, riding on the coattails of immense hype surrounding generative AI. The hype was driven by insatiable AI companies like Microsoft, OpenAI, and Meta leasing hundreds of megawatts of compute as outfits like CoreWeave construct enormous data centers. If AI chipmaker Nvidia is the one selling shovels during the ongoing AI gold rush, in other words, CoreWeave is the one buying those shovels in bulk and leasing access to the digging sites. But persistent fears of an AI bubble have put a massive damper on investor enthusiasm, leaving many to wonder whether CoreWeave could be the canary in the coalmine — and even drawing comparisons to Enron, a company with an extremely speculative valuation that imploded following a major accounting scandal in 2001. As the Wall Street Journal reports, CoreWeave’s share price has plunged 46 percent in just six weeks, with $33 billion of value going up in smoke. At press time, shares are hovering at just under $70, meaning the company has lost a staggering 56 percent of its stock value in just six months. It may well be a sign that investors are jittery that the enormous spending by the likes of CoreWeave may not be justified in the long run. Even AI leaders have warned that a return may still be many years out, with OpenAI admitting last month that it won’t make any money until at least 2030. It doesn’t take much reading between the lines to understand why they’re nervous. Taking on an enormous amount of high-interest debt to construct and lease AI data centers leaves the firm with a considerable degree of risk, potentially putting it first on the chopping block in case the AI bubble were to implode. Its operations are also meeting some major headwinds, both literally and figuratively. Rainstorms in Texas forced the company to delay the pouring of a foundation for an AI data center complex, pushing back the completion date by months, the WSJ reports. Investors have also balked at circular financing arrangements in the sector. For instance, Nvidia owns six percent of the company’s shares, while CoreWeave has signed an exclusivity contract with the AI chipmaker to only use its GPUs. Microsoft represented 62 percent of CoreWeave’s 2024 revenue, as the Wall Street Journal pointed out last month, and is also a major shareholder of CoreWeave’s top customer, OpenAI. Then there’s CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator, who downplayed those fears last month. “If you’re building something that accelerates the economy and has fundamental value to the world, the world will find ways to finance an enormous amount of business,” he said at a Wall Street Journal event in early November. Days after downplaying concerns over an AI bubble, Intrator was probed by investors during a quarterly earnings call about the delays at the Texas data center construction site. He argued that “there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” and that “this one data center will catch up, and then we will move forward from there.” As per the WSJ, the company’s CFO, Nitin Agrawal, was forced to intervene and clarify that there were delays plaguing several data centers for a single “data center provider.” Investors are also concerned that the enormous amount of debt being taken on could compound significantly due to supply chain bottlenecks. Delays may not sound like a big deal in the grand scheme of things, but considering how much money and interest are on the line, an enormous amount of pressure is on CoreWeave to deliver some good news. “The bull case is that they’ll scale into it, and that a lot of companies have low margins to start, but this is a company at scale,” DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria told the WSJ. “There is no scaling going on here.” More on the AI bubble: AI Investors Furious at Suggestion That There’s an AI Bubble I’m a senior editor at Futurism, where I edit and write about NASA and the private space sector, as well as topics ranging from SETI and artificial intelligence to tech and medical policy.

Title: Google researchers unlock some truths about getting AI agents to actually work

Welcome to Eye on AI. In this edition…President Trump takes aim at state AI regulations with a new executive order…OpenAI unveils a new image generator to catch up with Google’s Nano Banana….Google DeepMind trains a more capable agent for virtual worlds…and an AI safety report card doesn’t provide much reassurance. Hello. 2025 was supposed to be the year of AI agents. But as the year draws to a close, it is clear such prognostications from tech vendors were overly optimistic. Yes, some companies have started to use AI agents. But most are not yet doing so, especially not in company-wide deployments.A McKinsey “State of AI” survey from last month found that a majority of businesses had yet to begin using AI agents, while 40% said they were experimenting. Less than a quarter said they had deployed AI agents at scale in at least one use case; and when the consulting firm asked people about whether they were using AI in specific functions, such as marketing and sales or human resources, the results were even worse. No more than 10% of survey respondents said they had AI agents “fully scaled” or were “in the process of scaling” in any of these areas. The one function with the most usage of scaled agents was IT (where agents are often used to automatically resolve service tickets or install software for employees), and even here only 2% reported having agents “fully scaled,” with an additional 8% saying they were “scaling.” A big part of the problem is that designing workflows for AI agents that will enable them to produce reliable results turns out to be difficult. Even the most capable of today’s AI models sit on a strange boundary—capable of doing certain tasks in a workflow as well as humans, but unable to do others. Complex tasks that involve gathering data from multiple sources and using software tools over many steps represent a particular challenge. The longer the workflow, the more risk that an error in one of the early steps in a process will compound, resulting in a failed outcome. Plus, the most capable AI models can be expensive to use at scale, especially if the workflow involves the agent having to do a lot of planning and reasoning.Many firms have sought to solve these problems by designing “multi-agent workflows,” where different agents are spun up, with each assigned just one discrete step in the workflow, including sometimes using one agent to check the work of another agent. This can improve performance, but it too can wind up being expensive—sometimes too expensive to make the workflow worth automating. Now a team at Google has conducted research that aims to give businesses a good rubric for deciding when it is better to use a single agent, as opposed to building a multi-agent workflow, and what type of multi-agent workflows might be best for a particular task. The researchers conducted 180 controlled experiments using AI models from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. They tried them against four different agentic AI benchmarks that covered a diverse set of goals: retrieving information from multiple websites; planning in a Minecraft game environment; planning and tool use to accomplish common business tasks such as answering emails, scheduling meetings, and using project management software; and a finance agent benchmark. That finance test requires agents to retrieve information from SEC filings and perform basic analytics, such as comparing actual results to management’s forecasts from the prior quarter, figuring out how revenue derived from a specific product segment has changed over time, or figuring out how much cash a company might have free for M&A activity. In the past year, the conventional wisdom has been that multi-agent workflows produce more reliable results. (I’ve previously written about this view, which has been backed up by the experience of some companies, such as Prosus, here in Eye on AI.) But the Google researchers found instead that whether the conventional wisdom held was highly contingent on exactly what the task was. If the task was sequential, which was the case for many of the Minecraft benchmark tasks, then it turned out that so long as a single AI agent could perform the task accurately at least 45% of the time (which is a pretty low bar, in my opinion), then it was better to deploy just one agent. Using multiple agents, in any configuration, reduced overall performance by huge amounts, ranging between 39% and 70%. The reason, according to the researchers, is that if a company had a limited token budget for completing the entire task, then the demands of multiple agents trying to figure out how to use different tools would quickly overwhelm the budget. But if a task involved steps that could be performed in parallel, as was true for many of the financial analysis tasks, then multi-agent systems conveyed big advantages. What’s more, the researchers found that exactly how the agents are configured to work with one another makes a big difference, too. For the financial-analysis tasks, a centralized multi-agent system—where a single coordinator agent directs and oversees the activity of multiple sub-agents and all communication flows to and from the coordinator—produced the best result. This system performed 80% better than a single agent. Meanwhile, an independent multi-agent system, in which there is no coordinator and each agent is simply assigned a narrow role that they complete in parallel, was only 57% better than a single agent. Research like this should help companies figure out the best ways to configure AI agents and enable the technology to finally begin to deliver on last year’s promises. For those selling AI agent technology, late is better than never. For the people working in the businesses using AI agents, we’ll have to see what impact these agents have on the labor market. That’s a story we’ll be watching closely as we head into 2026. With that, here’s more AI news.

President Trump signed an executive order giving the U.S. Attorney General broad power to challenge and potentially overturn state laws that regulate artificial intelligence, arguing they hinder U.S. “global AI dominance.” The order also allows federal agencies to withhold funding from states that keep such laws. Trump said he wanted to replace what he called a confusing patchwork of state rules with a single federal framework—but the order did not contain any new federal requirements for those building AI models. Tech companies welcomed the move, but the executive order drew bipartisan criticism and is expected to face legal challenges from states and consumer groups who argue that only Congress can pre-empt state laws.

Oracle denied a Bloomberg report that it had delayed completion of data centers being built for OpenAI, saying all projects remain on track to meet contractual commitments despite labor and materials shortages. The report rattled investors already worried about Oracle’s debt-heavy push into AI infrastructure under its $300 billion OpenAI deal, and investors pummeled Oracle's stock price. You can read more on Oracle’s denial from Reuters here. Oracle was also shaken by reports that it has $248 billion in rental payments for data centers that will commence between now and 2028. That was covered by Bloomberg here.OpenAI launches new image generation model. The company debuted a new image generation AI model that it says offers more fine-grained editing control and generates images four times faster than its previous image creators. The move is being widely viewed as an effort by OpenAI to show that it has not lost ground to competitors, in particular Google, whose Nano Banana Pro image generation model has been the talk of the internet since it launched in late November. You can read more from Fortune’s Sharon Goldman here.OpenAI hires Shopify executive in push to make ChatGPT an ‘operating system’ The AI company hired Glen Coates, who had been head of “core product” at Shopify, to be its new head of app platform, working under ChatGPT product head Nick Turley. “We’re going to find out what happens if you architect an OS ground-up with a genius at its core that use its apps just like you can,” Coates wrote in a LinkedIn post announcing the move. A Google DeepMind agent that can make complex plans in a virtual world. The AI lab debuted an updated version of its SIMA agent, called SIMA 2, that can navigate complex, 3D digital worlds, including those from different video games. Unlike earlier systems that only followed simple commands, SIMA 2 can understand broader goals, hold short conversations, and figure out multi-step plans on its own. In tests, it performed far better than its predecessor and came close to human players on many tasks, even in games it had never seen before. Notably, SIMA 2 can also teach itself new skills by setting its own challenges and learning from trial and error. The paper shows progress towards AI that can act, adapt, and learn in environments rather than just analyze text or images. The approach, which is based on reinforcement learning—a technique where an agent learns by trial and error to accomplish a goal—should help power more capable virtual assistants and, eventually, real-world robots.

Is it safe? A few weeks ago, the Future of Life Institute (FLI) released its latest AI Safety Index, a report that grades leading AI labs on how they are doing on a range of safety criteria. A clear gap has emerged between three of the leading AI labs and pretty much everyone else. OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic all received grades in the “C” range. Anthropic and OpenAI both scored a C+, with Anthropic narrowly beating OpenAI on its total safety score. Google DeepMind’s solid C was an improvement from the C- it scored when FLI last graded the field on their safety efforts back in July. But the rest of the pack is doing a pretty poor job. X.ai and Meta and DeepSeek all received Ds, while Alibaba, which makes the popular open source AI model Qwen, got a D-. (DeepSeek’s grade was actually a step up from the F it received in the summer.)Despite this somewhat dismal picture, FLI CEO Max Tegmark—ever an optimist—told me he actually sees some good news in the results. Not only did all the labs pull up their raw scores by at least some degree, more AI companies agreed to submit data to FLI in order to be graded. Tegmark sees this as evidence that the AI Safety Index is starting to have its intended effect of creating “a race to the top” on AI safety. But Tegmark also allows that all three of the top-marked AI labs saw their scores for “current harms” from AI—such as the negative impacts their models can have on mental health—slip since they were assessed in the summer. And when it comes to potential “existential risks” to humanity, none of the labs gets a grade above D. Somehow that doesn’t cheer me. Businesses took big steps forward on the AI journey in 2025, from hiring Chief AI Officers to experimenting with AI agents.

Investing Roku was just upgraded to an overweight rating with a $135 price target by analysts at Morgan Stanley. Sending You to Google News in 3 © insta_photos / Shutterstock.com Personal computers, the Internet, social networking, cell phones, and artificial intelligence have all significantly altered life as we know it. Nowadays, we’re told quantum computing will be the next big thing. All with the ability to solve problems far too complex for typical computers within minutes, or even seconds. In fact, “Overall, the global quantum computing market is expected to grow from $1.6 billion in 2025 to $7.3 billion by 2030, according to BCC Research. That represents a compound annual growth rate of 34.6% over the next five years,” added U.S. News & World Report. Given the surge of interest and potential in quantum computing, it would also help explain why analysts at Jefferies say D-Wave Quantum (NASDAQ: QBTS) could surge 90% higher in 2026. The firm now has a buy rating and a $45 price target. It also cited roadmap execution, commercial traction, and technical proof points as catalysts. In addition, the firm says QBTS has a strong balance sheet with solid liquidity. Analysts at Mizuho gave QBTS an outperform rating, arguing that it accounts for about 20% of the total quantum computing market. The firm has a price target of $46 on the QBTS stock. Last trading at $23.74, we’d like to see QBTS rally back to $37.50 initially. Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) was just upgraded to an overweight rating with a $135 price target by analysts at Morgan Stanley. The firm says ROKU can sustain its double-digit platform revenue growth with stronger platform partnerships, higher streaming prices, premium subscription adoption, and healthier advertising. It added that “sustained platform revenue growth should remain the key driver for valuation going forward, given Roku is still in early stage GAAP profitability,” as noted by CNBC. Analysts at Jefferies upgraded ROKU to a buy rating. It also noted that ROKU is “one of the cleanest revision stories in Internet heading into 2026,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. The firm also expects 20% upside potential from demand-side platform ramps, politics, and subscriber momentum. Technically, if ROKU can break above double top resistance at around $116.66, it could potentially retest $150 a share. Analysts at Citi just reiterated a buy rating on EssilorLuxotica (OTC: ESLOY), noting that AI glasses are “the next fast-growing edge device,” as quoted by CNBC. At the moment, the company is developing smart glasses with Meta that can “play music, take photos, and translate, and they are emerging as a key growth driver for the luxury eyewear giant, as awareness among richer and tech-savvy customers grows fast. The newest version includes a built-in display that allows users to read messages, view photo previews, and read live captions while having a conversation with someone, using a neural wristband to interact with the device through hand gestures.” Analysts at Citi also expect the AI glasses market to grow by more than 100% a year through 2030. Citi also expects the market to surpass 110 million units by 2030. Other companies that could release AI smart glasses include Alphabet, Snap, Samsung, Tencent, and Apple.

Title: Broadcom Can’t Stop Falling. Overreaction or AI Stock Warning Sign?
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/16/broadcom-cant-stop-falling-overreaction-or-ai-stock-warning-sign/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chris Hondros / Hulton Archive via Getty Images Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has delivered a strong performance in 2025, with shares up approximately 46% year-to-date, driven largely by demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductors and custom chips. The stock reached an all-time high of $414.61 per share last week. However, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, its shares have declined sharply. The day after it hit its peak — which beat expectations on revenue and earnings per share — the stock fell more than 11% in a single session over concerns about gross margin pressure from a higher mix of AI revenue. Additional declines followed, with shares dropping another 5.6% yesterday, resulting in a cumulative drop of more than 17% over three trading days. Broadcom’s stock is trending lower again this morning in premarket trading. Broader concerns about AI investment returns and profitability have pressured multiple AI-related stocks in recent weeks, though Broadcom had held up better until this pullback. Shares are roughly flat over the prior month. The question for investors is, does this sharp drop indicate more downside ahead, or is it a back-up-the-truck opportunity in a company with robust long-term AI prospects? Broadcom’s ascent in 2025 stemmed primarily from explosive growth in its AI semiconductor business. Fiscal fourth-quarter AI revenue hit $6.5 billion, up 74% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for custom AI processors and networking solutions from hyperscalers such as Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Anthropic, and OpenAI. The chipmaker secured major contracts, including partnerships for custom chips, that contributed to overall revenue growth of 28% in the quarter. Its infrastructure software segment — bolstered by the 2023 VMware acquisition — provided additional ssupport with recurring subscription revenue. These factors propelled the stock’s gains this year, outpacing many peers and solidifying Broadcom’s position as a key beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. Yet, the sharp decline began after the earnings release. Despite beating estimates and guiding for strong first-quarter revenue, management highlighted gross margin pressure from an increase in AI revenue, which carries lower margins than some traditional segments. This sparked investor worries about near-term profitability in the AI boom. The sell-off intensified during a broader rotation out of AI-related stocks, spurred by reports of delayed data center projects and debates over returns on hyperscaler capital expenditures. Rising debt levels have also weighed on the sector. Semiconductor indexes fell significantly — the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, comprising the 30 largest U.S.-traded semiconductor stocks, is down more than 6% — with Broadcom leading decliners on multiple days. Profit-taking after the year’s massive run also played a role, as expectations had run high heading into earnings, a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation. Analysts, though, remain overwhelmingly positive on Broadcom’s outlook. Consensus ratings remain a Strong Buy, with an average one-year price target of $455 per share, implying 33% upside. UBS raised its target to $475 per share after the earnings report, while Trusit Financial set an industry high of $500 per share. Analysts seemed unanimous in their outlook, all reiterating buy or better ratings, citing sustained AI demand, a large backlog, and potential for accelerated growth next year. They point to Broadcom’s leadership in custom AI chips and networking as supporting further sales growth. Broadcom trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 25x based on fiscal 2026 estimates, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.69 when factoring in its expected 36% long-term EPS growth. Analysts project that strong earnings expansion will be driven by AI, making Broadcom’s current valuation appear reasonable based on its growth prospects compared to its historical multiples. The chipmaker’s recent drop reflects short-term concerns over margins and AI spending worries rather than any fundamental weakness in demand. With analysts maintaining Buy ratings and lofty price targets, plus ongoing AI revenue acceleration, dips like this present buying opportunities for long-term investors focused on Broadcom’s dominant position in AI infrastructure.

Title: Satyajit Das: AI – Artificial Intelligence or Absolute Insanity?

Time Published: 2025-12-16T09:32:29Z

Yves here. Satyajit Das provides a high level but nevertheless very effective indictment of the scam known as AI. I hope readers will circulate this post widely. By Satyajit Das, a former banker and author of numerous technical works on derivatives and several general titles: Traders, Guns & Money: Knowns and Unknowns in the Dazzling World of Derivatives (2006 and 2010), Extreme Money: The Masters of the Universe and the Cult of Risk (2011) and A Banquet of Consequence – Reloaded (2016 and 2021). His latest book is on ecotourism – Wild Quests: Journeys into Ecotourism and the Future for Animals (2024). This is an expanded version of a piece first published on 4 November 2025 in the New Indian Express print edition. AI is tracing the familiar, weary boom and bust trajectory identified in 1837 by Lord Overstone of quiescence, improvement, confidence, prosperity, excitement, overtrading, convulsion, pressure, stagnation, and distress. There are three primary concerns. First, there are doubts about the technology. Building on earlier technologies such as neural networks, rule-based expert systems, big data, pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms, GenAI (generative AI), the newest iteration, uses LLMs (large learning models) trained on massive data sets to create text and imagery. The holy grail is the ‘singularity’, a hypothetical point where machines surpass human intelligence. It would, in Silicon Valley speak, lead to ‘the merge’, when humans and machines come together potentially transforming creativity and technology. LLMs require enormous quantities of data. Existing firms in online search, sales platforms and social media platforms can exploit their own data troves. This is frequently supplemented by aggressive and unauthorised scraping of online data, sometimes confidential, leading to litigation around access, compensation and privacy. In practice, most AI models must rely on incomplete data which is difficult to clean to ensure accuracy. Despite massive scaling up of computing power, GenAI consistently fails in relatively simple factual tasks due to errors, biases and misinformation in datasets used. AI models are adept at interpolating answers between things within the data set but poor at extrapolation. Like any rote-learner, they struggle with novel problems. Their ability to act autonomously interacting within dynamic environments remains questionable. Cognitive scientists argue that simply scaling up LLMs based on sophisticated pattern-matching built to autocomplete rather than proper and robust world models will disappoint. Claimed progress is difficult to measure as benchmarks are vague and inconclusive. Cheerleaders miss that LLMs do not reason but are probabilistic prediction engines. A system which trawls existing data, even assuming that is correct, cannot create anything new. Once existing data sources are devoured, scaling produces diminishing returns. Rather than fully generalisable intelligence, generative models are regurgitation engines struggling with truth, hallucinations and reasoning. AI models can take over certain labour-intensive tasks like data driven research, journalism and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics, testing and routine administrative tasks like handling standard customer service queries. Its loftier aims may prove elusive. Predictions of medical breakthroughs have disappointed although pre- OpenAI machine learning models, pattern recognition engines and classifiers, used for years, continue to be useful. For the moment, GenAI, an ill-defined marketing rather than technical term, remains a costly parlour trick for some low-level applications, making memes and allowing scammers to deceive and defraud – the “unfathomable in pursuit of the indefinable”. Second, financial returns may prove elusive. Capital expenditure on AI is expected to total up to $5-7 trillion by 2030. AI startup valuations based on the latest round of funding were $2.30 trillion, up from $1.69 trillion in 2024, and up from $469 billion in 2020. But AI’s capacity to generate cash and returns on the investment remains questionable. Revenues would have to grow over 20 times from the current $15-20 billion per annum to just cover current annual investment in land, building, rapidly depreciating chips and power and water operating expenses. Revenues totalling more than $1 trillion may be required to earn an adequate return. Microsoft’s Windows and Office, among the world’s most used software, generates less than $100 billion in commercial and consumer revenue. Around 5 percent of its 800 million users currently pay to use ChatGPT. Microsoft’s CEO drew the ire of true believers when he argued that AI had yet to produce a profitable killer application to match the impact of email or Excel. The hope is AI will be paid for from higher productivity and corporate profits. But 95 percent of corporate GenAI pilot projects failed to raise revenue growth. After cutting hundreds of jobs and replacing them with AI, many firm were subsequently forced to reemploy staff when the technology proved deficient. Corporate interest is already showing sign of plateauing. Monetisation of AI faces other uncertainties. Several Chinese firms, such as DeepSeek, Moonshot as well as Bytedance and Alibaba, have developed cheaper models which cast doubts about the capital investment intensive approach of Western firms. China’s favoured open-source design would also undermine the revenues of firms which have invested heavily in proprietary technology. Required electricity and water supplies may prove to be constraints. In the meantime, AI firms remain a cash burning furnace. In the first half of 2025, OpenAI, owner of ChatGPT, generated $4.3 billion in revenue but spent $2 billion on sales and marketing and nearly $2.5 billion on stock-based equity compensation, posting an operating loss of $7.8 billion. Third, there are financial circularities seen during the dot com boom. CoreWeave, an equipment rental business trying to cash in the AI boom, purchases graphics processers in-demand for AI applications and rents them to users. Nvidia is an investor in the company, and the bulk of revenues is from a few customers. There is concern around CoreWeave’s accounting practices, especially the rate of depreciation of the chips, and its significant borrowings. In 2025, Nvidia, the backbone of the boom, agreed to invest $100 billion in OpenAI which in turn bought a similar dollar value of GPUs from it. Open AI proposed to invest in chipmakers AMD and Broadcom. There are side arrangements with Microsoft. Figure 1 sets out some of the complex interrelationships. Figure 1 AI Firm Inter-relationships and Cross-Investments This intricate web of linkages creates risks. They complicate ownership and create conflicts of interest. It was not clear how any of these commitments will work or be funded if they proceed. Open AI’s ability to finance these investments depends on continued access to new money from investors because it currently does not have the resources to meet many of these long-term obligations. These transactions distort financial performance. The firm selling capital goods reports sales and profits while the funding of the sale is treated as an investment. The buyer depreciates the cost over several years. Given that Nvidia seemingly upgrades its chip architecture regularly, depreciation periods of anywhere up to 5 years or longer seem optimistic. This means that dubious earnings boost share prices in a dizzying financial merry go round. The AI bubble, with its growing gap between expectations, investment and revenue potential, eerily resembles the 1990s. But it is much larger. Investment may be 17 times that of the 2000 dot com and four times the 2008 sub-prime housing bubble. AI’s acolytes deny any excess and argue that this time it is different because it is financed by equity capital. In fact, a large proportion is funded by debt with the amount tied to AI totalling around $1.2 trillion, 14 percent of all investment-grade debt. The funding pattern is intriguing. Hyperscalers, firms that build and operate large data centres providing on-demand cloud computing, storage, and networking services, such as Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Oracle, are providing much of funding alongside venture capital investors. These firms are currently spending around 60 percent of operating, not free, cash flow, on capital expenditure, the vast majority of which is to support AI projects. This is supplemented by borrowing, relying on their credit standings, to finance their investments. Increasingly, a significant proportion of the funding is being provided by private credit with. expected volumes as high as $800 billion over the next two years and $5.5 trillion through to 2035. Given the high return, high risk appetites of these lenders, the level of financial discipline applied to these loans remains uncertain. In effect, these large firm are now acting as financiers, borrowing money which is on-lent or invested in AI start-ups with unclear prospects. This exposure is troubling. Investor and lender assumptions that their exposure is to a strong firm is undermined where it is heavily invested in speculative AI ventures with unclear prospects. Microsoft’s share of Open AI’s losses is significant, over $4 billion in the latest quarter, representing around 12 percent of its pre-tax earnings. Oracle’s experience is salutary. The shares rose 25 percent when it announced a transaction to provide cloud computing facilities to OpenAI. The data centres do not currently exist and will have to be constructed. The transaction requires Oracle, which is significantly leveraged, to borrow funds to create these centres meaning that the firm is taking significant exposure to Open AI. As of December 2025, investor concern was palpable. Given its current net debt of over $100 billion which will need to increase substantially to finance the data centres, the cost of insuring against Oracle default rose sharply and presumably will flow through into the value of existing debt and the cost of future debt. A credit ratings downgrade from its current BBB, low investment grade, is possible, potentially to non-investment or junk grade. Its share price has fallen to levels around that before the announcement of the OpenAI transaction. While Microsoft, Meta and Amazon have stronger balance sheets, the risks are not dissimilar. The impact of the AI boom on the wider economy is material. AI companies account for 75-80 percent of US stock returns and earnings growth and 90 percent of capital expenditure growth. It has added around 40 percent or a full percentage point to 2025 US growth. Any retrenchment would affect the wider economy. It would also result in financial instability because of the direct and indirect exposure of banks and financial institutions to the AI sector. It is not inconceivable that some tech firms may require bailouts, such as that engineered for Intel, alongside familiar support for financiers, who will plead that without assistance the economy will collapse. Investors have convinced themselves that the greater risk is underinvesting not overinvesting. Amazon founder Jeff Bexos hails it a “good kind of bubble” arguing that the money spent will bring long-term returns and deliver gigantic benefits to society, the tech-bro’s persistent bromide. Investors should be cautious. In the 1990s telecoms and fibre optic cable bubble, investors drastically overestimated capacity required. The percentage of lit or used fibre-optic capacity today, much of it installed during the dot com boom, is around 50 per cent, and global average network utilisation is 26 percent. Investors believe that they have minimises risk by avoiding direct exposure to AI firms investing instead in firms like Nvidia, which provide the ‘picks and shovels’ of the revolution. The case of Cisco, for which the investment case during the halcyon days of the 1990 was similar, provides an interesting benchmark. It briefly became the world’s most valuable company on the largely correct assumption that its routers and other products would be crucial to the Internet. While the company’s financial performance has been generally steady, investors in Cisco lost out as its share price plummeted in 2000 only reaching the same level after 25 years. When the dot com boom ended, Microsoft, Apple, Oracle and Amazon fell 65, 80, 88 percent, and 94 percent respectively taking 16, 5, 14 and 7 years to recover their 2000 peaks. The economy slowed requiring government support and historically low interest rates, at the time, to sustain economy activity which set off the housing boom which resulted in the 2008 crisis. Consensual Tolkien-esque hallucinations notwithstanding, it would be surprising if the ending is different this time. © Satyajit Das 2025 All Right Reserved “…financiers, who will plead that without assistance the economy will collapse.” The other point to this claim is that, for an increasing percentage of the population, the economy has already collapsed. I really wonder if America can endure another round of financial bail-outs. The sheer scale of the malinvestment involved with this AI Bubble may make the governmental rescue of the financiers impossible this time. Is it possible to reach a point where the “socialization of the loses” leads to the demise of the society involved? We may finally discover the answer to the perennial question; “What came first, the goose or the golden egg?” via reverse financial engineering. Stay safe. Keep clipping those coupons. Apparently the riddle has been solved. Some particular kind of protein I believe was found in eggs that only exists in the chicken. Therefore the chicken had to come first in order to lay that egg, lol. I don’t know how politically either party survives a bailout of these foolish investments. All the little people get are cuts and pay more, and then you toss billions at companies that wasted all those resources? The feedback will be highly negative. I have been following the stock market valuation of Nvidia and Oracle to get a hint of when this mad bubble will burst as one makes the chips and the other the data centres (I have no money riding on those ponies, and this is not financial advice). Nvidia is currently down 10% from what looks like a peak in late October – early November and Oracle is down 40% from what looks like a peak in late September. Considering the amount of billions that need to be continously shovelled into this bubble I figure that when the line goes down enough the fear of losing will overtake the greed of “buying the dip” and the whole thing will come crashing down. But I could be wrong, I usually tend to err on the side of people should be able to see a bubble for what it is. I have been watching Nvidia too. Just to look. after so many people had drunk the AI kool-aid. My overwhelming cynicism prevents me from believing the hype. Last april when DEEPSEEK came out and Nvidia dropped to $94.. it seemed like reality was about to set in…. but then it climbed back up past the $188 mark…. a quick doubling of money…. damn.. Gold too… silver too.. Too bad I didn’t know the future, back then. .. the market really can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. .. The first crack in the Tower of Number Go Up may have appeared. Oracle posted its quarterly results and not only did it bigly miss the expected earnings, it spent far more than anyone had forecast. Oracle downplayed it by pointing to the 68 billion dollar increase in its future receivables due to the signing of large contracts. They said Stargate was progressing as expected which is nonsense: 2 of the 11 buildings which need to built and operational by June(!) have been built. OpenAI still doesn’t have the money to pay Oracle (or anyone else for that matter) and Oracle doesn’t have the 40 billion to buy all the GPU’s they need to provide. I expect we’ll soon see a lot more urgent messaging about how America is losing the AI race and that the government is going to have to loosen the purse strings lest the foreign menace wins and enslaves the losers. I think there’s a good chance OpenAI dies this year when it hits the wall of its debt. Or maybe Microsoft yawns and swallows Altman and friends before returning to its slumber. As Yves et al are fond of saying, pass the popcorn. The lights are dimming and the show will soon start. Gigantic benefits (per Bexos, hehe) from data-driven research, journalism(!) and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics and some routine administrative tasks? Will I still have to prepare the spaghetti al pesto, drink water instead of data, and pooh-pooh the usual? Scam Altman said the other day that chatbots are now “essential” to raise children. To me a clear indication of the bubbly state of AI. A problem barely touched here is the use of resources (electricity, water, raw materials), not to mention the externalities of climate change. Yet, according to some studies AI would (somehow) help to curb carbon emissions more than offsetting AI functioning related emissions. The article linked is an exercise of wishful thinking authored by some partner of a consulting company based in London. It is not a scientific article and cannot be even considered as data driven research. It is an exercise of magical thinking in which, somehow, AI gets in charge of everything and problems are solved. Seems like a self-licking ice cream cone. short text, machine-translation from German: Ones and zeros Can Large Language Models develop consciousness? By Daniel H. Rapoport https://archive.is/R5MS8 “(…) To assess whether LLMs can develop consciousness, we would need a rough understanding of what consciousness is. Unfortunately, no one possesses this understanding yet, not even a rough one. No psychologist, no philosopher, no pastor, and no biologist could say for sure what consciousness really is. We know only—purely phenomenologically, from a kind of self-evidence—that consciousness has something to do with inner experience. But we have also learned—both from simple optical illusions and from the enigmatic world of quantum mechanics—that the world is often quite different from how it appears to us. The self-evidence of the capacity for experience need not be as true and fundamental as it seems to us. Even if consciousness were something like an optical illusion, we would still like to know how it manages to generate an “inner experience.” If only to assess whether the potential to produce such illusions also lies dormant in LLMs (Low Life Mechanisms). (…)” …Shouldn’t we deal with Natural Stupidity (NS) first? oaf Excellent point – and nice to see you commenting! Given the ongoing enshittification of the Internet, how can LLMs not have an ever-decreasing signal-to-noise ratio? I have no tech knowledge whatsoever, but it just seems to follow from the models at work. A lot of ink to write “Ponzi scheme”….. Patrick Boyle did a more comprehensive review a month ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbL7yZCF-6Q and is very thoroughly researched including the power issues, not primarily stock prices. I wonder if AI helped write this paper: Even Das should know that Deepseek is FREE not cheaper “Several Chinese firms, such as DeepSeek, Moonshot as well as Bytedance and Alibaba, have developed cheaper models which cast doubts about the capital investment intensive approach of Western firms.” There is no competition with free (!!!!) there is competition potential with cheaper, sounds like one of those “hallucinations.” I took ‘cheaper’ to be in reference to Deepseek’s inference costs, which are reportedly a fraction of Chat GPT’s. Good, concise roundup of problems in the AI world, which are well known but cannot be repeated too often in the current information environment. This is a good paragraph (my emphasis): Cheerleaders miss that LLMs do not reason but are probabilistic prediction engines. A system which trawls existing data, even assuming that is correct, cannot create anything new. … Rather than fully generalisable intelligence, generative models are regurgitation engines… The emphasized points here are impossible to argue with, yet they are the death knell of the whole technology. Almost every claim for AI assumes that its output will be beyond anything humans have been able to do to date, yet it’s output will, at best, consist of precisely what humans have been able to do to date. However the following paragraph goes off the rails in my opinion (my emphasis, once again): AI models can take over certain labour-intensive tasks like data driven research, journalism and writing, travel planning, computer coding, certain medical diagnostics, testing and routine administrative tasks like handling standard customer service queries. Its loftier aims may prove elusive. Das acknowledges that AI produces strictly rote material that is unreliable, and unfixable. This precludes using it for anything where mistakes are not tolerable, which obviously includes anything safety-critical like research, medical diagnostics and computer coding, but also anything requiring imagination or creativity, or even just getting better over time, like journalism and writing, travel planning, administration, and interfacing with customers. In fact, it’s actually quite difficult to think of any task that’s worth doing, but where mistakes are of no consequence whatsoever. Thanks for this article. I have been skeptical about AI from day one. There isn’t anything about this technology that can be sustained over the long term such as the financing, electricity demand, water use, etc. I watched an interview the other day of Ed Zitron by Newsweek. Ed pointed out that AI doesn’t do much. It isn’t reliable, accurate, or effective in many of the tasks it is asked to do. I also read about the executive order that trump signed about AI last week and there has been speculation that AI will be bailed out by the government. So putting two and two together and dawning the tin foil hat, I do wonder if the government won’t end up using AI as part of the massive surveillance state apparatus that already exists. Huge amounts of surveillance data is available on everybody and AI will have a field day predicting who will commit the next crime. If AI gets the facts wrong, good luck to you proving that you didn’t commit the crime you are accused of. Jury trials are going away in some cases in the UK. What better justification to keep America “safe”. I appreciate the fine summary of many points that have exposed gen AI as average as in mediocre. I’ve never prompted an LLM or image diffuser for the following reason: Intelligence can’t exist without goals. AI’s don’t have goals. Therefore I’d just be looking at algorithm generated words and pictures. I keep coming back to kaleidoscopes as an analogy. A marvelously large number of possible patterns generated almost magically but hardly worth investing in. Chatbots, with the emphasis on “chat”, have become a tech marketers’ ultimate dream product – pornography (artificial engagement) to meet all one’s social needs, not just the erotic ones.

Title: Former Meta integrity chief says new report reveals ‘disappointing’ ad fraud epidemic at the social-media giant
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/12/15/former-meta-integrity-chief-ad-fraud-epidemic-china-scams/
Time Published: 2025-12-15T20:08:17Z
Full Content:
A sweeping Reuters investigation has put a price tag on Meta’s tolerance for ad fraud: billions of dollars a year. For Rob Leathern, a former Meta executive who led the company’s business integrity operations until 2019, the findings expose a stark tension between revenue growth and consumer harm. The report, published Monday, found that Meta generated roughly $18 billion in advertising revenue from China in 2024, around 10% of its global revenue, even as internal documents showed that nearly one-fifth of that (about $3 billion) came from ads tied to scams, illegal gambling, pornography, and other prohibited activity. Meta internally labeled China its top “scam exporting nation,” accounting for 25% of all scam and banned-product ads globally, according to the report. Meta’s core social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp) are blocked in China, but the company still earns billions from Chinese advertisers targeting global users. The investigation, Leathern told Fortune, illuminates several issues with both Meta and the broader Chinese ad market. “It appears that a variety of business partners that Meta has are not conducting themselves in an ethical way and/or there are employees of those companies that are not doing what they’re supposed to be doing,” he said. “It’s quite telling that Meta took down its entire partner directory, which obviously means that they must be reviewing their partners, and there’s a lot of them.” A Meta spokesperson told Fortune in a statement: “Scams are spiking across the internet, driven by persistent criminals and sophisticated, organized crime syndicates constantly evolving their schemes to evade detection. We are focused on rooting them out by using advanced technical measures and new tools, disrupting criminal scam networks, working with industry partners and law enforcement, and raising awareness on our platforms about scam activity. And when we determine that bad actors have violated our rules prohibiting fraud and scams, we take action.” Meta communications chief Andy Stone, however, pushed back on the investigation, posting on Threads, “Once again, Reuters is misconstruing and misrepresenting the facts.” He argued that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s “integrity strategy pivot”—which included instructing the China ads-enforcement team to reportedly “pause” its work—was to improve teams’ goals and “instruct them to redouble efforts to fight frauds and scams globally, not just from specific markets.” Stone also claimed that these teams have “doubled their fraud and scam reduction goal and over the last 15 months, user reports of scam ads have declined by well over 50%.” The revelations published by Reuters echo—but far exceed—the AI-driven deepfake scheme earlier this year involving Goldman Sachs during which scammers used AI-generated videos of investment strategist Abby Joseph Cohen to lure retail investors into fraudulent WhatsApp groups via Instagram ads. Reuters’ reporting suggests Meta’s China-linked scam problem is not an edge case or a blind spot, but an allegedly known and lucrative segment of its advertising business. According to internal estimates cited by Reuters, Meta served as many as 15 billion “high-risk” fraudulent ads per day, generating roughly $7 billion annually. The company required a 95% confidence threshold before banning fraudulent advertisers; those falling below it were often allowed to continue operating, sometimes at higher fees. Meta also established a 0.15% revenue “guardrail” (about $135 million) as the maximum revenue it was willing to forgo to crack down on suspicious ads, even as it earned $3.5 billion every six months from ads deemed to carry “higher legal risk.” Internal decision-making was explicit. When enforcement staff proposed shutting down fraudulent accounts, internal documents reviewed by Reuters showed that Meta sought assurance that growth teams would not object “given the revenue impact.” Asked whether Meta would penalize high-spending Chinese partners running scams, the answer was reportedly “No,” citing “high revenue impact.” Internal assessments reportedly noted that revenue from risky ads would “almost certainly exceed the cost of any regulatory settlement,” effectively treating fines as a cost of doing business. In late 2024, Meta reinstated 4,000 second-tier Chinese ad agencies that had previously been suspended, unlocking $240 million in annualized revenue—roughly half of it tied to ads violating Meta’s own safety policies, according to the investigation. More than 75% of harmful ad spending, Reuters found, came from accounts benefiting from Meta’s partner protections. The company also disbanded its China-focused anti-scam team. An external audit commissioned by Meta from the Propellerfish Group reached a blunt conclusion when investigating fraud and scams on the platform: Meta’s “own behavior and policies” were promoting systemic corruption in China’s advertising ecosystem. Reuters reported that the company largely ignored the findings and expanded operations anyway. Leathern, who reviewed the reporting and internal figures referenced in the report, told Fortune the scale of the problem was difficult to defend. “I was disappointed that the violation rates for the China-specific advertisers were as high as they were in the last year,” he said. “It’s disappointing, because there are ways to make it lower.” His critique goes to the heart of the failure. Platforms, he said, should hold intermediary agencies accountable for the quality of advertisers they bring in. “If you’re measuring violation rates coming from certain partners, and those rates are above a threshold every quarter or every year, you can just fire your worst-performing customers,” he said. “I think it’s important for us to have some sense of transparency into how policies are being enforced and what companies are doing in terms of reducing scams on their platforms,” Leathern added. Over the past 18 months, Meta has removed or rejected more than 46 million advertisements placed via so-called resellers, or large Chinese ad firms. And more than 99% of ad accounts associated with resellers found to be violating the company’s fraud policies were proactively detected and disabled. Aside from a need for transparency, Leathern warned that prioritizing short-term revenue over trust ultimately threatens the business itself. “If people don’t trust advertisers, advertising, it reduces the effectiveness of that channel for all advertisers,” he said. “There’s a lot of risk to their business, directly and indirectly, from not doing a good enough job on stopping scams.” The human cost is already visible. Reuters documented victims across North America and Asia, including U.S. and Canadian investors who lost life savings to fake stock and crypto ads, Taiwanese consumers misled into buying counterfeit health products, and a Canadian Air Force recruiter whose Facebook account was hijacked to run crypto scams. Meta’s own internal safety staff estimated the company’s platforms were “involved” in roughly one-third of all successful U.S. scams, linked to more than $50 billion in consumer losses. The problem is intensifying as generative AI lowers the barrier for scammers. “You can create something that looks plausible far more easily than ever before,” Leathern said. “The speed and adaptability of criminals and their use of AI tools just makes the environment far more tricky.” Yet Leathern said platforms like Meta have not been sufficiently transparent about how aggressively they are using those same tools to fight abuse. “We just don’t have a ton of insight into what they’re doing to reduce scams and fraud coming in through ads,” he said. For Leathern, the investigation should be a turning point. “I hope they see this as an opportunity to improve things for people,” he said.

Title: This Analyst Sees Nvidia at $8.5 Trillion Next Year. Is It Even Possible?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © alengo / E+ via Getty Images Analyst price targets on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock were initially all over the place. The rally has continued for over 3 years, with both revenue still growing at breakneck speeds. Some analysts are now making bolder moves and are starting to coalesce near even more ambitious targets. The highest such recent price target projects NVDA stock at $352 next year. This implies a massive 101% leap from here and comes from Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis. This analyst has an excellent history of making winning calls, with 69% of his ratings being successful, with an average return per rating of 28.3% over the past year. This is exceptionally good, and puts him at #32 out of over 10,000 tracked Wall Street analysts. Should you take this rating seriously? Let’s take a look. On November 20, Lipacis lifted his price target on NVDA stock from $261 to $352. He used the company’s inventory buildup “to support large orders” as his rationale for the price target increase. This may look counterintuitive at first, as a bigger inventory usually means products are not being sold. However, the rising inventory is viewed bullishly because Nvidia itself has said they’re building up to meet unprecedented AI compute demand, not excess supply. Their backlog for 2025 and 2026 is at $500 billion, with the company’s CFO saying that even this is tentative and could be an underestimate due to constant demand from hyperscalers. Lipacis believes revenue growth could accelerate to 79% by mid-2026. If this happens, Wall Street is likely to slap a higher premium on NVDA stock. The current forward price-earnings ratio of 23 times makes NVDA stock cheaper than Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) at 33 times and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at 63 times. Nvidia’s competitors have failed to make ground. Many other AI chipmakers have cost-effective products, but they pale in comparison to what Nvidia has to offer. Nvidia essentially has the AI chip market locked inside its walled garden. It is very difficult and expensive for any major hyperscaler to switch from Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem to another one. Nvidia has been making it even harder with the recent CUDA tiles update that will get developers even more hooked. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek tried training its upcoming model with Huawei’s AI chips but failed. It reportedly ended up reverting to Nvidia’s chips. This failure likely cost DeepSeek the momentum it built up earlier this year with its R1 model. Other AI companies are unlikely to start tinkering around with their AI chip suppliers at scale, since a failure that sets back a company just a few months could cost them dearly. All of this means that Nvidia is unlikely to give up its lead anytime soon. It’s going exceedingly well for Nvidia, but the rally won’t go on forever. Even if Nvidia has a large lead in the market, the ongoing “AI revolution” will dictate what happens to NVDA stock. If the buildout continues for years and years, Nvidia will climb along with it. That seems to be what Lipacis is betting on. At the same time, hyperscalers don’t have infinite cash to throw at AI chips. Companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making headway with their own AI chips to use in-house and avoid the margins on Nvidia’s chips. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is not a hyperscaler, but the AI spending has already evaporated its net cash position, and it is now in net debt. Nvidia could either end up like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and trade sideways or Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), where it gives up almost all of its gains once this AI buildout ends. Only time will tell, so it’s still a good idea to keep around 10-15% of your portfolio in NVDA. If you are already at that level, I wouldn’t snap up more unless you get a bigger discount.

Title: Microsoft shares slide 5% in just two weeks, as Google leapfrogs the firm into third place by market cap — and yes, it's all to do with AI

Microsoft’s stumble is Google’s opening. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Microsoft's share price took a battering over the past couple of weeks, what's going on? Yesterday, someone linked me an AI-generated article alleging that Xbox's near-total absence from The Game Awards was to blame for a multi-billion decreases in its stock price. It was a cute idea, but simply not based in reality. Microsoft's share price has slid around 7% in the past month, although it's still up 5% for the year in total, and up over 120% across the past five years. One of the big success stories for CEO Satya Nadella has been a reignition of Microsoft's stock market performance, but the stock is behaving a little odd over the past few weeks. No, investors do not care that Xbox wasn't present at The Game Awards, especially not to the tune of over $170 billion in lost market capitalization — likely worth more than all of Xbox itself. Microsoft's share price has slid owing to a conflux of various AI-related reasons, both directly and indirectly, as investors get nervous about Microsoft's position. Microsoft's stock price slide is a combination of various factors, all directly and indirectly related to its position in artificial intelligence. AI is driving the stock market right now, with companies like NVIDIA, Meta, and Oracle all dominating the space. Microsoft's own position, partnered with OpenAI, helped drive the firm to second place for global market capitalization, behind only NVIDIA. NVIDIA's server tech is powering everything from cloud compute to AI workloads right now, and companies like Microsoft and Amazon are re-selling NVIDIA GPUs and other products so firms can build out their own AI aspirations. Microsoft isn't really an innovator in the AI space, relying on OpenAI's models to deliver its products. One big fear investors have lately revolves around whether the frenzy to deliver AI will actually produce a return on investment. Companies like Oracle and Broadcom have seen large stock market slides recently, after their earnings and forecasts thoroughly underwhelmed Wall Street. Broadcom dropped by 11% — driven by the disappointment over its purported "backlog" of $73 billion worth of compute orders. Broadcom, Oracle, OpenAI, and various other companies have been relying on "commitments to buy" lately, but have been unable to actually deliver compute owing to a variety of issues. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. There are huge and increasing demands for computing power from various AI companies, particularly those that rely on NVIDIA's stack. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently warned in an interview that he has GPUs sitting on the shelf because the electricity physically isn't available yet. The United States power grid literally can't meet demand for the hyperscalers, which is spooking investors into thinking we might have hit an upper limit in the near term for how fast server infrastructure brokers can grow. Companies like Microsoft and Google have been aggressively researching efficiency to offset some of these bottle necks. OpenAI has also increased the efficiency of its models in a universe where compute isn't scaling fast enough to meet demand, but investors seem concerned that the business models associated with AI might never produce a return on investment. Broadcom and Oracle both spooked investors with capital expenditure warnings, as firms race to meet the computational needs of companies like OpenAI and Anthropic. Oracle, which has become an AI-first company all up in recent years, missed both revenue and profit projections, and warned that its capex burn would be 2026 would be $15 billion higher than its prior projections. It also reported negative cash flow, as its AI business fails to actually generate tangible profits. Investors rewarded them with a sharp sell-off to the tune of around 11%. Microsoft's diversified business insulates it to some degree from these types of spikes, but not completely. Investors are increasing re-evaluating AI infrastructure spend, as valuations spiral out of control that seems incongruent with reality. For Microsoft in particular, the fact Google Gemini's latest Pro models beat OpenAI's in most, if not all benchmarks, increasingly paints Alphabet as a frontrunner. Google also controls more of the tech stack, with home-grown Tensor server infrastructure, eliminating some of the costs associated with working with companies like NVIDIA. Microsoft has also reportedly cut internal goals and forecasts, as consumers and companies alike seem unwilling to spend money on its AI products. There's other factors at play, too. State attorney generals in the United States sent Microsoft and other AI players a letter, warning them to fix "delusional" hallucinations and sycophancy, after a string of high-profile "AI psychosis" cases where the tech fed dangerous ideations to vulnerable people. Regulation protects people (at least in theory), but is often thought to harm profitability (oh no!). It's easy to clown on Microsoft Copilot. Its lacklustre features in Notepad, MS Paint, Microsoft Photos, and other Microsoft products just screams of haphazardry and poor execution. The firm doesn't seem to know what role AI could, or should play within Windows 11 consumer-grade features and products, despite desires to turn Windows 12 into an agentic AI-first OS (much to the annoyance of users). Where Copilot is winning seems to be within enterprise grade solutions. Creating regulatory-compliant AI solutions for law firms and financial service institutions seems to be forming a winning solution for Microsoft, where centralized and IT-monitored solutions shine for companies that are already embedded in Microsoft Azure. Github Copilot has also been something of a success story too, offering programmers a more accessible alternative to Anthropic's Claude. Increasingly, though, investors think Google might emerge as the front runner for the tech and its implementation. Slow out of the gate, Google's early AI efforts simply served to hurt its own search engine dominance and make a mockery out of itself with notorious summary hallucinations and errors. A couple of years later, Google Gemini Pro and Nano Banana image generation tools are now largely superior to OpenAI, evaporating Microsoft's early advantages in a single month. Google has now leapfrogged Microsoft in market capitalization value, as of writing, slipping up into third place, as Microsoft sinks to fourth. Apple has ironically strengthened its position by ditching its laughable home-grown AI attempts, and opting to leverage Google's instead for its own Siri "Copilot" assistant and other AI features. Microsoft's own solutions have effectively been squeezed out of phones, potentially forever. Microsoft, without a phone platform to call its own, is once again forced to rely entirely on Windows and enterprise to push its own AI products. Windows remains a dominant fixture in computing, but hate of Windows 11 has gone fully mainstream. More and more companies and even governments are embracing open source solutions, Linux, and other alternatives over Microsoft's own. Apple and Google have effectively locked Microsoft out of mobile computing entirely, flanked by CEO Satya Nadella's short-sighted decision to stop investing in Windows Phone. A ~5% slide isn't anything too shocking, but like Time Magazine's snub of Microsoft — it's symbolic of changing winds on the frontiers of AI. Microsoft dominated the conversation for the past two years, but once again, its old rival Google seems poised to take pole position.

Time Published: 2025-12-15T00:05:00Z

In 2025, Donald Trump's erratic, unlawful policies upended the postwar era of globalization and set in motion a process that will culminate in America's loss of global primacy. Not only are the sources of US economic strength being destroyed, but all other countries are de-risking from America as fast as they can. NEW YORK – It has become almost routine to end each year with talk of the “polycrisis,” and to acknowledge the difficulty of anticipating a future that seems pregnant with the risk of new wars, pandemics, financial crises, and climate-driven devastation. Yet 2025 added a uniquely toxic ingredient to this mix: the return to the White House of Donald Trump, whose erratic, unlawful policies have already upended the postwar era of globalization. Faced with so much chaos and uncertainty, can we say anything with confidence about where the US and global economies are heading? One thing we can say is that the US economy is not doing as well as Trump, ever the con man, would have us believe. Job creation is almost at a standstill, which is no surprise, given that Trump has been sowing uncertainty and weakening the economy in unprecedented ways. On the supply side, his most pernicious policy has been the frontal attack on immigrant workers (and American workers with darker complexions more broadly). The administration’s mass deportations – carried out by masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents snatching people off the streets – have killed off the most important source of additional labor supply at a time when the domestic labor force is declining. This matters for everyone, because not only do Americans depend on immigrants in industries ranging from agriculture and construction to hospitality and care work, but these immigrants are also a source of demand. Yet now, many Americans of color, even US citizens, are afraid to leave their homes, lest they be abducted and brutalized by ICE. The negative effects of Trump’s indiscriminate cuts to government have also spread throughout the economy. There are multiplier effects to government contractions, just as there are to expansions, and in the current context, the costs have been amplified by the erratic nature of the process. The administration’s incompetent, blunderbuss approach has sown even deeper uncertainty and induced precautionary behavior on the part of businesses and consumers. Trump’s tariffs – whether levied or threatened – and other on-again, off-again policies should be recognized for what they are: a major supply-side shock to the economy. They have pointlessly added uncertainty to the costs of production and to the prices consumers pay when they shop, making it impossible for businesses to engage in any serious long-term planning. And these are just short-term effects. The US economy’s long-term prospects look even bleaker, all thanks to Trump. After all, America’s comparative advantage has always rested on technology and unfettered higher education. By attacking research and trying to starve universities of federal funds unless they kowtow to his demands, Trump is shooting America’s economy in the foot. As numerous Nobel laureates in economics have emphasized, the “wealth of nations” lies in institutions, not least the rule of law. But Trump is trampling on the rule of law and replacing it with an extortionary regime of deal-making (and self-dealing), where government favors (like export licenses for Nvidia or subsidies for Intel) are granted in exchange for stakes in the company’s future profits. Of course, over time, Trump’s targets for extortion will dwindle. Having recognized the danger of relying on the United States, many countries are already pursuing new trade arrangements. Why, then, is GDP still growing (though not as robustly as it did under President Joe Biden), with the stock market reaching new highs and inflation remaining below the levels critics had warned about? There are multiple explanations for this apparent strength. With respect to the stock market, the boom is actually very narrow, confined largely to a handful of tech giants: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.

(This is especially true for Tesla, owing to Elon Musk’s embrace of Trump, which has alienated many consumers.) I am among the many commentators who see today’s valuations as the product of a bubble, one that has been sustaining not only the stock market but the entire economy. The massive capital expenditures on AI have been offsetting the weakness in the rest of the economy. But like all such bubbles, this one will eventually burst. Precisely when is anyone’s guess; but with so much of the economy riding on one sector, the collapse will inevitably be felt widely. Worse, if AI succeeds in the way its advocates anticipate, it would be a harbinger of other serious problems, because then the technology would likely displace many workers and cause even greater inequality. Add the downsizing of government demanded by Silicon Valley’s ersatz tech-libertarians, and one can only wonder what would sustain the US economy in the years ahead. As for inflation, there is a simple explanation for why it has not risen sharply yet. For starters, Trump’s tariffs generally have not been as high as he originally threatened (though the 50% punitive tariff imposed on India, a country the US had treated as a friend before Trump’s return, is shockingly brutal). Moreover, the effects of tariffs are often felt with long lags. Many firms refrained from raising prices until they saw what their competitors would do, and some won’t raise prices until the inventories of the goods they purchased before the tariffs are exhausted. But if Trump’s threatened tariffs against China were ever actually imposed, that would be a different matter. In fact, the unraveling of supply chains could unleash price increases greater than the tariffs themselves. That brings me to the critical question: What country would willingly subject itself to the whims of a mad king? It is not as if the US has a stranglehold on the supply of critical minerals or rare earths, without which the modern industrial age crumbles. It is not as if there aren’t markets elsewhere. The law of supply and demand works just as well without the US as with it. As Adam Smith and David Ricardo taught us, economic growth is about leveraging comparative advantages and economies of scale. But as Trump (and Russian President Vladimir Putin) has taught us, relying on unreliable trade partners can be enormously disadvantageous. Besides, the US is not as important as it used to be. It now accounts for under 10% of global exports. While some firms’ profits will suffer in a post-American global economy, others will benefit. While some workers will have to find alternative employment, others will find new demand for their skills. To be sure, the short run will not be easy. But in the new global economy that emerges over the longer term, America will have lost its hegemony. That is where we are heading as we head into the second year of living at the mercy of an unhinged president’s whims. The transition has already begun, and though global growth will suffer, the pain may be less than many fear. In Europe, for example, investments in rearmament – another byproduct of Trump’s self-destructive policies – will provide a major boost. Perhaps the defining moment will come with the 2026 US midterm elections in November. Elections that are not as free and fair as one would expect for a genuine democracy (as many fear) would mark a grim turning point. But if the growing dissatisfaction with Trump’s economic management and the country’s slide toward authoritarianism results in the Democrats recapturing at least one house of Congress, that will be a turning point in the other direction. Either way, the US and the world would still face at least another two years of economic incompetence and uncertainty. Nov 28, 2025 Janine R.

Title: Does Meta Need a Decade of Efficiency?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © David Ramos / Getty Images Mark Zuckerberg declared 2023 the “year of efficiency” after Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) shed 21,000 employees and tightened spending. Operating margins expanded from 25% to 42%, and the stock tripled. But Meta guided capital expenditures to $70-72 billion for 2025, up from $30 billion in 2024. That’s an arms race. Third quarter revenue hit $51.24 billion, up 26% year-over-year. Operating income reached $20.54 billion at a 40% margin. Net income collapsed 83% to $2.71 billion due to a $15.93 billion one-time tax charge. Strip that out and adjusted earnings would be $18.64 billion. Capital spending surged 135% to $19.37 billion in a single quarter. Zuckerberg laid out the logic on the Q3 earnings call: It’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years, so I think we should invest more there […] our AI investments continue to require serious infrastructure, and I expect to continue investing significantly there too. That’s the CEO explicitly saying “we should invest more,” not “we should maintain efficiency.” Meta is training Llama 4 on a cluster exceeding 100,000 H100 GPUs, larger than anything competitors have disclosed. CFO Susan Li warned of “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth” for 2026 as depreciation and operating costs from the expanded fleet hit the income statement. Meta’s 40% operating margin exceeds Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) at 30.5%. The company’s 82% gross margin provides cushion. Meta AI now has 500 million monthly active users, and AI-driven feed improvements drove an 8% increase in Facebook time spent and 6% on Instagram. Over one million advertisers used generative AI tools to create 15 million ads last month, with a 7% lift in conversions. But if infrastructure spending doubles while revenue growth holds at 26%, something has to give. Operating expenses are projected at $116-118 billion for 2025, up 22-24%. Reality Labs losses continue to widen. The company is adding costs everywhere AI touches. The market is pricing in a return to efficiency. Meta trades at 22x forward earnings, down from 29x trailing, implying analysts expect margin recovery. The consensus price target of $838 suggests 12% upside. But quarterly earnings growth just printed at negative 83%, even adjusted for the tax charge. Meta doesn’t need a decade of efficiency. It needs the AI buildout to pay off within three years, or margins will compress. Zuckerberg is betting the infrastructure spend creates a moat competitors can’t match. The alternative is he’s just spending more efficiently than before while still spending a lot more. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

Title: Meta (META) Stock Pops Following Metaverse Cuts Announcement – Could it Hit $1,000 In 2026?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) has faced criticism for investing too heavily in the Metaverse, but the company’s broader business has continued to perform well. During a recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast, 24/7 Analysts Eric Bleeker and Austin Smith discussed whether the announced cutbacks on the Metaverse could help generate even greater returns for Meta in 2026. The recent announcement that Meta will be acquiring the AI wearable company Limitless has signaled to many a strategic shift toward AI-focused opportunities. Some believe that if Meta executes well, shares could rise toward $900, potentially even $1,000 per share. “I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets,” Smith explained. “That’s what you get with a founder, CEO, who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out.” Bleeker added, “If you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline.” If the video embed isn’t working, you can access the full video at the following URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/14/meta-meta-stock-pops-following-metaverse-cuts-announcement-could-it-hit-1000-in-2026 This conversation was from our most recent episode of The AI Investor Podcast. In the show we invest $500,000 portfolio filled with our top AI stock ideas.

If you’re a Meta investors, getting the full story on the biggest developments in AI is absolutely essential, so don’t delay! Austin Smith: Meta has had its own anchor. Now that’s weird to say for a company whose shares have performed as well as they have, and Meta’s a bigger company than the Metaverse. But when you think about the one big criticism that people have had of Meta in the last few years, it’s been why is Mark Zuckerberg flushing so much money down the metaverse drain? Nobody believes in it. The traction has been really low. So Meta has a lot more going for it than that, and that’s been enough to overwhelm that one core criticism. But that has been the biggest criticism I’ve heard, and frankly, it’s a criticism I share. I really like that Zuckerberg is willing to make these big bets. That’s what you get with a founder CEO who is visionary in the way that he is. But you also gotta know when to fold them, right? And the Metaverse has just not been working out. So Meta finally announcing that they’re cutting some of the revenue out of that division. Wall Street rewarded it. I think they should. That’s the right call. Anything you saw in this that’s interesting? Just cutting out from that tiny anchor and saying, “Hey, Metaverse, this capital has a higher return for the company and a shorter path to revenue: AI,” right? AI internally, AI externally, it’s clearly a better place to deploy that money. Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Well, if we are doing Glengarry Glen Ross, you know, what is it? The winner gets a car. The second place gets steak knives and last gets fired. If you looked at the Magnificent Seven this year, Google is the car, NVIDIA gets the steak knives. Google’s up 70%, NVIDIA’s up 35%. And then the laggards are some combination of Microsoft, Apple, Meta, and Amazon – up zero to 15% – all slightly underperforming the S&P. Meta has been disappointing, especially from where we purchased it. I have wanted to move out of the portfolio. The problem is, if you go back and look at Meta’s stock the past two years, it’s a very tight range. They’re trading between 20 and 30 times forward earnings. And right now, they’re at the bottom of that valuation. It’s because the market doesn’t believe in them specifically. They were sold off very harshly because of how high their operating costs are rising last quarter. We’ve got two sides to Meta. One is that AI has more potential to drive their business than any other company. I believe there’s a study that generative AI leads to 19% better click-through rates on ads, which is going to make their products better. They’re going to be able to create new products. We know the ROI. But if they’re spending so much in this rush for ASI and they’re behind in those efforts, investors aren’t going to believe in that narrative. So I’ve wanted to see them rise to higher, closer to that 30 times forward earnings multiple, like Google’s closer to right now, before I sell it off and redeploy that cash. This is a great step in that direction. They need to be cutting some costs. They need to show the market they have discipline. And we saw the day they announced this, they were up 4%. So if you’re someone who owns Meta, this is objectively positive. If we can see this discipline from them, and if AI continues to boost their business results, there’s an opportunity for shares to trade closer to $900 per share this year. That would be a very bullish case. On the flip side, if they continue spending in ways Wall Street doesn’t like, you could see them trading as low as $500 per share, the low end of their baseline. We’ll see where they trade, which depends a lot on how they handle this cost discipline throughout the year. Austin Smith: It’s interesting to talk about cost discipline in a world where Meta is also being punished for spending so much on AI. But this is what cost discipline is, right? If they believe in AI and the ROI on Metaverse isn’t there, they need to cut in one category and move that money to the other. And they’re doing that. Just yesterday, Meta announced they’re acquiring an AI wearable company, Limitless. It’s not a big acquisition in terms of total dollars, but it shows that they are reducing the thing that’s not working and putting more money in the thing that is working, which is AI. That is good financial discipline. Whether or not the AI bets pay off is the next Meta question that Wall Street has, but at least they are not sticking poorly with the Metaverse bet.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Shutterstock Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has assembled a strategic portfolio of public investments in AI-focused companies, including chip designers, data center operators, and infrastructure providers that not many investors are aware of. It consists of six holdings that at the end of the third quarter was valued at approximately $3.84 billion. The dominant position is in CoreWeave (NASDAQ:CRWV), the AI-specialized cloud provider that relies heavily on Nvidia GPUs and accounts for over 86% of the portfolio’s value. Nvidia invested $350 million in CoreWeave in two tranches before its March IPO. Having originally invested $100 million in April 2023, it invested another $250 million just before its public debut, giving it a total of approximately 24.2 million shares at $40 per share, securing a 7% stake for Nvidia. Following the IPO, CoreWeave surged to an all-time high of $187 per share in June, but has been on a fairly steady decline since. Despite almost doubling from the IPO price, the stock is down nearly 60% from that peak. On Friday, it suffered another 10% drop, bringing its market capitalization to around $39 billion — a sharp erosion from the nearly $80 billion it was worth at the end of June. Friday’s plunge followed an SEC Form 4 filing revealing that Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal sold 66,467 shares on December 11 at an average price of $82.58, totaling approximately $5.49 million. While investors are often reminded to ignore insider sales because they can sell stock for any reason — or no reason at all — those made by CFOs should be noted because of their specialized knowledge of the company’s finances. However, Agrawal’s transaction stemmed from the vesting of restricted stock units, with the sale covering associated tax withholding obligations. Insider sales are common upon RSU vesting and often serve administrative purposes rather than signaling fundamental concerns. This was a non-event for CoreWeave, and Agrawal still owns over 203,000 shares after the sale. Yet, CoreWeave’s challenges reflect broader skepticism about the AI sector’s growth trajectory. Analysts and investors have highlighted potential “circular financing” dynamics, where Nvidia provides investments or capacity commitments to customers that purchase its hardware. CoreWeave’s arrangement with Nvidia includes a $6.3 billion agreement under which Nvidia commits to purchasing any unsold cloud computing capacity through April 2032, providing a revenue backstop but raising questions about true end-user demand. Across the industry, major technology companies are increasingly relying on debt to fund expansive AI infrastructure projects as operational cash flows prove insufficient. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) issued $30 billion in bonds in 2025 to support data center expansions, and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) just faced investor backlash after its Q3 earnings. Its stock dropped 15% on concerns over ballooning debt levels that exceed $100 billion and negative free cash flow tied to AI commitments. These developments have fueled debates about overinvestment risks, potential capacity gluts, and the long-term profitability of AI buildouts. For CoreWeave, despite reporting strong Q3 revenue of $1.36 billion (up significantly year-over-year) and a substantial backlog, the company posted ongoing net losses and relies heavily on debt financing, including a $2.6 billion convertible notes offering completed just this month, albeit at a low 1.75% interest rate. High capital expenditures for data center expansion — projected to be in the tens of billions of dollars over the coming years — are seen as straining its balance sheet. CoreWeave is the primary drag on Nvidia’s investment portfolio performance. Although five of the six holdings have declined since the end of Q3 — contributing to a significant overall drop in portfolio value — CoreWeave’s 42% decline has been roughly twice as severe as the next-largest loser, Nebius Group (NASDAQ:NBIS), which is down 22%. Only Applied Digital (NASDAQ:APLD) has recorded gains during this period. Analysts maintain a generally positive outlook on CoreWeave, though, citing its revenue growth, customer relationships, and backlog as supportive factors. However, a sustained recovery hinges on demonstrating profitable execution, managing leverage effectively, and proving that enduring AI demand exists in the face of financing and sustainability doubts. Until it can demonstrate this, I wouldn’t be buying into CoreWeave just yet. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.

By The Knowledge Project Podcast ## Key takeaways - **Doorman Fallacy**: Management consultants replace a doorman costing $X with an automatic door, saving money short-term, but the hotel's reputation crashes because the doorman provided security, taxi hailing, guest recognition, and status—value not captured in 'open the door' metrics. [04:43], [05:29] - **Postman Brand Perception**: Royal Mail found brand affection uncorrelated with service reliability; it depended on liking the postman, who built trust through chats and favors, outweighing metrics like delivery speed. [07:26], [08:15] - **Cold Beer Transaction Utility**: Thaler’s experiment shows people pay more for identical cold beer from a boutique hotel than a shack due to transaction utility—how good the deal feels—independent of the beer's utility. [18:11], [19:30] - **Dyson Call Center Honor**: James Dyson halted efficiency metrics presentation, insisting calls be treated as an honor; staff solved problems helpfully, even free parts next day, building fanatical loyalty despite premium prices. [40:47], [41:20] - **Family Firms Outperform PLCs**: Privately-owned family firms like McCain, Yorkshire Tea, and Dyson dominate advertising effectiveness awards over PLCs, prioritizing long-term customer value over short-term shareholder transactions. [28:28], [32:23] - **Psychopath Detection Test**: Women arrive late on first dates as a test; psychopaths rage while normals say 'traffic was terrible,' revealing character since we evolved to judge trustworthiness over half a million years. [20:43], [22:04] I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with a perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-m along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising. It's marketing and it's advertising. It's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And do you think we're marketing. And do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? >> We usually do. And so, you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. >> What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? >> I think a large part of it comes down to So, we first we were talking about this in the elevator. It was nine years ago. She back when podcasting wasn't even a thing. >> We must be able to dig out the original content presumably. Yeah. content presumably. Yeah. >> What was it? It was your podcast number 47 or something, was it? >> Oh, no. I think it was like 16 or something. Really? It was really low. something. Really? It was really low. We'll have to dig out the number, but uh it's been a long time since then. >> Oh, fabulous. Yeah. >> And and podcasting has exploded. I've been following Farum Street devotedly. >> Appreciate that. Um and uh it's always always interesting very very interesting on and I mean the whole question of the decision sciences uh is I think at the moment completely critical and actually by the way it'll be very very interesting with AI because I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with the perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that at the very least you'll have to show them three or four or five skiing holidays from which they choose because we can't really choose in the absence of comparison. It's what do you see what I mean? It's a sort of freakish element of free market capitalism which is we can only like something if we choose it in preference to something else. >> That's interesting. How does that relate to like a travel agency which would do that inherently? Like if you said I'm that inherently? Like if you said I'm going to India to chat GPT and you're like plan it for me versus you go to a travel agency and you're like I'm going to India plan it for me. Well among real estate agents there's apparently a kind of little bit of a trick which is you always in before you show someone the house you want to sell them. You show them a less appropriate house, ideally that's slightly more expensive, say, so that when they see the house that you want to sell them, it's now clearcut because they can say, "Ooh, it's a bit cheaper than the other one and it's got a conservatory." a conservatory." >> There's contrast. >> So there's a kind of decoy effect, a bit like the famous economist experiment with a decoy effect. So, you know, well, you know, one of my interesting questions is, you know, what interface will AI deploy to help us make choices and will it make the mistake that you could very easily make? If you think about it, nobody clicked the I'm feeling lucky button on Google. I think it's still there, isn't it? It's been there for years and they've removed it and found that it slightly reduces the appeal, but the number of people who actually click it, i.e., I'm feeling lucky, take me straight to a single page, is vanishingly small. people want to choose between, you know, effectively above the fold options. And um so, you know, I'm just intrigued because it's very very easy, I think, for people with an economic or tech background to make assumptions about what people are trying to do and how they choose and that we're, you know, utility maximizers and all this kind of thing only really to be completely wrong. Do you think we're looking for wrong. Do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? We usually do uh in the sense that when you pursue efficiency there are quite a few problems. But when you pursue efficiency generally you start looking at numerical or mechanical factors and of course in the process you disregard psychological factors where the greater gains may be found and so you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. I mean, one of the greatest creation. I mean, one of the greatest forms of efficiency, by the way, is employing a human being who's really, really nice. Now, this is complete really nice. Now, this is complete anathema to people in tech who love to define business processes so as to make them susceptible to automation. You know, person X does this. We will take that function, we will replace it with algorithm Y. And it's a very beguiling message because it usually comes with cost savings attached. You might have heard savings attached. You might have heard of my thing, the Dorman fallacy. Did you >> remind >> I'll remind the viewers and listeners uh which is simply that you know you you have a hotel it's a five-star hotel it has a dormant someone who welcomes incoming guests you know a combination of say McKenzie or Accenture and a tech firm will come in and say your dorman currently costs you $X,000 a year we have defined his or her function as opening the door we will replace said dorman with automatic door opening mechanism and an infrared human detector and we'll save you 30 $40,000 a year and then they walk away. They take the credit for the costsaving and then two years later, you know, the hotel's a catastrophe. The rack rates fallen off a cliff because the dorman was doing multiple things, many of which were human and kind of tacit. Security would be one. You know, there are no vagrants to sleep in the doorway, hailing taxis, dealing with luggage, recognizing regular guests, providing status to the hotel. There are loads and loads of value creation components to that dorman which aren't captured in the open the door definition. >> Is that an example of where the costs are really visible, but the benefits are >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very easy management consulting firms uh if you if you're in a business and and some management consultants come in go to the management and say are they on a gain share agreement. A gain share agreement share agreement. A gain share agreement is a management consulting scam where you claim uh a certain percentage of the cost savings you identify in year one. Now as Roger L. Martin, your fellow Canadian and my own personal Svengali says, "Any idiot can cut costs." Okay. What takes real skill is cutting cost in a way that doesn't destroy value. One of the things that I don't think is understood by tech nerds and if I'm being really cruel, you know, males in general in in many cases is the extent to which in evaluating any business or experience, the human component of it, the face-to-face component does really really heavy lifting. And I've got a lovely story to illustrate this which I think is fantastic. It's the absolute perfect example of misalignment of optimization through quantification bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor used to be the marketing director of Royal Mail, but you know similar to what you have with Canada Post, right? USPS. >> Mhm. Sorry, not US. Yes, just USPS. And they couldn't make any sense of the fact that the brand perception of Royal Mail bore no relation to service levels. So there would be districts and areas where you know every single firstass letter arrived early the following day extraordinarily reliable levels of service and royal mail wasn't particularly held in affection or esteem. There were other areas where the esteem. There were other areas where the service was frankly a bit ropey and people seemed to love it. Now, this obviously upset them because they thought that all the billions or certainly hundreds of millions they'd invested in service quality improvement should translate into customer satisfaction and therefore, you know, some sort of brand voltage. And someone had a theory and they said, I think something else is going on. And the theory which was put to the test and proved absolutely right was that the major determinant of whether you liked royal male or not was whether you liked your postman or posty technically to be used the genderneutral term. >> So people who had a rather unreliable service but the postman did the odd favor for them left things in the porch had a chat with them. Okay, those people thought it was a brilliant organization regardless of the actual metrics that were being pursued. And I think that's very true in uh any service organization. You know, you may there's organization. You know, you may there's an electricity company, a gas company, a water company, a utility. You may interact with them online 95% of the time, but the one or two occasions where you interact by telephone or face to face disproportionately affect your your perception of the organization. And I've argued for quite a time if I were being completely honest, I've worked in advertising for 36 years. And if I were a wholly honest person, uh, without, you know, fear of annoying my colleagues, probably 50% of the time, I would advise to a client, take 10 to 20% of your marketing budget and spend it on upgrading the call center. Pay the people too much. Get the best practitioners. I think it's perfectly practitioners. I think it's perfectly legitimate. In some organizations, there legitimate. In some organizations, there should be the very best call center people should be on six figures because it makes if you're good and nice, that's how much difference it makes. In other words, it more or less makes. In other words, it more or less drowns out all your other stuff, all the other noise. If every time you have a other noise. If every time you have a personal experience, you have a good experience, then broadly speaking in the human brain, uh that's a good organization which I can trust. And when you think about it, I suddenly realize why this probably is. We don't really have much evolved experience in evaluating postal efficiency, do we? Okay, we have quart of a million half a million years of evolved experience in deciding who to like and trust because for most of our evolutionary, you know, existence, that was one of the most fi five most important questions to get right. You know, do I trust this person? right. You know, do I trust this person? You know, will they attack me? Are they an ally? Are they a foe? Uh if I pay them money, will they deliver? And so consequently, I think what we do in our brains is we use our human judgment as a proxy. >> Now, a story to back up that, you probably remember this, okay? It's in my book, Alchemy, which is imagine you're turning up to buy a secondhand car and you turn up at the house, nondescript house, and the car is parked outside the house and you have a look at the car and you judge the, you know, whether the pedals are worn and the condition of the body work, and you have a look around the car. and you decide you're interested in paying, let's say, $5,000 for this car. So, you go and ring on the doorbell of the vendor and the door is answered in one situation by, for example, a female vicar. Okay? Could be Catholic. Well, they can't be Catholic, but you know, Episcopalian, doesn't really matter. Okay? Female vicar. And it's a tidy clean house. At that point, you probably upweight what you're prepared to pay by 20% or so. In in a parallel universe, the door so. In in a parallel universe, the door is answered by a guy in his underpants. In other words, someone with no shame. >> In that instance, you devalue the car, I suspect, by about $1,000 or more. In fact, you may not even buy it at all. And what we're doing here is we're effectively saying, what I'm going to do is a standin for the question, do I buy the car, which I don't have the technical knowledge to answer. I'm going to ask a supplementary heruristic question which is do I trust the person who's selling the car to me? >> And it's an interesting question. You my mother didn't know anything about cars, knew a lot about people. I think she would very reliably go around buying cars just through her assessment of the seller. And similarly, I think she might do better than someone with an engineering qualification who ignored who the seller was and their personality and character. Now, as a bit of evidence of this, I discovered because I've been investigating this, uh, various real estate agents have said to me that every estate agent does their utmost to make sure that until things are signed and sealed, the vendor never meets the buyer and vice versa. And the reason for that is if one of them doesn't like the other, they won't buy or sell. Now, when you think about it, that's completely unless the person's moving next door. Obviously, if you're buying a next door. Obviously, if you're buying a house from someone who's planning to move next door and they turn out to be a psycho, that's relevant information. But it seems to be the case that if you meet the the vendor and you basically don't trust them or think they're a bit shifty, it doesn't matter what the price is. It doesn't matter the condition of is. It doesn't matter the condition of the house. Suddenly, you revise your the house. Suddenly, you revise your valuation of the house downwards if you don't like the person selling it to you. And so that's one of the reasons why apparently uh real estate agents will leave any kind of contact between the two uh until after at least a survey has been done and enough commitments taken place. I once by the way I once didn't place. I once by the way I once didn't buy a house basically because the guy was being an about the fridge. Now the fridge was only worth uh you know I think 0.2% 2% uh of the value of the house or 0.02% of the value of the house. I can't quite remember. But because he was being a remember. But because he was being a dick about the fridge, I no longer trusted him about the house. >> Yeah. >> Weirdly, it turned out my instinct was right because then a friend of ours went to buy the same house. They got some separate land registry search done and found out that a chunk of the garden actually belonged to Network Rail, not to the house. It effectively filed a large part of the garden. So does that mean I just want to garden. So does that mean I just want to go back to the the real estate thing for a second. Does that mean a second. Does that mean pretty or attractive real estate agents would be more successful than >> It's a really interesting question which is I think we you know I think we ought to study these things much more because the assumption of an economist is that you need to disintermediate >> you don't need estate agents we just go on willow Zillow sorry or right move in the UK or whatever it is what's the Canadian equivalent >> I don't even know >> cababins.com or whatever okay.com Yeah, we go. Exactly. You go on one of those things. You choose the house you those things. You choose the house you want. You look at it. You then look at want. You look at it. You then look at the house, get a survey done, buy the house. We assume that there is, you house. We assume that there is, you know, this is a purely transactional exchange. Maybe in a rational world, that's exactly what it would be. >> But for one thing, actually, someone who's invested 15 years in doing up a house probably cares about what the person buying it is going to do to the house. So, my parents-in-law, for example, are fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into this. Seriously, get into something like this. Seriously, get into something like crack. >> We have no worry that I'm going to >> No worry you're going to become an enthusiastic. >> Can barely keep a plant alive. >> Good, good, good. Okay. Um, but I guarantee if you went and looked around their house and placed an offer while being an expert in botany and generally quoting people like Gertude Jel and, you know, prominent garden designers and Sissinghurst and Da uh you could you could buy their house for 200,000 less than if you turned up and said, "Brilliant, we can knock down that tree and put in a helipad." Yeah. >> You know, I think if you said, "We can knock down that tree and put in a carting track." Right. I don't think carting track." Right. I don't think they'd sell it to you at any price. >> If you're a founder, you know naming your startup takes forever.

Richard Thaylor did I think his most interesting work of all is actually on the concept of transaction utility which you may remember do you remember this >> a little bit >> yeah it's in I think it's in nudge and the famous thought experiment is this which I find fascinating and I think it's a really insightful thought experiment so the idea is you and your best friend are lying on a beach somewhere and it's hot and you're very thirsty and about quarter of a mile down the beach there's a place that sells ice cold beer And your friend says to you, and he asks people to imagine this, your friend says to you, "I'm off to blank to buy a beer. Tell me what the maximum amount you're happy to pay for a beer is. And if the price they quote falls is. And if the price they quote falls below that threshold, okay, I will buy the beer. And if not, I won't." And he the beer. And if not, I won't." And he asked people to imagine what the threshold would be of what they'd pay for a beer on a hot day when they were parched on a beach for a cold beer. the beer is going to be consumed back where they're sitting. So the ambiance or you know the the clientele of the establishment selling the beer is irrelevant because you're not going to consume it there. And the interesting thing is in one situation he says there is a boutique hotel selling chilled beer >> and in the other situation he says there's a shack selling cold beer >> and your price changes >> and your your your readiness to pay changes partly in accordance to what you imagine to be the overheads of the establishment selling the good. Even though the >> even though the the utility of the beer as distinct from the how good the transaction feels >> the actual utility of the cold beer is identical in both cases. I think that's a I think that's Richard Thaylor and I think it's extraordinarily interesting because I think we can make you car car salesmen will know this you know make the transaction feel good make them feel good when they drive out of the place that was uh segini right you you know people are more likely to buy from you if they like you they're more likely to uh like you if they trust you and you have something in common with them and and you can use all of these things to manipulate people unfortunately It's not manipulation. Be careful on that because No, no, no. We got to be really care. I think we got to be really careful here. One, one thing might be that a genuine cold-blooded psychopath would intentionally might find it difficult. This is a Jeffrey Miller theory that if you're on a first date, there's an element where apparently, it's a long time. I've been married for 30 something time. I've been married for 30 something years, but women on a first date will turn up a bit late or do something a little bit annoying. And Miller's theory is that it's a psychopath detection test. So that if you >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the worst things that can happen to women is to get into a relationship with someone who's, you know, psychopathic because you end up with an empty bank account and a, you know, and, you know, your sister's pregnant by her everything go, you know, everything goes hopelessly wrong. Someone who's written very wrong. Someone who's written very interestingly about this, by the way, is fabulous woman who writes about education and absolutely brilliant. I I'll remember her name in a second, but she's written quite about this having a psychopath in the family. Likewise, Kevin Dutton um has also written about this about his own father. There are certain things which you can do which make it very likely that psychopaths will out themselves. So the perfect test might be you bribe the waiter to tip soup on them. >> Oh, interesting. >> And they'll lose it. >> Or you turn up late and someone like assuming you're not a psycho because you're Canadian. So you know that's you're Canadian. So you know that's probably >> by default we're not >> relatively low. We're too polite. >> You're too polite. Exactly. Yes. It'd be too tiring to be a psychopath in Canada, wouldn't it? >> Soup on me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been sitting here. >> It's I shouldn't have been here. My fault. I got in the way of your soup. Uh the psychopath will lose lose his rag. >> Um uh and can't control this. And likewise, if you turn up late, there's a chance they'll go, "Look, I've been sitting on my own like an idiot for 15 minutes." Whereas you and I would go, minutes." Whereas you and I would go, "Oh, I know. I only just got here myself. The traffic's terrible." myself. The traffic's terrible." >> Yeah. We don't fully know, you see, the value of what is going on in using a personal quality as a proxy for a decision which is simply too complicated to legalize or to reduce to numbers. Also, it is I'll completely agree in economic terms, it's suboptimal, but if it leads to downside variance reduction, which is what we're really trying to do. We're not trying to optimize. We're trying to reduce the optimize. We're trying to reduce the risk of downsize. Yeah. Downside variance, you know, and that's true in all sorts of things, investment strategy, etc. You know, the barbell approach, you know, first of all, make sure you don't don't do anything disastrous. Then after that, try and get disastrous. Then after that, try and get lucky. >> You you say it like it's a conscious thing, but I think it's an unconscious because because if it is conscious, it's probably a reverse signal that you're actually a bit uh offkilter. if you're consciously doing that. >> In fairness, if if you study social science matters, you've probably but I agree with you that the I mean my wife occasionally gets a bit annoyed with me because I'll get you know I will literally apply TALB logic to decisions. Just to give an example, I always argue that over 36 years holidays where I've rented a car are better than holidays where I haven't. And my argument is you have more optionality. See? >> Oh, interesting. So if you've rented a car and you find the hotel's a bit meh or the hotel's not in a great area, you can just get in the car and go and find a beach somewhere else and go there every day. You know, in other words, you every day. You know, in other words, you know, so I deploy occasionally we'll deploy these kind of taleb lines and I, you know, I'll also say let's fly from so and so because you know it's the satisfices. You you're the one who I remember this you said you should always fly from the smallest airport that's convenient for you. Is that it? you. Is that it? >> Oh, I'm I'm a big small airport thing person. Okay. person. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's it's kind of interesting because airports are schizophrenic in a way because the clientele of an airport is roughly speaking a 50/50 mix between people who fly a hell of a lot and just want to get through the damn thing as quickly as they can. And people who only fly once a they can. And people who only fly once a year who regard the trip to the airport as part of the holiday and they love going through a shopping center and looking at Hermes outlets or whatever. And so airports are effectively catering for two totally disperate groups of traveler. >> And you can separate these people in the security line effectively. >> You can absolutely you can separate them. And that's why you know um in a them. And that's why you know um in a weird kind of way I think you notice sometimes that the queue for the priority lane in security is longer than the queue for the amateur lane. But frequent business travelers will still join the priority lane on the assumption that the people in front of them are more competent. I mean there's a George more competent. I mean there's a George Clooney up in the air gag about that right and so it is very interesting because is it is it irrational if it's a very reliable mechanism so all right one example would be I don't think it I don't think it works very well nowadays because there are enough posh spivs around but in the you know in the 19th century if you were a posh and respected real estate agent you had a lot of reputational skin in the game in the local community both commercially in people, you know, so you were highly vulnerable to reputational damage both commercially and also socially >> because you know a small town or a you know would have been to a large extent a prestige economy >> and therefore you know dealing with the posh local estate agent rather than some guy who claims to be cheap is not irrational. you know then that you know irrational. you know then that you know the commission may be higher whatever it may be but in terms of reputational skin in the game as insurance against being you know treated appallingly but and you know I think there's a kind of weird thing going on which is that uh you know the the job of the real estate agent is to some extent to be the person who stays behind in the place where the house is sold to suffer the reputational consequences of you know of anything outrageous because the vendor of the house isn't really reputationally vulnerable if they're moving 300 miles away. >> Mhm. >> And so, you know, some of the role of these intermediaries is just highly complicated. >> But when I say that, you know, we fundamentally seem to attach very very high waiting to, for example, a call center experience versus website design. I'm not suggesting for a second website design isn't really important. It's it's almost like there's some experiences that are sort of additive or subtractive and then there's some that are multiplicative >> like you can multiply by zero or you can multiply by 10 like a difference in that one particular factor. There's a there's a really interesting organization I can't remember what they're called online they call this a brand quake. >> A brand quake is where you do something. It could be resolving a problem really well. That would be a very good well. That would be a very good opportunity for a brandquake. The person has a problem. you put quite a lot of effort and intelligence into solving it very effectively for them. Um and then you ring them back to check that the problem has indeed been solved. Now that would be an example of something I'll give you the per okay I'll give you the perfect story of this. My father uh who is you know half Scottish and um without stereotyping anybody was quite parimonious with what he bought generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's genetic by the way. just culturally he was descended from long lines of Highland Scots who didn't get where they were today by you know splashing out and he had a I think three um when he died he had three or four Dyson devices which he'd bought from new in his home he had one on each floor to save from carrying them upstairs. Now these are by any them upstairs. Now these are by any objective measure pretty expensive vacuum cleaners. Mhm. vacuum cleaners. Mhm. >> One of the reasons he was so fanatically loyal was that Dyson, now interestingly, I'm going to make a point here, which is a privately owned company. >> Mhm. >> And that and do not do not underestimate the importance of this. PLC's or um uh or or companies on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange are incentivized to behave like psychopaths because they're optimized around short-term transactional value, not long-term relationship building. I think maybe the the generalization is that like if they're private companies led by a founder, then they're not run by the finance department. It's so interesting. I think about this a lot where you you have these short-term optimization and long-term effectiveness are two completely different. >> Short-term money off versus long-term value on. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so you can there's always somebody making more money than you, but you maybe they're cutting corners, maybe they're doing things that are unsustainable. And like you said, are unsustainable. And like you said, you can always save money in the short term, but do you damage your brand in life? >> By the way, my theory is the primary reason for the success of these private companies. It the secondary reason is companies. It the secondary reason is they look after their consumers better because they're effectively uh unwittingly their practitioners in the customer value movement, not the shareholder value movement. Well, Buffett had this saying where his directive, his letter I guess to all of his CEOs after he acquired the company was the only expectation I have for you is to treat this company as if you and your family have 100% of your money in it for 100 years and you can't take it out. >> Exactly that. Yeah. >> And and I think that that approach enables even in a public company that enables people to take long-term do the thing that's optimal. actually they do something they do something they look after their customers and there is an interesting exception to this probably which is for example Costco which and actually enterprise rental car is familyowned isn't it enterprise is familyowned >> in the and I've told everybody this in the IPA advertising effectiveness awards in the UK my argument is that with the exception of PNG Dagio unilver marketing le companies I don't think that plc's what do you call them in you know publicly traded I don't think they can actually do marketing very well >> because the requirement for short-term self-justification and numbers effectively overrides the real purpose of marketing which is investment in long-term customer value. >> I think this is why generalizing a little bit but this is why founders outperform even when they lead public corporations. They have the same corporations. They have the same pressures, the same analysts, the same but they also are considering posterity aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, it's interesting actually the German car industry, although their public companies are sort of familyrun. Aldi famously, which owns Trader Joe's, is basically owned by actually two German families. They had a huge feud, but some families. They had a huge feud, but some things going on there. One of the things they do is they look after their staff better. And I think when you look after better. And I think when you look after your staff better, the customer notices. >> Well, this is part of the Costco thing. So, I mean, >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the Saul Price line of thinking which when he started FedMart he sort of outlined the obligation of our business is we have a fidiciary relationship with a customer. Yeah. customer. Yeah. >> And Jim Sagal who founded Costco was a student of Saul Price and later on they would merge the companies. >> Of course they did, didn't they? Yes, you're absolutely right. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I think that's interesting right where you treat your employees better. Uh nice story from Dyson which better. Uh nice story from Dyson which is familyowned. In fact, I think is familyowned. In fact, I think familyrun companies, this would include people like um SC Johnson. I think they should wear a badge. Do you see what I mean? Just as you have a kite mark on mean? Just as you have a kite mark on British >> Well, Lob Laws is familyowned, isn't it? For example, in Canada, family, >> family control McCain family control. Mhm. >> So what I was saying about the advertising effectiveness awards, four out of the five gold winners, it's only every two years this award and it's very very rigorously judged. Four out of the five winners, namely McCain, your >> Canadian uh heroes. Um McCain, Yorkshire Tea, Specs Savers, and Laithweights, a wine company. Four out of the five wine company. Four out of the five winners, the fifth one was Guinness, which is sort of a family company in a sense, although it's owned by a Dio. And so my point is that I, you know, we should actually have a kite mark that allows consumers to prefer to buy from companies which aren't listed on some stock exchange somewhere and hence aren't controlled by the finance function because they're more trustworthy. >> That's an interesting I don't know if I agree with that, but u it's interesting to think. >> Well, is Rogers what's is Rogers still family controlled? I mean, Canada's family controlled? I mean, Canada's absolutely packed full of Canadian tier. What about that? Increasingly you get family controlled but not economically controlled. So you have like a dual controlled. So you have like a dual class. >> So the western family would control lob laws to some extent even though they're not majority shareholder. >> Well I think if you if you have a corporation that's hundreds of billions and you control 10 or 15% of it. You effectively have control over the company. >> Of course. Yeah. Ford Motor Company falls into that definition. I think the f you know the family or some there's a particular class of shares. >> A lot of dual class coming. But hold on, I want to go back to Dyson for a sec. What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? >> Actually, it's it's not advertising, it's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And uh in many cases, even marketing. And uh in many cases, even though I've worked in advertising for 36 years, I I I want to think of myself probably unsuccessfully, but I still aspire to be a marketer, okay? not an advertising person because advertising is a useful toolkit available to the marketer and by the way generally is pretty effective but Peter Ducker the purpose of business is to find and keep a customer profitably uh that's the purpose of marketing it's to you know to you know to either create or find uh customers with whom over time you can engage in mutually advantageous relationships to mutual profit that's it >> so what makes Dyson so good at marketing? >> Well, the story I heard from someone who worked at Dyson for 12 years is that he was sitting in a presentation, James Dyson presiding and they were presenting the call center sort of efficiency statistics. By the way, I'm absolutely fanatical about call centers because I'm terrified that in an AI age, people will try and effectively automate them. Uh I think what you should do instead is make them slightly smaller but a lot better >> because I don't think you can substitute for the human in cases of unusual problems, special circumstances, empathy generally. Don't get me wrong, I think generally. Don't get me wrong, I think you can get AI empathy. I'm not suggesting that AI is going to be completely unempathic, but at some point it's rather like the equivalent of I want to speak to the manager. There will be situations where you want to speak to a person who can understand your specific situation and has the power to intervene to override the normal rules and regulations to solve your problem because it is common sensical to do so. Even if you know our what service level agreement doesn't normally allow us to send out a replacement part. In this case, since your part is faulty, >> somebody who has the power to do the right thing Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I I think that will ultimately you'll have to have the human as the last port of call on that. Also your call center is the only way you can find out the problems that people can't solve anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? So there was a very smart person I met at Microsoft who when they uh when they took over some fairly niche Microsoft product they put the call center in the middle of the development team. I mean, I would argue that the call center of British Airways should be on the same floor as the boardroom because it's where you find out where you're going wrong with your existing customers who are the most important people. You know, people talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay because nobody does selling better than Shopify.

So often the businesses are run by the map which is like the spreadsheets, the volumes, the wait times, the whatever, but the territory is the customer calling in and the problem. >> That's cool, isn't it? >> The map is not the territory. >> Yeah. That they're experiencing. And so if you're not touching reality, you can get distorted by the map. But I want to go back. You've said by the way exactly go back. You've said by the way exactly the same thing Dan Davis did which is one huge advantage of being a customer value company not a shareholder value company is that customers live in the real world and therefore you are actually rooted in reality whereas shareholders by the way not share owners but the shareholders are principally interested in justifying their own existence to their investors and therefore they're dealing with a highly artificial construct in terms of defining the value of a customer But I think what's best for the shareholders is what's best for the customer. It's just the timeline mismatch that people have. So if your timeline for well it's have. So if your timeline for well it's incoherent by the way the shareholder value movement is totally incoherent because over what time frame which shareholder is what are you optimizing for? It's a completely incoherent for? It's a completely incoherent nonsense which is very very friendly to stock market analysts who want a ready supply of quarterly data so they can their way out of things. How valuable it is to people with pensions is a completely separate matter because one of the things it does is it prevents companies from innovating effectively and it prevents them from investing properly in customer relationships. >> Okay. Come back to Dyson. You were telling me this story. Somebody had worked there for 12 years. >> So they were going blah blah blah average call time blah blah blah average wait time and it was the standard kind of call center metrics about effectively how quickly can we get these people off the phone. I mean it's a bit more the phone. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that. You know, I'm sure there's some measure of satisfaction, but it was kind of evaluating the call center on an operational efficiency standpoint. And Dyson basically said, "Stop right now. You've got this all wrong. The way we should look at this is we should treat it as an honor if one of our customers chooses to get in touch with us, and we should therefore respond to them accordingly, as if we're flattered by the contact, not as if we're bothered by the interruption or words to that effect. I'm I'm putting words in his effect. I'm I'm putting words in his mouth, but this is roughly speaking what the person said happened in the meeting. >> That makes a lot of sense. I mean, >> and by the way, that's why my father had four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I hope he won't mind me saying this, my late father. But every time he rang them late father. But every time he rang them up, which might have been only once every year. >> Yeah. >> They did something astonishing and they were really, really helpful and they solved the problem and the part arrived the next day. Sometimes they didn't even charge for the replacement part and therefore he completely trusted those people and therefore was willing to pay an enormous premium really over other vacuum cleaners which might have had the same notional you know effectiveness precisely because of that trust. There's so much opportunity here, right? If you think of you competing in a world where we're moving to AIdriven call centers, uh if I took the exact opposite approach, which is by the way, you should do both. >> A really, really good service organization allows for very streamlined efficient service for people who know exactly what they want and extremely emp empathetic service for people who are undecided, uncertain or find themselves in an unusual situation. And so you need to do both. And that's that's where I think the tech bros have got it all wrong because they see the opportunity of tech as being a one-way street towards ever greater efficiency, streamlining. And let's face it, tech streamlining. And let's face it, tech bros are not neurotypical in terms of what they want from things. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-making along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy, you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> You're using tech crows as like a >> No, no, no, no. It's perfectly reasonable to say that the people who work in this field and not representative of the whole human population. That's a reasonable population. That's a reasonable assertion. >> What is it you're representing when you say tech bro though? Um, anybody in a tech industry, just as anybody in advertising, myself included, is overweighted towards a belief in the ability of advertising to solve all problems. And I will truly admit that I am guilty as charged. Um, however, ad people don't get that much opportunity to convince other people of the rightness of their argument. What has happened is that in marketing for example the tech companies the consulting firms that sell stacks and I owe a lot of this to a guy called Adel Bori very interesting self-taught Libyan marketing writer former boxer Annel Bori and I coined the phrase technopplasmosis by analogy with toxopplasmosis which is tech people and consultants have taken over the finance department >> so that the marketing metrics the finance department has faith in and demands from marketing are not those metrics which are most conducive to building brand and customer value over time. They're the metrics which are most time. They're the metrics which are most conducive to selling tech solutions to the companies. >> What are the metrics that are most >> well it's all about short-term transactional uh bottom of the funnel um clickth through you know how can you shovel money to meta in a slightly more efficient way. It's not about long-term efficient way. It's not about long-term value creation at all right now. Now, don't get me wrong. All that bottom of the funnel short-term transactional stuff is very important to get right. I'm not I'm not disparaging it, but it's only a third of the game, >> right? >> And they're not interested in the other two/irds of the game because they don't make money if someone spends money on their call center or, you know, upgrades their call center staff or allows the call center staff to call out. >> It's sort of like cyber security. It's seen as a cost. It's a cost. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bonnie Blue would do really well in this because she's all about the numbers, not about the quality of the relationship. You know, funny enough, she did work in NHS finance procurement. Ironically, or no, finance recruitment actually. She recruited people for N for National Health Service finance. So, her approach to sex is merely an extrapolation of what she learned, I think, recruiting finance people for the National Health Service. All all about the quantity, not Service. All all about the quantity, not about the value creation, the the relationship. I like this quantification relationship. I like this quantification bias thinking I mean Buffett okay you're quite rightly your hero um is he was obsessed with the quality of the management of companies with whom he invested wasn't he >> well I mean I'm obsessed with personal factors I've read a lot in I think I'm going to give a nuanced answer here I don't know the answer so I'll preface that with that I did read a lot about what he used to do in the 60s and he used to hire like private investigators And what he was trying to determine, I don't think it was anything about the person other than does what they say line up with who they are. >> And if the answer's yes, I can deal with that because I know what to expect. And if the answer's no, if they're they can't go to work and, you know, claim to be a penny pincher, because if they go to work and say they're going to cut costs, but they're driving around with a Ferrari or whatever, like this is a thing that it doesn't line up. And so I I feel like he was always just trying to assess the predictability of people if that makes sense. >> In other words, by looking at their consistency >> consistency did the management >> do what they said they were going to do. the balance sheet changes over you know like he was a very he had a different emphasis on things than people I think realize and I think with a lot of his investments I mean my personal take is he was looking for predictability and it wasn't about massive disruption it was never about things being turned around he got out of that in the late60s with diversified refilling was the last real turnaround situation they sort of got themselves into they exited quickly and when They got burned. Did they quite Well, they didn't really get burned, but I was talking to Munger about this over dinner one day and he's like, "We just realized that we made a mistake. Uh, we were never going to make a lot of money in this business and it was highly competitive and we had no edge and so they got out as quickly as they could." Uh, and I think that the predictability of what he buys, at least his long-term holdings, like if you look at that, I think it's really interesting because it's like you can kind of see it. The railroad, people are going to be using the railroad in 50 years. That's a great example. So, it will be unbelievably example. So, it will be unbelievably difficult to build a competing one, >> but you can also you can leverage it if it's predictable. And leverage is is it's predictable. And leverage is is this interesting thing where he says they don't do a lot. And they don't when you look at the whole company, but on the railroad, for instance, they'll a decent amount of debt in the railroad because they know what the earnings it's very predictable the same as the energy where they're putting a lot of capital they put a lot of debt in and I talked to this guy in um Nova Scotia John Bragg and he sort of did the same thing and so he c he created Oxford frozen foods he's this incredible story he's this billionaire from this small town of 1100 people he started >> I've been to Nova Scotia what's it called Oxford Nova >> it's called Oxford Nova Scotia and started not one, not two, but three multi-billion dollar companies from this small town of,00 people. >> Is he still there? >> He's still there. Yeah. They're like that. >> Such a great guy, too. And it was fascinating to talk to him because he basically was like, "Look, you know, he owns North America's largest private telecommunications company." And he telecommunications company." And he said, "I wasn't afraid of debt at all." No. >> And we levered up massively. We went all in multiple times acquiring more assets, acquiring, >> but if there's something more volatile, he gets very nervous about the debt. >> So, he wouldn't do it if there was volatility. But he also had this thing volatility. But he also had this thing where it was so counterintuitive to what you hear on Wall Street, which is is like, I don't mind paying more, you know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, and I was like, really, that surprises me. And he's like, well, a lot of these me. And he's like, well, a lot of these things only come up once. I don't get another shot at it. And if I'm a private company, I don't have public company shareholders, uh, and it takes me, you know, 5 years versus 3 years to get my money back out of the deal, why do I care? I'm never going to be offered this care? I'm never going to be offered this again, and they're not going to build another one. >> No. >> So, when it comes to fiber optic in the ground, he's like, it's getting harder and harder to do. >> What is this company, the Canadian company in telecoms? >> Uh, it's East Link Cable Communications. >> I've heard that. Yeah. And so, but they not only do they deliver cable to a large portion of Canada, but they own a lot of infrastructure that people aren't aware of. And he's like, well, what aware of. And he's like, well, what difference does it make? And I've been chewing on that nugget ever since. And you know, you can apply this from a marketing perspective as well, right? If you if you have a client or go back to real estate for a sec. I have a client who's looking at a lakehouse or a cabin or a cottage or whatever you call them in in the UK or in the United States and you get a property and you say my budget is I don't know say 500,000 and you find a property that's seven and is it worth splurging on the $700,000 property or whatever it is and the answer is is this like a once in a generation property that I'm never going to have the shot at again and if you can frame frame things >> is also much more likely to be scarce >> the rarer you get generally >> and then overpaying you make overpaying seem rational and in a way it kind of is rational where it's like well this is only going to come up once so like I I have a friend actually going through this now they're looking at buying a family cottage and I'm like how do you think about these things he's like I saw this one it was perfect but it was a little more money than I brought this up having a cottage on a lake on which yours is the only cottage is the kind of gold standard for Canadian property. >> That would be the dream. Have a lot of lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as a kind of >> but it's sort of like what what do you want? If you want a second property, you want? If you want a second property, you want proximity so it's easy to get to. You want privacy. Uh so there's not a lot of things around it. And these things just don't come up very often as many lakes as we have. I mean the the prime properties come up maybe once every five or six years per lake. And >> and as Kaden said, in the long term, we're all dead. >> And we're all dead. So anyway, an interesting aside here, but when we sat down, we were talking about high trust versus low trust societies and introducing friction. Yeah. I'm introducing friction. Yeah. I'm wondering, spend a beat on that for a second. >> Well, I met um someone you must interview, by the way, called Philip K. Howard, who's written various books called Life Without Lawyers. He's just written a book which is coming out right now called um uh I think it's uh can do which is restoring the spirit of American can do and he argues that a large part of economic decline and social malaise has come from the overintrusion of law and regulation into practices which should properly be left to subjective human judgment. that we've created a culture where people are so afraid of making a subjective decision that they fall back on often totally inappropriate rules and regulations. And there are a whole bunch of people who are employed not always by the government just as much by the private sector who are much more interested in adherence to uh approved procedure than they are in quality of outcome. >> Because you can't get fired for >> you can't get fired for following the rules. >> You can't get me in trouble. Well, you told me to follow this proced and common sense would be to opt out at some point in certain situations and use your brain and judgment and uh but if I do that if I have if I do very little parapet there's no upside uh and there's considerable uh reputational risk and and career risk >> from doing something slightly perverse and different. But there are a whole and different. But there are a whole bunch of arguments. First of all, an awful lot of quality human decision-making of necessity has to be tacit and instinctive, not regulatory. There are various people I think it might be Michael Palani who says most of life is like a kaleidoscope. We never completely encounter the same situation twice. Mhm. twice. Mhm. >> And therefore regulating for the universal when in fact the great evolutionary gift of the human brain is adapting to context is inherently lawyers love it of course because they make money out of this. You know, arguably uh the legal system, particularly in the United States, has strayed into all kinds of areas which were once settled by two humans amicably discussing something and possibly finding a creative resolution to to the trade-off that's replaced by effectively we will take this to a legal decision and that starts to infect um particularly because there's no tor law reform in the US and that's partly Because I was told yesterday trial lawyers are among the largest donors to the Democratic Party because they resist any kind of tort law reform. M >> this has led to things that should be solved through our evolved human talent for conflict resolution being solved through totally inappropriate application of of uh legal structures to a situation which is uh in many cases not really adequately captured by law or where a legal decision is made which makes perfect sense within one setting but which sets a precedent which leads to ludicrous second order consequences. Yeah. So for example, if you accept the fact that a I think has happened in one of uh Philip K. Howard's cases, someone demanded that trees were dropped down in their street because one of their grandchildren was allergic to the nut that came off the tree. The argument would be that if you accept that, which may seem kind-hearted and uh you know and and generous within that particular frame of reference, ultimately you've opened up the path to widespread deforestation because nobody can grow a tree anywhere to which anybody could claim to be allergic. There's an interesting case um allergic. There's an interesting case um in England where someone broke into a theme park or some park of some kind and then while drunk dove into a pond which wasn't really deep and hurt themselves and then sued in the lower courts they said there should have been a notice warning of the shallow water because you could reasonably anticipate this problem and then it went up to the high whatever whoever it was the lawlords at the time and they said if you took if you took this ruling to its uh uh you know natural consequences you would have no lakes you know you would have no swimming you would have no swings you'd have no playgrounds because everything would have to be ge around with warnings about every possible anticipated negative consequence that could arise from this part of the environment and so what what happens is that uh you've created a kind of idea I suppose where the legal solution has become the default >> uh when it should in fact be the last resort. >> What happened to common sense? >> Well, this is this is the argument being that that your fellow countrymen, what's his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston Saul. Have you come across him? Saul. Have you come across him? >> No. >> You Canadians totally underrate yourselves. You know, you produce yourselves. You know, you produce wonderful people and you're always trying to import people like me from the UK or people from the US. John Rolston saw wrote this book which I think is called Voltater's Bastards >> and he argues that human brains have evolved with a variety of mental capabilities only one of which is the capacity for reason. >> There's also the capacity for imagination, creativity, common sense, you know, etc. We have a whole variety of different mental mechanisms at our disposal gifted to us by, you know, a few million years of evolution as a social species. And yet we've made social species. And yet we've made rationality the gold standard. This is what's weird about working in advertising, by the way. And I think it's probably similar way. And I think it's probably similar to theoretical physics and it's probably similar to entrepreneurialism. Okay, which is what's unusual about those fields is that rationality is the bronze standard >> in advertising. If someone says, you know, uh this is the problem and you come up with a completely rational solution, um people don't go, right, that's perfect. let's go and do it as that's perfect. let's go and do it as they would do in a finance setting or a compliance setting. Okay? In most of compliance setting. Okay? In most of decision- making in institutions, rationality, i.e. quality of rationality, i.e. quality of argumentation is the gold standard. In advertising, if you came up with a rational ad, people go, "Yeah, it's all right, but can you do a bit better?" You know, is there an ad that says the same thing, but in a more emotionally engaging way? Is there an ad that says engaging way? Is there an ad that says the same thing in a way that's funny? Is there an ad that says this in a way people will remember or will act on? So what is funny about being an advertising creative and you know I spent 20 years of my life either in or managing those departments is you know the rational solution is where you start >> you use it as a springboard to something better. There's a famous quote, you better. There's a famous quote, you know, fascinatingly from Neil Spore who said, "You're not thinking, you are merely being logical." Isn't it? I think you'll know that >> he was an interesting guy, wasn't he? In terms of his because he also was the person who said the opposite of a good idea, you know, in boring physics, the opposite of a good idea is wrong, but in high level physics, the opposite of a good idea might be another good idea. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What can we learn from marketing from the madmen era that's still true today? Uh today? Uh >> I think there was an understanding then and the remuneration of agencies respected this because you were paid on commission. So if you had a big idea and commission. So if you had a big idea and you came up with a campaign and the client spent millions running the campaign, you made money from that campaign for years after you'd conceived it. So it was rather like having it. So it was rather like having royalties on a book. >> Oh, okay. >> We didn't realize that at the time. Then media independence came along and so we had to be paid by the hour like lawyers and management consultants and we've never recovered because it's a catastrophic way to be paid and the reason it's a catastrophic way to be paid my argument is that marketing is actually fat tailed so is innovation R&D pharmaceutical research science okay in other words 5 to 10% of what you do delivers perhaps 110% of the value and therefore paying people by the power and demanding that every quantum of effort has to be matched to a quantum of value creation in some neat proportion. This is so the way market never mind advertising that okay right let's look at the whole of marketing as a discipline within an organization of which advertising is not a not necessarily very important part you know for a lot of organizations it may be you know relatively trivial what they actually spend on bought communication on the other hand uh you know how you design your reception or you know whatever you know that's still affected the application of psychology to value creation let's say you have a brilliant idea and the value of that idea last goes on for 10 years. And I've seen this happen all the time. The agency, let's say an agency had the idea. It may well have been the client who had that idea. They are held responsible for every single unit of cost they incur >> year by year by year by year. You cannot offset any of those costs against the value you created in 2023 by having a huge idea. Let me give you an example. huge idea. Let me give you an example. There's an enormous idea for a very large enormous American, let's say, fastmoving consumer goods company. There's an idea conceived by Oglev Australia. It has made that company in Australia. It has made that company in excess of a billion dollars in the last 10 years. It's still running. It runs in 10 years. It's still running. It runs in something like a hundred markets. Still useful today. For that idea, the agency in Australia got paid $350,000 Australian dollars. Or rather, that's Australian dollars. Or rather, that's what they made from it. So in other words, you have a billion dollar idea, you get to buy a small flat in a crap part of Sydney. Now what I'm saying is that this is not me bleing about the advertising industry. It's saying that advertising industry. It's saying that anything like R&D or marketing which is fat tailed, in other words, a small percentage of what you do, it's Jeff Bezos's point about in business, you know, in baseball you can only score four, in business you can score a thousand. In marketing thousand. In marketing when you score a thousand which and the purpose half the purpose of marketing is not operational gradual incremental improvement it's finding another way to hit the ball out of the park and score 100. If you cannot claim the credit for 100. If you cannot claim the credit for that except to the extent that it delivers value in the quarter in which you had the idea or the financial year in which you had the idea you are underfunding your marketing effort. So, it's like saying to imagine if you went to JK Rowling and said, "Yep, you can have the royalties on the Harry Potter books, but only on the first edition." And consequently, long-term marketing ideas when you're paid by the hour or when you're evaluated by the quarter as marketers would be. Now, you wouldn't go into a pharmaceutical research company and said, "You invent a blockbuster drug this week." No. Or you're all fired. You this week." No. Or you're all fired. You accept the fact that you spend a load of money effectively. Okay, this is the money effectively. Okay, this is the brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't find entrepreneurs in chess clubs. You find entrepreneurs in casinos. They're playing poker. They're playing bat gam. You know, they're playing games of chance with an occasional very high payoff. And a lot of life is exactly payoff. And a lot of life is exactly like that, but you don't know where the huge payoff's going to come in advance. The people who are running these organizations for the benefit of financial predictability are trying to make it chess. They're trying to turn it into a reductionist game where the most you can score is one for a win. >> They're trying to put a ceiling on. >> They're trying effectively to to to pretend it's a high variance mechanis low sorry a low variance mechanistic predictable process. >> 50 50% of your effort in life once you've ensured the fact that you're not going to starve to death, die, etc. You know, you've looked after your children should be attempts to get lucky. In other words, what Nim would say, I love this phrase, uh, increasing your surface area exposure to posit to positive upside optionality. You know, finding upside optionality. You know, finding opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I want to go back to this. I want to think about this out loud here. And maybe I'm wrong. With a book, it's great. I write wrong. With a book, it's great. I write a book once, I can sell it for the next hundred years, assuming I've earned it on my road. >> Yeah. If you have a great marketing idea which continues to add value for the next 15 years, the difference some of that credit should be offset against your current marketing costs. Fair. The difference is marketing also can go the other way and and like Jaguar perhaps or Cracker Barrel, I don't know if you followed the So you can create negative value. It's not like the baseline is value. It's not like the baseline is zero and there's only upside and the upside is like one to 1 million. You can actually destroy a company through marketing. >> The case is okay. >> And advertising. >> Uh some of those I'm going to defend the companies. >> Oh, please do. Yeah. Yeah. >> Because in the case of Bud Light, >> are you defending Bud Light? I want to hear this. >> Yeah. No, no, no. They could not have necessarily anticipated that because it was confected outrage. Look, I'm politically on the right. Okay. I get just as angry from confected outrage on the on the right, which is, "Oh, they've gone woke when, you know, you're merely showing, you know, a mix of ethnic groups you're advertising or something. This is bull, right?" And and the right do it and the right?" And and the right do it and the left do it. Uh there's confected outrage on the left, I would argue, about um American Eagle, and it's confected outrage on the right. It's done for signaling purposes by a very narrow group of people. Do those cases actually damage the business? I don't know the figures. Gillette did. There was an figures. Gillette did. There was an extremely Now, this wasn't confected outrage because Gillette ran an advertisement. They realized they had to advertisement. They realized they had to move on perhaps from the best a man can get despite the fact obviously that their customer base is overwhelmingly male for fairly obvious reasons. And they produced an ad which I would argue and even my wife would argue was needlessly um insulting towards men in that it conflated the me too movement with barbecuing. Okay. In other words, it seemed to take a definition of toxic masculinity which went which went the whole spectrum from things which all rightinking men would quite rightly condemn to things which for example two boys having a you know a small scrap on a patch of grass which all primates play fight. It's not, you know, don't get me wrong, sorry. If, you know, there's a kid wailing on another kid with a plank of wood, uh, you know, I'll be quick to condemn it, but I'm not totally, you know, the odd play fighting thing, barbecuing, I don't think is particularly objectionable. And that was particularly objectionable. And that was a case where it was almost a kind of act of deliberate affronttery to your core target audience. The Bud Light thing, to target audience. The Bud Light thing, to put it in context, was a influencer marketing campaign of which most people in the company were probably unaware where they sent personalized caners of Bud Light to a variety of different uh influencers, one of whom was Dylan Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess about this as a Brit, you're Canadian. >> Mhm. >> The gender thing isn't quite the flash point in the UK or Canada as it is in the United States. Did you know for example um that when it came out I found this quite interesting in Britain we've had pantomime for 200 years you know men dressing up as women you know women dressing up as attractive women dressing up as young boys Shakespeare you know crossdressing some like it hot was a highly controversial film with all the studios in the United States when it came out because it involved men dressing up as women now in the UK my grandmother went to see it she was a sort of conservative woman in a Welsh provincial It would not have occurred to her literally that there was anything controversial about this at all. It was simply funny. >> I think what maybe has changed is the meaning we ascribed to it. >> Well, in this case, my argument was okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan Mulvaney the face of Bud Light, >> right? >> You know, and I think creating these cultural flash points through confected outrage is something to be disparaged when the rights do it and when the left do it. I don't I I think it's equally I do it. I don't I I think it's equally I think it's equally absurd because you have in any communication you have to understand context and the intention of the person producing the communication. Now in the case of Jaguar they wanted it to look unlike a I would argue I mean I was talking to Rick Rubin who was in Hawaii and he'd heard about the Jaguar ad the it wasn't an ad by the way. Do you know that don't you? It way. Do you know that don't you? It never ran as an advertisement. It was a brand film they showed at the launch of the car. And then I had a right-wing the car. And then I had a right-wing podcast uh in the UK going, you know, it utters the most out, you know, um outrageous anti-conservative sentiment, which is copy nothing. Copy nothing was the exhortation of Sir William Lions who founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he said it in 1932. He was the original founder of the car company. You've also got to understand their position. What are they trying to do? So, so I'm just explaining this just in wider in wider context, which is >> they fundamentally made a mistake. I can't blame them for doing it because we all do this. We all benchmark against our most obvious competitor. >> Don't benchmark against your most obvious competitor. All you'll do is obvious competitor. All you'll do is make make yourself a copy of them. And Jaguar was always trying to compete head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Mhm. Audi. Mhm. >> And bluntly put, because of the scale of those entities, it was always going to lose. Because if you're the kind of lose. Because if you're the kind of person who's happy to buy a BMW, an Audi, or a Mercedes, and you're also happy to buy a Jaguar, you'll probably end up buying an Audi, a Mercedes, or a BMW simply to, you know, because of scale, winner takes all effects, all manner of other things. So, if Jaguar needs to survive in the electric car age, making its cars in the UK, which as a Jaguar lover, I ideally want them to continue to do, they've got to find a different kind of target audience rather than benchmarking themselves against uh, you know, companies which have gains to scale and a whole load of advantages they can't replicate. And so going for what you might call the car of choice of the wealthy younger creative class. Reasonable bet. >> It's a reasonable bet. Okay. I work in advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car lover. I really really like for example lover. I really really like for example the Chris Bangal era BMWs I thought were magnificent. I really really like those magnificent. I really really like those because can't buy one. And the reason is because part of my shtick, okay, is being a bit left field. And if I drive around in an Audi, it kind of screams I work in financial services, >> right? >> Okay. You know, I aspire to managerial roles. Do you see what I mean? roles. Do you see what I mean? >> Yeah. >> And so, you know, I've always bought slightly weird cars there. I don't know. I've been fed to there. I don't know. I've been fed to know what you have. What What do you have back in Canada? I got to ask. >> Uh, I have a Tesla. >> Oh, fine. You see that? You know, did you do you have a sticker on it that says I bought this before Elon went mad or anything like that so that Canadians don't key your car? It's >> been keyed three times. >> It's been keyed by and uh run into by uh somebody I can only assume intentionally uh in the past. >> Ota. >> Oh yeah. In the past. >> Well, Otawa is this like hot bed of Elon haters. Is it? haters. Is it? >> It's interesting because my mom got me one of those stickers and I I was like, I don't have a problem with Elon. like I don't I don't understand this. I'm not going to put that on my car. And you I want to relate this to sort of evolution. >> I agree. It's a little like um biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it? >> Well, it's also like going back to the Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things together, right? And I think we need together, right? And I think we need >> a variation in approaches. And the the point of this is like we need more people like Elon, not fewer in the world. Whether you agree with him or world. Whether you agree with him or not, this is how society progresses. We need differences. We have an environment and people thrive or don't thrive in that environment. Ideally, we have some that environment. Ideally, we have some sort of social safety net uh to catch people um if they don't succeed. >> But not ideally, that's essentially in any civilized society. >> And and so Jaguar the same thing. They're they're taking a bat as a company. They're being different. They company. They're being different. They occupy an environment and manage. >> If you think about it, they survive as Land Rover, Range Rover because they have effectively created the category they dominate, >> right? So I want more variety. >> right? So I want more variety. >> No. Oh right. This is this is where your wonderful compatriate Rodri Martin, praise be upon him, okay, makes this point that um economists have this fantasy of the world of companies in direct competition driving down price and increasing efficiency while supplying the same thing which is based on a false premise that people know what they want to begin with. Now I would argue when you don't create differentiation, everybody suffers. Now let me explain everybody suffers. Now let me explain because if you have a differentiated car market, it makes the car market more valuable overall to investors because uh you know there is more variety within the market. It benefits the companies the market. It benefits the companies because they can achieve a reasonable profit on what they do because it has some degree of scarcity or uniqueness and it benefits the consumer because the consumer ends up with more choice. What often happens is you have something like a regulated telecoms market or you have a regulated insurance market and everybody is forced to compete along the same dimension and what you end up with is just red red ocean competition and nobody wins. >> But where I was going with all of this is that going back to the Madman era and how you can create a billion dollar uh profit for the company and only get paid like 300k. >> You need to watch that. Yeah. And I think I've never actually watched MMA, but I think the the point that I was getting at is you can also create negative value and like how do you ascribe for the negative value? >> I can speak for Gillette where the evidence was that it was and by the way the research showed it was deeply problematic with a large swave of people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I doubt it. In some ways you could argue it's an ingenious marketing strategy which is that you press the hot buttons of 1% of the population. So they then repeat your message accompanied by their own signaling outrage. Meanwhile, you get free media coverage practically everywhere. >> But maybe I'm naive. >> I mean, the media budget for that Jaguar film you realize was zero. >> Maybe I'm naive. Like the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle thing, I think we're just going back to normal, aren't we? and like we've we've sort of deviated in the last few years and and that seems more maybe it's akin to my time and my frame and like when I was brought up, but like nothing about that struck me as rage or um on either side. Like when I looked at that, I was like, "Oh, great." It's just like an advertisement. It's a pup. >> Yeah. Like it just I didn't even think more I didn't think there was more to it. I just saw, oh, this is great. it. I just saw, oh, this is great. Right. There there's a kind of weird sensitivity signaling which generally has nothing to do with the groups you are trying to protect which is just it's sometimes called a purity spiral where you effectively signal your moral or political purity by signaling extraordinary heightened sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend someone else. even if the group on whose someone else. even if the group on whose behalf you claim to be campaigning is completely unconcerned by it. >> But like the opposite of her, whatever that would be, it would not cause rage in me either. It would just I wouldn't I wouldn't even think about the brand, you know? It would just be like another know? It would just be like another thing that flies by. I don't understand why we're so hair triggered at that this moment in time unlike maybe never before. way you have to really watch it before. way you have to really watch it in um and I've I've noticed this in certain people on the right which is I think it's fundamentally dangerous to invest too much of your own identity in a political standpoint to the point where I I've seen it in people both sides become effectively deranged. Now, you could say that's deranged. Now, you could say that's that's the effect of the people who attack them and that uh the derangement wouldn't happen and wouldn't be necessary in a different kind of media environment. What's different about environment. What's different about today? Why is everybody on such a hair today? Why is everybody on such a hair trigger? Why do we identify so strongly trigger? Why do we identify so strongly with extremes? I'm going to say actually with extremes? I'm going to say actually that everybody always blames social media. I would argue that the mainstream media, it is always in your interest, and this is a problem in journalism. It's always in your interest to provoke a fight because then you have something to cover. Nobody's interested in reading cover. Nobody's interested in reading about peace and harmony. They're interested in reading about discord and argument and dispute. By the way, that's an evolutionary tendency. If we're sitting here and we hear we heard a fight break out across the street, we'd be there with our noses pressed up against the glass. Okay? If if we heard, you know, people amicably discussing the weather, we wouldn't pay it the slightest attention. you know, where slightest attention. you know, where where we we've fundamentally evolved to pay attention to uh conflict >> and so the only difference is the tools available to us >> and the extent to which social media provide the mainstream media with the tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to find someone who was outraged by the the Sydney Sweeney advertisement, you'd actually have to do some leg work, wouldn't you? I don't think you now now wouldn't you? I don't think you now now it's one search on X or uh you know blue sky or whatever it may be. Uh willful misunderstanding is another thing that you know is another technique which is deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean I you know it's perfectly obvious that that had is not intended to mean Sydney Sweeney is the flower of Aryan womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's not that. Now in a perfect world had not that. Now in a perfect world had they had more budget maybe they would have had three celebrities of different different ethnicities or genders or whatever it may be um but nonetheless this business where you effectively effect to be outraged by things well I'll give you a lovely story about this I always forget which is I don't think phrases like uncomfortable or offended or inappropriate you know you know you that you get these things where you know your presence here people would find it you know would feel unsafe triggering okay they don't really belong in the public sphere >> you know they're matters which for you know a few hundred thousand years we simply sorted out amongst ourselves we didn't have we didn't make recourse to the university dean or the supreme court in cases where we were bothered by things because you accepted that's just part of life and we were allowed then creatively to find ways to get along without recourse to some sort of speurious rule book. Consequently, you know, I don't I don't think those phrases like in I mean, this is one of the worst things that happens. You say, you know, was accused someone is described in the newspaper as being accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I now have no idea. I mean, I've literally had to book people for speaking engagements. You go on their speaking engagements. You go on their Wikipedia page and it says accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no idea whether they're the next Epstein, right? or whether they told a knockk right? or whether they told a knockk knockock joke that two people found unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? Knock knock. At least I'm not being complet because otherwise I could have been misunderstood there. You see, but you I I now have no idea. Literally no idea whether the person's guilty of some utterly trivial infraction which would only have offended 0.01% of the population >> or they're not guilty at all. somebody just made up an accusation and the accusation became the framing and the framing became the narrative. >> So it strikes me as highly problematic in the UK. I'm not one of these people, by the way. I'm not, you know, I'm not JD Vance. I don't believe that free JD Vance. I don't believe that free speech is completely dead in the UK. But there are worrying signs where people who make a complaint on the basis that they found something disturbing can then call in the that's not a police matter unless it involves a direct threat of physical action. >> Yeah. I mean simply being disqued by something can't be. >> But we we've gotten to this point and you know to varying degrees in varying different countries where you know the we don't tolerate people who have different ideas than us and we saw this last week play out in the US with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And so whether you agree or disagree with him and his views, >> I have to confess I was only dimly aware of his existence beforehand perhaps because I'm a Brit. Uh I mean I I I'd heard the name and I knew he >> we see the same thing in Canada with sort of our politics, right? I imagine you see in the US too where media is definitely uh intolerable of one position and more favorable of the other. You can analyze this. You can study it. You could do a PhD on this. It exists. And it seems like we're just not capable of having to think for ourselves. And we're not capable of having reason discussion on things and and being friends with people. It used to be back in the the 30s, the 40s, the the Churchill era, both sides of the the house or would talk to each other. They would have dinner together. They would find common ground. How many of these people who are hypers sensitized on one side or the other, how many of them really exist? By the way, don't include really exist? By the way, don't include things like one of the things I find really disturbing is the practice of the media describing people who say oppose uncontrolled immigration and describe them as a far-right group. >> Oh, and well, because that is that you know you normal people are described as far right now. So, so in other words, if if you literally take an opinion which may may be held, by the way, from my own personal standpoint, I'm pretty benignely disposed to immigration uh within reason. However, I also believe within reason. However, I also believe in democracy and if a significant proportion of the population disagrees with me, I owe it to them to hear them out because their circumstances are different to my own. You know, I might be beneficially, you know, one of the slightly annoying things is people who are very rich people who are pro- immigration because they say their Polish housekeeper is wonderful. Well, that is an experience of immigration which is not shared perhaps by any means by the other 98% of people. I'm conscious of the fact that depending on where you are, you see the world differently. That's inevitable. And the differently. That's inevitable. And the job of a democracy is to accept uh the majority opinion even when it goes against your own. And so describing and vilifying an opinion which is held by a fairly large weight of the population regardless by the way the rights and wrongs of the whole thing. I'm not even getting into this now. Um it's deeply dangerous because people go well if that makes me far right it looks like I'm far right. I mean, insulting, calling people right. I mean, insulting, calling people deplorables is a terrible, terrible way of getting deplorables to gang up against you and then people don't speak up. They tell their opinions and then up. They tell their opinions and then you lose debate and you lose and then you lose perspective because you don't hear the other side of it. So, you think there is no other side and anybody who believes that might be an idiot like >> give an example on this debate which changed my mind a bit. a very very good Oxford economist called Paul Collier wrote this economically balanced assessment of general migration and made some you know pointed out that on both sides of what you might call the balance sheet it was immeasurably more complicated for example if Nigeria trains doctors who then immediately hoof it to the United States how how is that possibly a good thing overall in that a poor country trains doctors who move to a rich country which arguably has enough doctors from a country which doesn't have enough. That's not you know you have to >> depends on how you frame it right because another way to look at that and I'm not arguing for this by any stretch is that they come here they make a lot of money and they send that money home to their families. >> I agree all Collier said is look this is inordinately more complicated. >> Yeah. Um it is >> one of the things he said is the right for example of recent immigrants to family reunification is a bit dubious because you're giving someone a right which the native population do not have. So I can't pick five Canadians and get them British citizenship. You see >> I I've yet to meet somebody who totally disagrees with all immigration. It's a matter of what reasonable immigration looks like >> and also assimilation. It should be decided by someone other than human rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. >> I would probably agree because you know fundamentally as a as a branch of the law that is not a partial >> entity because human rights lawyers it isn't you you know that great phrase of is it Sinclair Lewis or someone which is uh it is difficult to get someone to disbelieve something when their salary is dependent on believing it. And just as management consultants have a huge incentive to sell in digital transformation programs to their clients and therefore we have a culture in business which more or less doesn't assumes that any money spent on tech is money well spent. They don't look at the opportunity cost. Should we have a opportunity cost. Should we have a better call sector? Buffett and Mer had a good way to sum this up which is never ask your barber if you need haircut. Yeah. And it's the same thing a human rights lawyer. It is in their interests rights lawyer. It is in their interests for human rights to capture a greater and greater part of public discourse at the expense of democratic bodies. And consequently, it's, you know, you're not really in the you're not really in the dispensation of justice. You're in the amplification of grievance business. It's very different. >> I want to switch gears a little bit. My kids had a question for you. >> Oh, good. Okay. Go on. A few years ago, we were in Italy on vacation and we walked into a Louis Vuitton store and they saw a purse and they were asking me what makes somebody spend I think it was I don't know 20 or 30,000 euros on a purse and I had gave them an answer but they wanted me to ask you some of those things by the way weirdly you can resell them for more than the purchase price because in some cases the Kelly bag for example they won't sell it to you until you've been a fairly reliable customer of theirs for some time and therefore the price on eBay is higher than the price they charge in the store. Um uh so so by the way it's not it it's not in it's complicated but they're vellin goods effectively a large proportion of goods depend for their value on being perceived to be expensive. >> So what goes into that though because they were we're all we're all guilty of it to a degree. No, but they were talking about the store and the service and the lighting. >> My wife just came back from, you know, somewhere where there was quite a nice night dress in Harrods, I think it was in London, which was £1,800. >> Okay. >> Now, you have to remember that there are quite a lot of goods where the purpose of the good emotionally is to say, well, let's take the endline. I often think there's a lot of hidden truth in advertising endlines. The L'Oreal advertising endlines. The L'Oreal endline because I'm worth it. Some part of that is the person advertising to themsself. So, you know, when you drive around in your brand new blinged up Tesla, albeit slightly keyed, okay, you're not actually doing it to pick up chicks, I imagine. I mean, maybe I have no idea what you do in your private time. Okay, but if you let's say private time. Okay, but if you let's say you bought a bright red sports car, yes, one purpose of it in a in a particular group would probably be, you know, I visibly have resources to spare. But quite a large part of this stuff is actually signaling to ourselves, which is, you know, uh because I'm worth it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of person who drives this. Uh it provides me with a kind of ego boost, a sense of reassurance, whatever it may be. And so consequently, if you think about part of the reason why bags became very expensive is that very high-end clothing can only be worn in quite specific situations. Mhm. situations. Mhm. >> On the other hand, a bag like a man's watch can be worn every day. So, one of the reasons why those things are expensive is to use a very interesting measure, cost per entertainment hour. I wear a Casio G-Shock. I think it was 130 quid because I' actually decided as a gross rationalist that the best watch is one that's cheap enough to wear in the shower so you don't have to take the thing off every day. But Paul Dolan, Professor Paul Dolan, who's the behavioral scientist at London School of Economics, I met him when I first met him. I said, "I'm intrigued because you've worked with Daniel Carnean on happiness and I noticed you wear a Rolex." >> Mhm. And he said, "No, no." He said, "It's extremely good value for money because it makes me feel good every single day when I put it on and in 20 years time I'll give it to my son." 21 years time, I don't know how old his son was, I'll pass it on to my son who can enjoy exactly the same thing. So, as a repository of meaning. >> Oh, interesting. >> Now, cost per entertainment hour is quite interesting because it was used to explain the fact that relatively poor young people will spend 90 $100 on a computer game, which seems like a lot of money until you realize that they might play that game for >> Oh, yeah. >> 80 90 100 hours. >> Yeah. >> Or more. >> Super cheap. >> So, it's super cheap. I mean, compared to going to the cinema where it's $10 per entertainment hour, more if you buy popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting metric. I mean, one of the things that metric. I mean, one of the things that used to make me really annoyed in Britain was when people, rich people got really snarky about poor people having large televisions. And I said, "Look, large televisions. And I said, "Look, you if you haven't got much money, TV is a source of long-term entertainment is spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a really good television on which to enjoy it because you're not going to go Porsche racing at the weekend, you know, you're not you're not going to be there, you know, effectively going to Glindborn or popping up to the bloody, you know, Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a really large television is a perfectly rational decision. >> Go deeper on this truth and endline signaling to ourselves when we purchase something. Jeffrey Miller is something. Jeffrey Miller is fundamentally right that a lot of what we're doing is to advertise ourselves to other people and the mating mind and spent two books I think you really should read because they're extremely good that a lot of a third book by my compatriate will store the status game which you must know you read it fantastic I've heard of it >> and I have to admit I'm going to the only caveat I give to reading these books a bit like reading uh the selfish gene is when you read them, you are at, you know, if you're someone of any kind of sensitivity, you are at risk of experiencing depressive episodes after reading them because not because they're not true, but because they are. And you go, God, am, you know, am I really that shallow? You know, I do things because I shallow? You know, I do things because I they feel good. I explain why I do them, but deep down the evolutionary and emotional reason I'm doing these things is really to show off or to establish, you know, some sort of oneupmanship or status. It's kind of complicated. Do I status. It's kind of complicated. Do I buy one piece of conspicuous consumption as is argued by various people like Lord Leard in the UK? Do I make my neighbors less happy if I buy a newer, better car? because what I've done is I've changed their comparative frame and therefore my pleasure comes at the expense of theirs. >> Now, that's not I don't think that's totally simple. I think if you were a totally simple. I think if you were a real car obsessive and your next door neighbor bought a Ferrari, you'd actually be delighted because you could go out and talk about torque vectoring and an adaptive air suspension or whatever it may be, okay? or the, you know, the normally aspirated V12 and you'd probably be made happier by that purchase. So, I don't think I don't purchase. So, I don't think I don't think it's absolutely simple. I think Jay Leno and Jay Leno's garage makes him one of the world's great philanthropists because he goes and spends a fortune on extremely rare cars and then shares his passion with an audience of millions. If you are a car enthusiast, you know, it's an extraordinary case, by the way, of translating money into something which is both a selfish pleasure and a generous pleasure. It's complicated. But when you read these books and you you realize that status is effectively a kind of thing within us which we can't turn off. >> The currencies will change. The status currencies change with fashion and time and everything else. Um, you know, there was a time where having a digital watch was the, you know, the the highest status thing. In my school, if you were status thing. In my school, if you were the first kid with an LED digital watch, people were in awe of you. So, these things change, but nonetheless, it's probably innate. Would it be nice if we probably innate. Would it be nice if we had the power to completely disregard the opinions of others? Well, yes and no. I mean, I think such a society might no. I mean, I think such a society might be better in some respects. I also think it would be kind of atrocious because people would kind of go shopping naked. You know, is shame necessary? It was book by Jennifer Jackwood actually, you know. I mean, as a social species, know. I mean, as a social species, patently at some level, we're massively calibrated to care about the, you know, the repute of others. And that's why some things need to be expensive because then it's a costly signal. It's peacock's tail. It's a so the guy who rescued the British sparkling wine industry effectively did so by improving quality by 10% 20% and then putting up price by about 150%. >> Cuz price is the same >> because in the sparkling in the champagne business it doesn't matter how good the drink is if people think you've bought it for $8.95 it's not doing the job it's supposed to do which is to signal generosity to signal hospitality or to mark a special occasion you know. Oh, I see you've taken out the good stuff because it's my birthday. And that's pot I mean, you're a Canadian, right? Pot latch was, I think, a right? Pot latch was, I think, a practice by the the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where they destroyed possessions. >> You know more of a Canadian history than I do. >> I I think I think it was tribes in the Northwest who practiced this pot latch thing where you destroyed things of value as kind of uh you know, a signaling mechanism. >> That that is like ultimate signal. It's like the rappers burning money on videos or something. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Signaling things that they're probably not intending to signal. >> There is a serious question here, which is can we take a an innate and immutable human instinct and harness it for good rather than for ill. And Jeffrey Miller's example here is let's imagine two parallel tribes. Bluntly put, in one tribe, the men folk signal their desiraability as mates uh by uh fighting each other with axes. >> That's a negative sum game. In the neighboring tribe, they signal their desiraability of mates by going hunting and trying to bring home meat which they then share with the rest of the tribe. That's a positive sum game. So there is this really complicated question which is undoubtedly human pursuit of status has both positive and negative externalities depending on the currency you choose to signal and also it's not totally it's not totally easy to say whether it's negative or positive. I mean, >> it probably drives a lot of human behavior which drives ambition, which drives progress, which drives >> I mean, if we genuinely didn't care, okay, if we had no shame, uh, you're absolutely right. I mean, no one, you absolutely right. I mean, no one, you know, I'm sure, by the way, I think also a lot of valuable goods are affordable now by everybody because they started as luxury goods. >> Yes. >> So, I always mention this because it's such a silly boast. My grandparents were the fourth family in Wales to own a dishwasher and it cost about hundred and something pounds at a time when their house which was a very nice house cost them £4,000. >> That dishwasher probably works better than a modern one too by the way. >> It's still working. They bought it in 195961 something like that. >> Why are they 4hour cycles now? >> And it's like yeah ready Tuesday week. Come on. You know >> I have one of these It's interesting just as a funny aside. I have one of these dryers from the 80s in my house. >> It came with the house and the >> It dries the clothes in the back. >> The repair man is like, "It's going to be just as expensive to fix this as it would be to buy a new one. I'll just assume." I was like, "No, no, fix this one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, "Tries the clothes in 30 minutes." >> I'm going to make an unusual foray into environmental responsibility here. Uh folks, everybody listening, do if if there's a do simple thing you can do, two things. put on your appliances at two things. put on your appliances at times when there is an abundance of clean electricity. You don't have to clean electricity. You don't have to change what you do. You just have to change when you do it. Secondly, if you've got a dryer that doesn't have a heat pump, get a dryer with a heat pump. >> Yeah. >> Because Yep. It's slow. I'm going to acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy efficiency of a dryer with a heat pump. Or better still, Americans, if you live in Arizona, dry your clothes outside. Because this is something that's slightly beusing because in Britain we didn't have the social stigma of hanging clothes up to dry to the same extent. Now we do now. Nobody would hold hang clothes up. But that's just a social clothes up. But that's just a social stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got a fairly climate. You're Canadian. Okay. There plenty of times of the year where your underpants can be hanging there for three months and they wouldn't not they might freeze but they wouldn't noticeably dry. But I do find it noticeably dry. But I do find it slightly weird in the US where if you're somewhere like Arizona, you could literally hang them up for I I was in Fa Ventura in an island in the Canaries. And well, the amusing thing was you literally they had a washing machine but no dryer. You put it up on the line no dryer. You put it up on the line about 40 minutes later it was ready to wear. >> So how would you market that to people? How would you change the >> change the behavior so that it's not necessary? Now I understand that people necessary? Now I understand that people don't want to put their underpants, you know, private things. I suspect that a lot of it is those weird housing associations already have rules that say you can't do it and then bit by bit the social norm spreads. >> Those American housing associations basically like living in a Nazi regime, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, it's like those co-op apartments in New York which are you I mean in London we never tolerate that degree of kind of uh intrusion before we're allowed to move into a property. The interesting thing about the co-op apartments in particular, from what I understand, I don't understand everything, so I may be speaking a bit about something I don't know, is the degree to which all people play it. >> Yes. >> Whether you're uh sort of like a student just graduating or you're a billionaire, you're all sort of like playing this this game uh in the co-op housing. But >> no, no, it is completely a game. And apparently they can demand information which the IRS can't demand. I mean, it is, you know, it is absolutely bizarre. you have a co-op board which will uh you know in occasion kick people out as well. But what probably happens is that well. But what probably happens is that once this is very similar by the way with the necessity of children playing outside which is once the behavior drops below a certain threshold you have an inflection point. Mhm. >> So my my parents couldn't believe this when I when I was 20 25 and I told them that when I was 11 I used to cycle 11 miles to the nearest town to see my grandmother on my own at the age of 11 and then when I told them which they did know I used to at the age of sort of 11 climb up onto the apex of the roof and just wander around on the roof 30t up. >> Yes. >> My parents were a gasast that they'd ever allowed it to happen. But if most people did that >> at the time it was normal. >> It was completely normal. Yeah, >> you'll be locked up today. My parents would have been locked up for sever, you know, several of the things which I was allowed to do uh when I was young. Now, what happens, I think, is that you reach a a threshold or a tipping point where in my childhood, let's say someone had abducted me or I'd been hit by a car, okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year 1974,75,76, that kind of era. If I'd been hit by a car cycling to Mammoth or I'd been abducted by a pedophile, uh, okay, my parents would have been described as unlucky. >> You get past a threshold where that behavior becomes weird and now my parents will be held as irresponsible and would be blamed. >> Yeah, >> I don't think it occurred to them. I was, funnily enough, hit by a car. It was my fault, be honest. I failed to signal before maneuvering. I was hit by a car. Nobody suggested it was my a car. Nobody suggested it was my parents fault for allowing me to cycle around the place. that was just a normal thing you did and then you get these weird I've got a few theories um for example what are the things that are products of social norms where you can suddenly hit a threshold tattoos among the middle class would have been an interesting thing in Britain is this true in Canada as well so perfectly middle-class people now have body art and it's normalized it would have been deeply weird in any middle class millier to see someone with a to uh in the 1970s or 1960s. >> It's just normal. I mean, like everybody >> No, no, no. I know. But I mean, this you you got to be you got to be 59 to notice this stuff. A lot of it happens over this stuff. A lot of it happens over quite a long time. Fresh. >> It's been a slow. >> I've got a theory that all British men would wear shorts all the time if it weren't for social pressure. >> I also think for example, okay, here's an interesting one. I don't know if you're into paranal sunning. Are you? >> What is this? It's a Buddhist practice where you basically expose your paranneeium to direct sunlight. Um I think that a fairly large proportion of the population are naturists to an extent by which I don't mean wandering around the streets with their schlongs out. But I mean that on a beach in a field in sunny weather in you know in some sort of privacy they would like to wander around with no clothes on because it's good for you. It exposes your whole body to sunlight. You get a lot of vitamin D. You know, it's generally healthful. And my argument generally healthful. And my argument about sunbathing is well, you know, evolution made it pretty enjoyable, maybe it's not all bad. And there are some schools of thought in dermatology which made a case that actually weirdly although it in enhances the risk of skin cancer, it improves cardiovascular health. So there was a study actually health. So there was a study actually among Swedes where there was a higher instance of skin cancer among Swedish sunbed addicts but they actually had a higher life expectancy which they didn't expect. >> So quite often you see what we do is we measure the narrow effect of a behavior but not the broader effect. Quite interesting in terms of >> you know how we might get things wrong. By the way, I wouldn't do it on a beach as there were children present and then you know, but if you go to if you go to parts of the of Europe, particularly Germans will just wander around naked. Now, I think at some level if they're no children. Now, in the United States, children. Now, in the United States, that would be perceived in a completely different way. So, quite a lot of these different way. So, quite a lot of these things are arbitrary. They're just in other words, you know, if doing something makes you weird, there is a point at which you reach a threshold, vegetarianism, veganism, etc., where it where it goes from being weird to mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is it's not an even process, >> right? >> And sometimes you never get to the threshold. >> I I see what you're saying. I know we're coming up to time here. I want to get to a couple questions. What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? I think a large part of it comes that? I think a large part of it comes down to, you know, Michael Pollani and his idea of a tacit skill, which is we know more than we can tell. There are some generally good rules, which is write conversationally, much more conversationally than people think they should write because everybody thinks they have to write a a and actually I'll give you two examples of this. David Oglevie, all his books are incredibly readable because I think he was a copywriter first and an author second. His pro style is very good and he also adopts a clever trick which I've stolen and which uh a few other people is that he writes extremely plainly for the most part but will throw in the odd cescoilian long word just to remind the reader that he you know you're not an idiot. You know it's almost there to idiot. You know it's almost there to flatter the reader as much as it is to flatter the writer. Conan Doyle, I was talking to Rick Rubin about this. He and I both grew up on those Sherlock Holmes short stories which are not only models of thinking and deduction and uh you know and a fantastic lesson for uh mental gymnastics. I think they're also mental gymnastics. I think they're also the Kingsley Amos believed this that he's one of the greatest pros writers in the English language because bear in mind a lot of that stuff's written in 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's written in 1880 does that what's that mean? Oh god, hold on. I'll have to go back to page 27 to work out how who on earth Mr. Homer Angel is or uh Miss Miss Mary missed something sudden, doesn't there, Marlin? At no point in reading a Sherlock Holmes short story have I ever had to go back a page to work out how who somebody is. Yeah. >> In terms of just absolutely brilliant clarity, uh those are astonishing. But in terms of persuasion, uh there are various things. So you use generally verbs of movement. You you use verbs in preference to adjectives and adjectives in preference to adverbs. I think you tend to use Anglo-Saxon words rather than the romance words for the most part without being silly about it. You convert a feature into a benefit. There's also an element where sometimes all you need to do is tell people a fact. Now I don't know any evidence fact. Now I don't know any evidence about this and I'd like to know it and I asked this question which is of the people who are antiaxers during co was there a difference between the people who are basically happy with the idea of a vaccine and the people who weren't partly driven by whether you knew that vaccination dated back to the 18th century and smallox. In other words it was a 250y old medical practice >> or whether you thought it was some weird new fangle thing that you couldn't possibly trust. I don't know. But possibly trust. I don't know. But sometimes, do you ever watch Press Telw Walker on YouTube? You know those mathematical puzzles, geometry puzzles? I really recommend them because weirdly I find myself on YouTube watching people solve mathematical equations for fun, which I never thought I'd do. But Fresh Telw Walker and I can't remember what it's called something like something decision or something. Anyway, um it's great great little YouTube channel. It's not that little. a huge following and sometimes there's a geometry puzzle which looks completely impossible to solve until you just draw one extra line at which point the solution becomes obvious. And so sometimes in marketing obvious. And so sometimes in marketing all you've got to do is tell people a fact. It's not always about persuasion. fact. It's not always about persuasion. It's not always about getting people it's simply putting people in a you know state of knowledge or belief or conviction that this thing can make a difference to their lives. And by the way, you're not you're almost always up against a problem, which is that the two human default modes of do what everybody else does and do what I've done before for obvious reasons. You know, what you've done before and what everybody else always does is not necessarily optimal, but it's much less likely to be catastrophic than trying something new that nobody else ever does. You know, so we're kind of herd species and we're kind of habitual species. So in the marketing of something which is genuinely new you know your the Tesla the the electric car there is a degree of extreme anxiety which you don't encounter when you repeat buy or when you buy the brand leader >> there's like a resistance you have to overcome >> you have to yeah you have to overcome it because just as a camera has a default mode the human default mode is do what I did before do what everybody else does I feel comfortable doing that very very rational default mode there's Nothing silly about that in terms of if you think about it our evolutionary um brain architecture those two things make a lot of sense but um it does mean and something I only realized about a year ago 35 years after I started working in the business is that as a consequence of that big innovative new ideas don't require less marketing they require more because you're asking people to at the initial stages you're asking someone to do something that nobody else has done >> and you're asking them to do something they haven't done before both of which create a kind of disqu and so providing people with conviction and reassurance quite often I suspect by the way in the early stages of a technology that happens one to one that you know it was my brother who's he's an astrophysicist so he knows all the bloody maths about kilowatt hours and stuff so my brother provided me with the reassurance to buy my first electric car I don't think if he hadn't bought an electric car I've now had Three, would I have bought an electric car? No, >> probably not. >> Probably not. >> Yeah. >> Uh, it will be my brother who persuades me to get solar panels or a heat pump or something of that kind. But big ideas don't require the the classic geek idea is our idea is so good it will sell itself. >> A re since your fellow Canadian Stuart Butterfield, isn't it? Who founded um Slack? Yeah. Is that right? Slack? Yeah. Is that right? >> Yeah. Uh he says the only real measure of innovation is behavioral change. that the only real measure of whether an innovation is significant is whether it h it both in first order and second order ways changes the way people behave. Now an interesting question is behave. Now an interesting question is is AI at that point yet? And my second question is the lesson of all tech is that loads and loads of geeks compete through for technological numerical superiority by some measure or other. And then someone else comes along with a cute user interface and makes all the money. It's basically Steve Jobs. money. It's basically Steve Jobs. >> Yeah. >> Nobody's done that yet for AI. Now maybe this weird thing that Johnny Iv is concocting which is some sort of weird pendant which talks to your mobile phone. Maybe that's what it is. phone. Maybe that's what it is. >> There was this thing that sort of relates to that which was Bill Gates had this saying. He's like the best and you this saying. He's like the best and you know I have friends living this now. The best technology doesn't win. >> That's a very engineering point of view because you're judging technology by its um engineering qualities rather than its uh human appeal. >> Oh that's an interesting reframing. >> So uh there are there are people in every field like in the camera world there are people called measure baiters. They're they're denigrated as measure baiters because they're obsessed with the numerical qualities of the camera. >> Yeah. >> You know, you focal lengths and all that stuff and they don't take very good photographs. >> Yes. >> And um saying that the best I mean undoubtedly by the way I mean you know Betamax is the famous example where they failed to capture network effects and in a world where there are network effects. Yeah. By the way, the best technology probably often doesn't win. I think that's probably fair. Everybody was competing to make a slightly faster IBM compatible PC, but they were all gray and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world would go, "The slight problem with this PC isn't the fact that the clock speed or the processing power or the RAM is insufficient. The problem is if I put insufficient. The problem is if I put this device in any room of my house, it turns that room into an office." >> Yeah. If you put an IBM PC, a gray IBM PC in any room in your house, including the you might as well put a photocopier and a bloody filing cabinet in the room, right? Whereas when Jolly IV comes along and has that lickable, the iMac, >> the you can actually put that in any room of the house and it it it actually enhances passion statement. >> It's fantastic. It's, you know, it's an adornment. And so their failure to understand the wider context within which they were operating which is the job of marketing is exactly the reason nerds hate marketing because they think in a perfect world nerd metrics win out. But the consumer is much more bothered by the fact that when you get to the bottom of the iPhone scroll, it gives the little bounce, you know, and we you could, if we're to be absolutely honest, you could ridicule um uh you know, Ives and Jobs over their obsession with uh you know, bezels and chfers and things like that. But of course, multiply that like that. But of course, multiply that by a billion owners using the thing a 100 times a day. Okay, that's a 100red billion encounters and that probably matters a lot more in fact than you know by the way I mean I lost faith in Apple when they canled the car. How interesting. >> Because I thought you they had the brand power to create for places like New York and London a form of microtransport which was really really cool, really really efficient. You know the brand really efficient. You know the brand power you have, you see, you know, if you're Apple or Ford or whatever, people will buy a weird product from you much more readily than they will from Alfa Romeo, >> right? >> Because they go, well, if Ford's doing it, it, you know, it must be okay. So, one of the gifts of having a strong brand is your power to really disrupt and create new categories, you know, new categories of transit, for example, which we need. You know, don't get me wrong, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to off 600 horsepower electric car, but when I go into London, I want a Microlino or an itty bitty little thing because that's appropriate to the task. And my argument is that they could have done something there. They could have used their power to do something and and you know, the finance people killed it really. It was what was it called? project something or other it called? project something or other never remember but but no now they're just changing the shape of things and making the camera a bit better come on guys produce by the way do you want a good tip okay I tend to buy and this will actually apply to electric cars as well always good reason to buy Korean stuff do you know why >> because they're going to do that anyway the Koreans are going to make fantastic tech and fantastic cars regardless of the profit motive do you know why to wind up the Japanese so they've got two motivations Okay. Other people are just trying to make money. Deep down. Do you know do you money. Deep down. Do you know do you know why the largest Episcopalian church in the world is in Soul? >> No. >> Right. This is really fascinating. I'm going to Soul for the first time. I've never been. But the last four presidents of Korea have been variously like Catholic Presbyterian. Now before um before the Japanese invasion, Christianity was a tiny niche missionary religion in Korea. Uh when the Japanese invaded um uh the tiny Christian population refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor and some of them were martyed for refusing to effectively uh pay due respect to the divinity of the Japanese emperor and therefore it became the patriotic religion because it was seen as a deeply patriotic entity. So I've got a hunch that you you know deep down you know if you go buy a Hyundai or a Genesis or something like that there's a dual motivation here. Let's make a bit of money and uh but that's that's purely so similarly if you want to look for anthropological reasons to buy um an awful lot of German businesses are driven by sibling rivalry. >> So Puma versus Adidas Aldi North versus Aldi South. There's a whole weird family Aldi South. There's a whole weird family rift in the German car industry which is too complicated for me to understand about Porsche and the family who own Pinchit. There are a whole load of Pinchit. There are a whole load of families which are kind of weird waring families and sometimes the family business has a motivation which actually >> the consumer is the winner. >> But the consumer is the is exactly the winner in in all this. Um but but going back to that family business thing that you know undoubtedly if you can harness other motivations alongside the profit motives most people working for a company unless you've bought them off with massive stock options because they're in the senior management most people don't get up in the morning to enrich the share owners. No, >> you know I don't get up you I don't get up every morning I don't know what a big shareholder is of my company. It's probably like the state of Wisconsin DMV pension fund. Well, for the best wish pension fund. Well, for the best wish will I don't wish them any ill will. Of course, I don't get up in the morning cuz I go, "Oh, I really worry about those DMV people's pensions in Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. I can worry about colleagues. That's a natural human motivation to serve those people. We always end with the same people. We always end with the same question, which is what is success for you? >> Just expanding the adjacent possible. That's a very pretentious article, but push the pebble a bit further. That that's it. I mean, you know, one of the reasons I do a lot of this stickick stuff is because the feedback I got was every now and then someone comes up to me and says, "I made a different decision because of something you said. Someone said to me, I bought my house because of you." I thought they might be about to hit me. We still hear from people about our first podcast every two or three months. Somebody emails me and and says, you know, because of that, oh, I love this. I never heard of this person. looked them up. And one thing I'm really clear on and I we've made this mistake. All creative people have made this mistake which is to go no that rationality is silly. What you need is creativity. No, silly. What you need is creativity. No, no. What you need is two strings to your bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode of problem solving. It works best in parallel with some rational or quantitative or datadriven measures. But the quantitative and datadriven measures should not be allowed to crowd it out. And so when I say the reason someone bought a house because of me is I said when you're looking for a house don't optimize because everybody will want that house. Instead find something the house has which most people won't like but you don't care about next to a pub. Now I'm not saying next to a rough pub. I don't want to have fights outside my house. But most people particularly older people would hate the idea of being next to a pub because they crap on about noise and the beer garden and all that stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a good happy pub is music to me. I don't get a sleep before midnight anyway so it's not going to keep me awake. Railway line personally it to me it's a bonus to most people it's negative. Go and look for those things where you can arbitrage >> uh what's possible. That would be my attitude. Now similarly if you've got a attitude. Now similarly if you've got a problem to solve >> don't purely define the problem in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in America you have a temperature and you have a feels like temperature which is by the way very very intelligent thing because what makes us feel hot is not just the ambient temperature. It's a combination ambient temperature. It's a combination of temperature, humidity, breeze and I think there's one other factor when they do the feels like temperature there's something like temperature so many feet above the ground that they factor in. Um now when I'm going outside I'm not going to do chemical experiments. I don't need to know what the ambient temperature is. I need to know will I feel hot and in the same way I think there's something really important here which is that do not define an objective which is designed to serve human beings without considering psychological factors because you might be able to solve your problem very very cheaply and efficiently by changing the psychology not by changing the technology >> and provided people are looking at both with a reasonable amount of imagination I'm not I'm not angry with a well bit. I'm I'm only angry with accountants and lawyers and economists, not because they do what they do, but because they have too much power doing it and they've achieved a kind of monopoly over decision-m which I don't think they have a reasonable claim to. >> That's a brilliant place to end this. >> It is not a bad place to end though. Fantastic. >> Thank you very much. We're not going to wait nine years before nine years before we get back together. How often are you in London? >> Uh once or twice a year. Mhm. >> Yeah. >> Oh, we must meet up then. That would be fantastic. >> Definitely. Loading video analysis...
