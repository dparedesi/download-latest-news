Spices have been a cornerstone of South Indian commerce for centuries, and Chennai, with its strategic port location, has long been a key player in this trade. The prominence of chilli highlights its significance in South Indian cuisine and culture. While modern supermarkets and online platforms are changing consumer habits, wholesale markets like those in George Town continue to serve an essential function in the supply chain. Colin Todhunter is an independent researcher and writer and has spent many years in India. He is a research associate of the Centre for Research on Globalisation (Montreal) and writes on food, agriculture and development issues. In 2018, in recognition of his writing, he was named a Living Peace and Justice Leader and Model by Engaging Peace Inc. ùêÇùê®ùê•ùê¢ùêß ùêìùê®ùêùùê°ùêÆùêßùê≠ùêûùê´ ‚Äì Academia.edu Aruna Rodrigues, lead petitioner in the GMO mustard Public Interest Litigation in the Supreme Court of India, stated the following about the author‚Äôs 2022 e-book Food, Dispossession and Dependency. Resisting the New World Order: ‚ÄúColin Todhunter at his best: this is graphic, a detailed horror tale in the making for India, an expos√© on what is planned, via the farm laws, to hand over Indian sovereignty and food security to big business. There will come a time pretty soon ‚Äî (not something out there but imminent, unfolding even now), when we will pay the Cargills, Ambanis, Bill Gates, Walmarts ‚Äî in the absence of national buffer food stocks (an agri policy change to cash crops, the end to small-scale farmers, pushed aside by contract farming and GM crops) ‚Äî we will pay them to send us food and finance borrowing from international markets to do it.‚Äù Frederic Mousseau, Policy Director at the Oakland Institute, says the following about the author‚Äôs work: ‚ÄúIt takes a book to break down the dynamics that are pushing agro-chemical agriculture to farmers and consumers around the world and to reveal the strength of the diverse movement of people and organizations who stand in the way of these destructive and predatory forces. ‚ÄúColin Todhunter takes readers on a world tour that makes a compelling case against the fallacy of the food scarcity and Green Revolution arguments advanced by the mainstream media and international institutions on behalf of powerful financial interests such as Blackrock, Vanguard, or Gates. Todhunter makes it obvious that a key factor of world hunger and of the environmental crisis we are facing is a capitalist system that ‚Äòrequires constant growth, expanding markets and sufficient demand.‚Äô ‚ÄúUplifting rather than depressing, after this lucid diagnosis, he highlights some of the countless people-led initiatives and movements, from Cuba, Ethiopia to India, that fight back against destruction and predation with agroecology and farmers-led practices, respectful of the people and the planet. By debunking the ‚Äúartificial scarcity‚Äù myth that is constantly fed to us, Todhunter demonstrates that it is actually not complicated to change course. Readers will just have to join the movement.‚Äù This ebook provides insight into aspects of the global food system, including the micronutrient crisis, contested climate emergency rhetoric and its use in implementing the rollout of controlling technologies, the emergence and influence of digital platforms in shaping agricultural practices and the increasing corporate capture of Indian agriculture. The book is the third installment in a trilogy of ebooks by the author exploring the global food system. It evolved from a series of articles originally published by various media outlets and written by the author and follows the February 2022 publication of Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order and the December 2023 release of Sickening Profits: The Global Food System‚Äôs Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. When read together, the three books provide an overarching critique of contemporary food systems and possible solutions. For instance, the first book presents a more in-depth discussion of agroecology, the role of the Gates Foundation, the impact of pesticides, the state of agriculture in India, including the 2020-21 farmers protest, and the issue of development. The second book touches on some of those issues but broadens the debate to look at ecomodernism, food-related ill health, the role of big finance in the food system and the post-Covid food crisis. While readers do not have to read the first two books, it might help in providing added context and insights. This new book draws on and develops many of the themes presented in the first two. In particular, it returns to India to explore what has happened over the last 22 months (since the publication of the first book). More generally, it looks at the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation that is undermining democratic processes, economic diversity and local autonomy. This unholy alliance is creating a self-reinforcing, technocratic dystopia that concentrates power in the hands of a super-wealthy elite, which increasingly depicts anyone who challenges it as the ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô. In this respect, the book weds the topic of food to the wider dynamics of power in society, which is becoming increasingly concentrated, resulting in the domination of both resources and populations and seeking to shape the very fabric of our lives and beliefs about who we are and what we could or should be. Such an analysis is integral to gaining a deeper understanding of the food system and the influence of global agribusiness and the tech giants that are increasingly moving into the food and agriculture sector. The following discussion is driven by a conviction in the transformative power of re-localising food systems, revitalising traditional ecological wisdom and rekindling our connection to the land that nourishes us. At its core, it challenges us to question our understanding of human progress and development. By focusing on the nature of power and certain challenges and issues that we face, this introductory chapter establishes a foundational framework for what appears in the subsequent chapters. We live in a world that sees political power becoming increasingly centralised. In turn, this creates an environment ripe for corporate influence. Large corporations, with their vast resources, can more easily focus their lobbying efforts and capture policymaking bodies at national and international levels than at a more fragmented local or regional level, leading to regulations and laws that favour big business over small enterprises and the needs and rights of ordinary people. This results in a landscape dominated by a handful of corporate giants, each wielding enormous economic and political clout. This consolidation of corporate power further reinforces political centralisation, as wealthy corporations (for example, think big pharma and big agribusiness) can effectively dictate policy through campaign contributions, lobbying efforts and the revolving door between government and industry. The voice of the average citizen is drowned out by the influence of corporate power. As a result of this corporate monopolisation, local markets and small businesses, once the backbone of communities, are being systematically crushed under the weight of centralised state-corporate power. Unable to compete with the economies of scale and political influence of large corporations, they are forced to close their doors or sell out to larger entities. This not only reduces choice and drives up prices but also strips communities of their unique character and economic self-determination. The global interests served by this system are at odds with local needs and values. Decisions made in distant boardrooms and government offices fail to account for the nuanced realities of diverse communities. Environmental concerns are brushed aside in favour of short-term profits, while cultural traditions are homogenised to fit corporate needs. Democratic processes, designed to give voice to the many, are subverted to serve the interests of the few. Real power resides in the hands of those who control the purse strings, and public discourse is shaped by the corporate media (often part of larger conglomerates), limiting the range of ideas and stifling dissent. At the same time, when decision-making is concentrated in a few hands, the potential for catastrophic errors increases. Over-centralised, corporate-dominated supply chains are vulnerable to disruptions, leading to shortages of essential goods that can ripple across the globe. The consolidation of corporate power in key sectors like agriculture creates dangerous monopolies that can manipulate markets, exploit farmers and ignore environmental safeguards with impunity. The struggle against the intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation is a battle for a future where power is distributed equitably, where local voices matter and where the interests of communities and the environment take precedence over corporate profits. The stakes could not be higher. If we fail to check the runaway consolidation of political and corporate power, we risk sliding into a form of corporate feudalism or techno-feudalism, where the vast majority of people are reduced to serfs in service of a powerful elite. More specifically, the consolidation of corporate power in food and agriculture has far-reaching and deeply concerning implications for farmers, ordinary people and the environment. This concentration of control in the hands of a few transnational corporations has created a system that prioritises profit over ecological sustainability, health and food sovereignty. For farmers, the consequences are dire. The consolidation of the agriculture industry has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of small farms. The shift towards large-scale industrial farming has not only pushed many small farmers out of business but also trapped those who remain in a cycle of dependency on a handful of corporations for seeds, chemicals and market access. This loss of autonomy leaves farmers vulnerable to exploitative practices and reduces their ability to make decisions based on local needs and conditions. The impact on the wider population is equally troubling. While the illusion of choice persists in grocery stores, the reality is that a small number of corporations control the majority of food products. This concentration of power allows these companies to manipulate prices via aggressive discounting to destroy competition or to engage in profiteering through unnecessary price increases. Moreover, the focus on highly profitable, low-cost-ingredient processed foods high in fats, sugars and salt has contributed to a global health crisis, with rising rates of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases. Environmentally, the consequences of this corporate-controlled system are catastrophic. The industrial agricultural model promoted by these large corporations relies heavily on chemical inputs, monoculture farming and practices that degrade soil health, waterways and biodiversity. The centralisation of food production and distribution has also created a dangerously fragile system. As the COVID event demonstrated, disruptions in this highly consolidated supply chain can quickly lead to food shortages and price spikes. This lack of resilience poses a serious threat to global food security, particularly in times of crisis. Perhaps most alarmingly, this consolidated system is eroding food sovereignty ‚Äî the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. As global corporations increasingly control what is grown and how it is distributed, local communities lose the ability to make decisions about their food systems. The adverse implications of corporate consolidation in our food and agriculture system are profound and far-reaching. They threaten not only our current food security and public health but also the long-term sustainability of the planet‚Äôs food production capacity. Addressing this issue is not just about changing our food system; it‚Äôs about reclaiming democratic rights and ensuring a just and sustainable future for all. In India, as will be shown, the trends outlined above have concerning implications. These trends, driven by neoliberal policies and the growing influence of transnational corporations, are reshaping the landscape of Indian agriculture in ways that threaten traditional farming practices, food security and rural livelihoods. One of the most significant impacts is on small and marginal farmers, who make up about 85 per cent of India‚Äôs farming community (the importance of small farms will be discussed later). As corporate entities gain more control over various stages of the agricultural chain, these farmers face increasing pressure and vulnerability. They often find themselves at a disadvantage when negotiating prices or accessing markets, leading to reduced incomes and increased debt. The consolidation of power in the hands of a few large corporations also poses a threat to India‚Äôs food sovereignty. As these companies gain control over seeds, inputs and distribution channels, we could see a further reduction in crop diversity and a shift towards monoculture (contract) farming. This may also exacerbate the overuse of money-spinning proprietary chemical inputs, the degradation of soil and human health and the depletion of water resources, which are already major concerns in the country. The environmental costs of this approach are significant and could have long-lasting impacts on India‚Äôs agricultural productivity and food security. Furthermore, the corporatisation of agriculture threatens to erode traditional farming knowledge and practices that have been developed over generations. These practices, often more suited to local ecological conditions and more sustainable in the long term, risk being lost as standardised, corporate-driven farming ends up commodifying knowledge and practices (this will become clear later). The impact on rural communities extends beyond just the economic sphere. As the corporatisation of agriculture takes hold, there‚Äôs a risk of further rural-urban migration, as small farmers are pushed off their land. This can lead to the breakdown of rural social structures and exacerbate urban poverty and unemployment. The influence of corporate interests on agricultural research and policy is also a matter of concern. When private sector funding becomes more dominant in agricultural research, there is a risk that research priorities become skewed towards corporate interests rather than the needs of small farmers or ecological sustainability. Across the globe, an insidious corporatisation is reshaping agriculture. The consequences of this shift are far-reaching and deeply troubling, touching every aspect of the food system and, by extension, the very fabric of our societies. These corporations tell us that such a process goes hand in hand with the modernisation of the sector. The narrative of the need to ‚Äòmodernise agriculture‚Äô pushed by corporations like Bayer, Corteva and Syngenta is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to secure control of the agricultural sector and ensure corporate dependency. Their vision of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô entails decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, systematically weakening traditional local governance structures, and pushing top-down policies that favour large-scale industrial farming at the expense of small-scale, diversified agriculture. Ultimately, the struggle against corporate consolidation in agriculture is not just about changing our food system. It‚Äôs about recognising that food is not just a commodity but a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of our cultures and communities. There is a battle for the soul of our food system, for the future of our rural communities, for the health of our ecosystems and for the very nature of our societies. It‚Äôs a fight we cannot afford to lose. We must stand united to reclaim our food sovereignty and build a food system that nourishes not just our bodies but our communities. A fundamental restructuring of our food and agriculture systems is required. This should include antitrust enforcement to break up corporate monopolies, policies that support small and medium-sized farms and investment in research for agroecological farming methods. We must also work to shorten supply chains, promoting local food systems and territorial markets that are more resilient and responsive to community needs. The path ahead is challenging, but the alternative of a world where our food system is controlled by a handful of corporations, where biodiversity is decimated, where farmers are reduced to serfs on their own land and where our health is sacrificed for corporate profits is simply unacceptable. The world is experiencing a micronutrient food and health crisis. Micronutrient deficiency now affects billions of people. Micronutrients are key vitamins and minerals and deficiencies can cause severe health conditions. They are important for various functions, including blood clotting, brain development, the immune system, energy production and bone health, and play a critical role in disease prevention. The root of the crisis is due to an increased reliance on ultra processed foods (‚Äòjunk food‚Äô) and the way that modern food crops are grown in terms of the seeds used, the plants produced, the synthetic inputs required (fertilisers, pesticides etc.) and the effects on soil. In 2007, nutritional therapist David Thomas noted a precipitous change in the USA towards convenience and pre-prepared foods often devoid of vital micronutrients yet packed with a cocktail of chemical additives, including colourings, flavourings and preservatives. He noted that between 1940 and 2002 the character, growing methods, preparation, source and ultimate presentation of basic staples had changed significantly to the extent that trace elements and micronutrient contents have been severely depleted. Thomas added that ongoing research clearly demonstrates a significant relationship between deficiencies in micronutrients and physical and mental ill health. Prior to the Green Revolution, many of the older crops that were displaced carried dramatically higher counts of nutrients per calorie. For instance, the iron content of millet is four times that of rice, and oats carry four times more zinc than wheat. As a result, between 1961 and 2011, the protein, zinc and iron contents of the world‚Äôs directly consumed cereals declined by 4 per cent, 5 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. The authors of a 2010 paper in the International Journal of Environmental and Rural Development state that cropping systems promoted by the Green Revolution have resulted in reduced food-crop diversity and decreased availability of micronutrients. They note that micronutrient malnutrition is causing increased rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis in many lower income nations. They add that soils are increasingly affected by micronutrient disorders. In 2016, India‚Äôs Central Soil Water Conservation Research and Training Institute reported that the country was losing 5,334 million tonnes of soil every year due to soil erosion because of indiscreet and excessive use of fertilisers, insecticides and pesticides over the years. On average, 16.4 tonnes of fertile soil is lost every year per hectare. It concluded that the non-judicious use of synthetic fertilisers had led to the deterioration of soil fertility causing loss of micro and macronutrients leading to poor soils and low yields. The high-input, chemical-intensive Green Revolution with its hybrid seeds and synthetic fertilisers and pesticides helped the drive towards greater monocropping and has resulted in less diverse diets and less nutritious foods. Its long-term impact has led to soil degradation and mineral imbalances, which, in turn, have adversely affected human health. But micronutrient depletion is not just due to a displacement of nutrient-dense staples in the diet or unhealthy soils. Take wheat, for example. Rothamsted Research in the UK has evaluated the mineral concentration of archived wheat grain and soil samples from the Broadbalk Wheat Experiment. The experiment began in 1843, and the findings show significant decreasing trends in the concentrations of zinc, copper, iron and magnesium in wheat grain since the 1960s. The researchers say that the concentrations of these four minerals remained stable between 1845 and the mid 1960s but have since decreased significantly by 20-30 per cent. This coincided with the introduction of Green Revolution semi-dwarf, high-yielding cultivars. They noted that the concentrations in soil used in the experiment have either increased or remained stable. So, in this case, soil is not the issue. A 2021 paper that appeared in the journal of Environmental and Experimental Botany reported that the large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has occurred since the Green Revolution and the introduction of its cultivars. Reflecting the findings of Rothamsted Research in the UK, a recent study led by Indian Council of Agricultural Research scientists found the grains eaten in India have lost food value. They conclude that many of today‚Äôs crops fail to absorb sufficient nutrients even when soil is healthy. The January 2024 article Indians consuming rice and wheat low in food value, high in toxins on the Down to Earth website reported on a study that found that rice and wheat, which meet over 50 per cent of the daily energy requirements of people in India, have lost up to 45 per cent of their food value in the past 50 years or so. The concentration of essential nutrients like zinc and iron has decreased by 33 per cent and 27 per cent in rice and by 30 per cent and 19 per cent in wheat, respectively. At the same time, the concentration of arsenic, a toxic element, in rice has increased by 1,493 per cent. Down to Earth also cites research by the Indian Council of Medical Research that indicates a 25 per cent rise in non-communicable diseases among the Indian population from 1990 to 2016. India is home to one-third of the two billion global population suffering from micronutrient deficiency. This is partly because modern-bred cultivars of rice and wheat are less efficient in sequestering zinc and iron, regardless of their abundance in soils. Plants have lost their capacity to take up nutrients from the soil. Increasing prevalence of diabetes, childhood leukaemia, childhood obesity, cardiovascular disorders, infertility, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis, mental illnesses and so on have all been shown to have some direct relationship to diet and specifically micronutrient deficiency. The large increase in the proportion of the global population suffering from zinc and iron deficiency over the last four decades has coincided with the global expansion of high-yielding, input-responsive cereal cultivars released in the post-Green Revolution era. Agriculture and policy analyst Devinder Sharma says that high yield is inversely proportionate to plant nutrition: the drop in nutrition levels is so much that the high-yielding new wheat varieties have seen a steep fall in copper content, an essential trace mineral, by as much as 80 per cent, and some nutritionists ascribe this to a rise in cholesterol-related incidences across the world. India is self-sufficient in various staples, but many of these foodstuffs are high calorie-low nutrient and have led to the displacement of more nutritionally diverse cropping systems and more nutrient-dense crops. The importance of agronomist William Albrecht should not be overlooked here and his work on healthy soils and healthy people. In his experiments, he found that cows fed on less nutrient-dense crops ate more while cows that ate nutrient-rich grass stopped eating once their nutritional intake was satisfied. This may be one reason why we see rising rates of obesity at a time of micronutrient food insecurity. It is interesting that, given the above discussion on the Green Revolution‚Äôs adverse impacts on nutrition, the paper New Histories of the Green Revolution (2019) by Prof. Glenn Stone debunks the claim that the Green Revolution boosted productivity: it merely put more (nutrient-deficient) wheat into the Indian diet at the expense of other food crops. Stone argues that food productivity per capita showed no increase or even actually decreased. . . With this in mind, the table below makes for interesting reading. The data is provided by the National Productivity Council India (an autonomous body of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, Ministry of Commerce and Industry). As mentioned earlier with reference to Albrecht, obesity has become a concern worldwide, including in India. This problem is multi-dimensional and, as alluded to, excess calorific intake and nutrient-poor food is a factor, leading to the consumption of sugary, fat-laden ultra processed food in an attempt to fill the nutritional gap. But there is also considerable evidence linking human exposure to agrochemicals with obesity. The September 2020 paper Agrochemicals and Obesity in the journal Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology summarises human epidemiological evidence and experimental animal studies supporting the association between agrochemical exposure and obesity and outlines possible mechanistic underpinnings for this link. Numerous other studies have also noted that exposure to pesticides has been associated with obesity and diabetes. For example, a 2022 paper in the journal Endocrine reports that first contact with environmental pesticides occurs during critical phases of life, such as gestation and lactation, which can lead to damage in central and peripheral tissues, subsequently programming disorders early and later in life. A 2013 paper in the journal Entropy on pathways to modern diseases reported that glyphosate (the active ingredient in Bayer-Monsanto‚Äôs Roundup), the most popular herbicide used worldwide, enhances the damaging effects of other food borne chemical residues and environmental toxins. The negative impact is insidious and manifests slowly over time as inflammation damages cellular systems throughout the body, resulting in conditions associated with a Western diet, which include gastrointestinal disorders, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, depression, autism, infertility, cancer and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Despite these findings, campaigner Rosemary Mason has drawn attention to how official government and industry narratives try to divert attention from the role of glyphosate in obesity (and other conditions) by urging the public to exercise and cut down on ‚Äúbiscuits‚Äù. In a January 2024 article, Kit Knightly, on the OffGuardian website, notes how big pharma is attempting to individualise obesity and make millions by pushing its ‚Äòmedical cures‚Äô and drugs for the condition. To deal with micronutrient deficiencies, other money-spinning initiatives for industry are being pushed, not least biofortification of foodstuffs and plants and genetic engineering. Industry narratives have nothing to say about the food system itself in terms of food being regarded as just another commodity to be rinsed for profit regardless of the impacts on human health or the environment. We simply witness more techno-fix ‚Äòsolutions‚Äô being rolled out to supposedly address the impacts of previous ‚Äòinnovations‚Äô and policy decisions that benefitted the bottom line of Western agribusiness (and big pharma, which profits from the rising rates of disease and conditions). Quick techno-fixes do not offer genuine solutions to the problems outlined above. Such solutions involve challenging corporate power that shapes narratives and policies to suit its agenda. Healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies are not created at some ever-sprawling life sciences park that specialises in manipulating food and the human body (for corporate gain) under the banner of ‚Äòinnovation‚Äô and ‚Äòhealth‚Äô while leaving intact the power relations that underpin bad food and ill health. A radical overhaul of the food system is required, from how food is grown to how society should be organised. This involves creating food sovereignty, encouraging localism, local markets and short supply chains, rejecting neoliberal globalisation, supporting smallholder agriculture and land reform while incentivising agroecological practices that build soil fertility, use and develop high-productive landraces and a focus on nutrition per acre rather than increased grain size, ‚Äòyield‚Äô and ‚Äòoutput‚Äô. That‚Äôs how you create healthy food, healthy people and healthy societies. The relationship between financial investment and the commodification of farmland is increasingly significant for understanding the dynamics of modern agriculture and its implications for food systems. Financial institutions, including pension funds and investment firms, have turned farmland into a lucrative asset class, helping to fuel a paradigm shift in agricultural practices. This financialisation of farmland not only affects the economic landscape, opening up fresh investment opportunities, but also perpetuates an industrial agricultural model that prioritises profit over sustainability, sound agricultural practices and public health. The commodification of farmland involves transforming land into a tradable commodity, which is driven by the interests of big financial entities seeking high returns on their investments. This financial pressure leads to the aggregation of land into larger, industrial-scale farms owned by corporations or investment funds, which tend to employ input-intensive farming practices that degrade soil health and reduce biodiversity. The influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of human health, ecological balance and a systems approach (more on this later). The shift towards large-scale intensive farming operations has also diminished the role of smallholder farmers, who have traditionally played a major role in local food security and rural economies, thereby undermining community resilience and exacerbating food insecurity. Between 2008 and 2022, land prices nearly doubled throughout the world and tripled in Central-Eastern Europe. In the UK, an influx of investment from pension funds and private wealth contributed to a doubling of farmland prices from 2010-2015. Land prices in the US agricultural heartlands of Iowa quadrupled between 2002 and 2020. . A wheat field in Essex (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Agricultural investment funds rose ten-fold between 2005 and 2018 and now regularly include farmland as a stand-alone asset class, with US investors having doubled their stakes in farmland since 2020. Meanwhile, agricultural commodity traders are speculating on farmland through their own private equity subsidiaries, while new financial derivatives are allowing speculators to accrue land parcels and lease them back to struggling farmers, driving steep and sustained land price inflation. Moreover, top-down ‚Äògreen grabs‚Äô now account for 20 per cent of large-scale land deals. Government pledges for land-based carbon removals alone add up to almost 1.2 billion hectares, equivalent to total global cropland. Carbon offset markets are expected to quadruple in the next seven years. These are some of the findings published in the report ‚ÄòLand Squeeze‚Äô (May 2024) by the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES), a non-profit thinktank headquartered in Brussels. The report says that agricultural land is increasingly being turned into a financial asset at the expense of small- and medium-scale farming, leading to land price inflation. Furthermore, the COVID-19 event and the conflict in Ukraine helped promote the ‚Äòfeed the world‚Äô panic narrative, prompting agribusiness and investors to secure land for export commodity production and urging governments to deregulate land markets and adopt pro-investor policies. However, despite sky-rocketing food prices, there was, according to the IPES in 2022, sufficient food and no risk of global food supply shortages. The increased food prices were due to speculation on food commodities, corporate profiteering and a heavy reliance on food imports. But the self-serving narrative pushed by big agribusiness and land investors prevailed. At the same time, carbon and biodiversity offset markets are facilitating massive land transactions, bringing major polluters into land markets. The IPES notes that Shell has set aside more than $450 million for carbon offsetting projects. Land is also being appropriated for biofuels and green energy production, including water-intensive ‚Äògreen hydrogen‚Äô projects that pose risks to local food cultivation. In addition, much-needed agricultural land is being repurposed for extractive industries and mega-developments. For example, urbanisation and mega-infrastructure developments in Asia and Africa are claiming prime farmland. According to the IPES, between 2000 and 2030, up to 3.3 million hectares of the world‚Äôs farmland will have been swallowed up by expanding megacities. Some 80 per cent of land loss to urbanisation is occurring in Asia and Africa. In India, 1.5 million hectares are estimated to have been lost to urban growth between 1955 and1985, a further 800,000 hectares lost between 1985 and 2000, with steady ongoing losses to this day. In a December 2016 paper on urban land expansion, it was projected that by 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland. Around 60 per cent of the world‚Äôs cropland lies on the outskirts of cities, and this land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. This means that, as cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are being displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in lower income countries and are key to global food security. In their place, as their land is concreted over, we are seeing the aggregation of remaining agricultural land into large-scale farms, land buy ups and further land investments and the spread of industrial agriculture and all it brings, including poor food and diets, illness, environmental devastation and the destruction of rural communities. Investment funds have no real interest in farming or ensuring food security. They tend to invest for between only 10 and 15 years and can leave a trail of long-term environmental and social devastation and serve to undermine local and regional food security. Short- to medium-term returns on investments trump any notions of healthy food or human need. The IPES notes that, globally, just 1 per cent of the world‚Äôs largest farms now control 70 per cent of the world‚Äôs farmland. These tend to be input-intensive, industrial-scale farms that are straining resources, rapidly degrading farmland and further squeezing out smallholders. Additionally, agribusiness giants are pursuing monopolistic practices that drive up costs for farmers. These dynamics are creating systematic economic precarity for farmers, effectively forcing them to ‚Äòget big or get out‚Äô. Factor in land degradation, much of which is attributable to modern chemical-intensive farming practices, and we have a recipe for global food insecurity. In India, more than 70 per cent of its arable land is affected by one or more forms of land degradation. Also consider that the Indian government has sanctioned 50 solar parks, covering one million hectares in seven states. More than 74 per cent of solar is on land of agricultural (67 per cent) or natural ecosystem value (7 per cent), causing potential food security and biodiversity conflicts. The IPES report notes that since 2017 there have been more than 15 instances of conflict in India linked with these projects. What is the impact of all this on farming and what might the future hold? Nettie Wiebe, from the IPES, explains: ‚ÄúImagine trying to start a farm when 70 per cent of farmland is already controlled by just 1 per cent of the largest farms ‚Äî and when land prices have risen for 20 years in a row, like in North America. That‚Äôs the stark reality young farmers face today. Farmland is increasingly owned not by farmers but by speculators, pension funds and big agribusinesses looking to cash in. Land prices have skyrocketed so high it‚Äôs becoming impossible to make a living from farming. This is reaching a tipping point ‚Äî small and medium scale farming is simply being squeezed out.‚Äù Susan Chomba, also from the IPES, says that soaring land prices and land grabs are driving an unprecedented ‚Äòland squeeze‚Äô, accelerating inequality and threatening food production. Moreover, the rush for dubious carbon projects, tree planting schemes, clean fuels and speculative buying is displacing not only small-scale farmers but also indigenous peoples. Huge swathes of farmland are being acquired by governments and corporations for these ‚Äògreen grabs‚Äô, despite little evidence of climate benefits. This issue is particularly affecting Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa. The IPES notes that some 25 million hectares of land have been snapped up for carbon projects by a single ‚Äòenvironmental asset creation‚Äô firm, UAE-based ‚ÄòBlue Carbon‚Äô, through agreements with the governments of Kenya, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and Liberia. According to the IPES, the ‚Äòland squeeze‚Äô is leading to farmer revolts, rural exodus, rural poverty and food insecurity. With global farmland prices having doubled in 15 years, farmers, peasants, and indigenous peoples are losing their land (or forced to downsize), while young farmers face significant barriers in accessing land to farm. The IPES calls for action to halt green grabs and remove speculative investment from land markets and establish integrated governance for land, environment and food systems to ensure a just transition. It also calls for support for collective ownership of farms and innovative financing for farmers to access land and wants a new deal for farmers and rural areas, and that includes a new generation of land and agrarian reforms. Capital accumulation based on the financialisation of farmland accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis. However, financialisation of the economy in general goes back to the 1970s and 1980s when we witnessed a deceleration of economic growth based on industrial production. The response was to compensate via financial capitalism and financial intermediation. Professor John Bellamy Foster, writing in 2010, not long after the 2008 crisis, stated: ‚ÄúLacking an outlet in production, capital took refuge in speculation in debt-leveraged finance (a bewildering array of options, futures, derivatives, swaps etc.).‚Äù The neoliberal agenda was the political expression of capital‚Äôs response to the stagnation and included the raiding and sacking of public budgets, the expansion of credit to consumers and governments to sustain spending and consumption and frenzied financial speculation. With the engine of capital accumulation via production no longer firing on all cylinders, the emergency backup of financial expansion took over. We have seen a shift from real capital formation in many Western economies, which increases overall economic output, towards the appreciation of financial assets, which increases wealth claims but not output. Farmland is being transformed from a resource supporting food production and rural stability to a financial asset and speculative commodity. An asset class where wealthy investors can park their capital to further profit from inflated asset prices. The net-zero green agenda also has to be seen in this context: when capital struggles to make sufficient profit, productive wealth (capital) over accumulates and depreciates; to avoid crisis, constant growth and, in this case, the creation of fresh ‚Äògreen‚Äô investment opportunities is required. The IPES report notes that nearly 45 per cent of all farmland investments in 2018, worth roughly $15 billion, came from pension funds and insurance companies. Based on workers‚Äô contributions, pension fund investments in farmland are promoting land speculation, industrial agriculture and the interests of big agribusiness at the expense of smallholder farmers. Workers‚Äô futures are tied to pension funds, which are supporting the growth and power of global finance and the degradation of other workers (in this case, cultivators). Sof√≠a Monsalve Su√°rez, from the IPES, states: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time decision-makers stop shirking their responsibility and start to tackle rural decline. The financialisation and liberalisation of land markets is ruining livelihoods and threatening the right to food. Instead of opening the floodgates to speculative capital, governments need to take concrete steps to halt bogus ‚Äògreen grabs‚Äô and invest in rural development, sustainable farming and community-led conservation.‚Äù With pensions tied to an increasingly commodified food system, ordinary people have become deeply incorporated into a capitalist economy that requires private profit at the expense of public well-being. The links between big finance, the food system, illness and big pharma were described in Sickening Profits: The Global Food System‚Äôs Poisoned Food and Toxic Wealth. That book highlighted a cyclical relationship where financial institutions like BlackRock benefit from both their investments in the global food system and their investments in pharmaceuticals. At the same time, the relationship between ordinary people‚Äôs pensions and investments and the commodification of farmland further illustrates a complex interplay between finance and agriculture. Addressing these challenges requires a critical examination of how financial interests shape agricultural practices and a concerted effort towards more sustainable food systems that prioritise ecological integrity and community well-being over mere profitability. Earlier in this chapter, it was stated that the influx of capital into farmland has further fuelled an industrial agricultural model characterised by monocultures, heavy reliance on chemical inputs and a focus on maximising yields at the expense of ecological balance and a systems approach. But what is a systems approach? It involves understanding agriculture as part of a broader ecological and social system. It acknowledges that agricultural practices affect and are affected by environmental health, community well-being and economic viability. However, industrial agriculture often overlooks these interconnections, leading to detrimental outcomes such as soil degradation, polluted waterways, loss of biodiversity, the destruction of rural communities, small-scale farms and local economies and negative health impacts. By contrast, a systems approach promotes agroecological principles that prioritise local food security, sustainable practices and the resilience of farming communities. Agroecology serves as a primary framework within this systems approach. It integrates scientific research with traditional knowledge and grassroots participation, fostering practices that enhance ecological balance while ensuring farmers‚Äô livelihoods. This method encourages diverse cropping systems, natural pest management and sustainable resource use, which collectively contribute to more resilient agricultural ecosystems. Agroecology not only addresses immediate agricultural challenges but also engages with broader political and economic issues affecting food systems. Moreover, a systems approach prioritises diverse nutrition production per acre, which contrasts sharply with conventional, reductionist agricultural models that focus predominantly on maximising yields of a single crop. Agroecological methods, which are foundational to this systems perspective, can lead to improved nutritional outcomes: by cultivating a wider variety of crops, farmers can enhance the nutritional quality of food produced on each acre, thereby addressing issues of malnutrition and food insecurity more effectively. Localised food systems and the primacy of small farms are critical to a systems approach. By reducing dependency on global supply chains dominated by big finance and large agribusiness, localised systems can enhance food sovereignty and empower communities. This shift not only mitigates vulnerability to global market fluctuations and supply chain crises but also fosters self-sufficiency and resilience against environmental changes. A systems approach thus advocates for policies that support smallholder farmers and promote sustainable practices tailored to local conditions. (For further insight into agroecology and its feasibility, successes and scaling up, there is an entire chapter on agroecology in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order.) Throughout the world, from the Netherlands to India, farmers are protesting. The protests might appear to have little in common. But they do. Farmers are increasingly finding it difficult to make a living, whether, for instance, because of neoliberal trade policies that lead to the import of produce that undermines domestic production and undercuts prices, the withdrawal of state support or the implementation of net-zero emissions policies that set unrealistic targets. The common thread is that, by one way or another, farming is deliberately being made impossible or financially non-viable. The aim is to drive most farmers off the land and ram through an agenda that by its very nature seems likely to produce shortages and undermine food security. . Farmers‚Äô protest in The Hague 1 October 2019. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0) . A ‚Äòone world agriculture‚Äô global agenda is being promoted by the likes of the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum. It involves a vision of food and farming that sees companies such as Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta and Cargill working with Microsoft, Google and the big-tech giants to facilitate AI-driven farmerless farms, laboratory-engineered ‚Äòfood‚Äô and retail dominated by the likes of Amazon and Walmart. A cartel of data owners, proprietary input suppliers and e-commerce platforms at the commanding heights of the economy. The agenda is the brainchild of a digital-corporate-financial complex that wants to transform and control all aspects of life and human behaviour. This complex forms part of an authoritarian global elite that has the ability to coordinate its agenda globally via the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other supranational organisations, including influential think tanks and foundations (Gates, Rockefeller etc.). Its agenda for food and farming is euphemistically called a ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô. Big agribusiness and ‚Äòphilanthropic‚Äô foundations position themselves as the saviours of humanity due to their much-promoted plans to ‚Äòfeed the world‚Äô with high-tech ‚Äòprecision‚Äô farming‚Äô, ‚Äòdata-driven‚Äô agriculture and ‚Äògreen‚Äô (net-zero) production ‚Äî with a warped notion of ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô being the mantra. A much talked about ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô goes hand in hand with an energy transition, net-zero ideology, programmable central bank digital currencies, the censorship of free speech and clampdowns on protest. To properly understand these processes, we need to first locate what is essentially a social and economic reset within the context of a collapsing financial system. Writer Ted Reece notes that the general rate of profit has trended downwards from an estimated 43 per cent in the 1870s to 17 per cent in the 2000s. By late 2019, many companies could not generate enough profit. Falling turnover, squeezed margins, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were prevalent. Professor Fabio Vighi of Cardiff University has described how closing down the global economy in early 2020 under the guise of fighting a supposedly new and novel pathogen allowed the US Federal Reserve to flood collapsing financial markets (COVID relief) with freshly printed money without causing hyperinflation. Lockdowns curtailed economic activity, thereby removing demand for the newly printed money (credit) in the physical economy and preventing ‚Äòcontagion‚Äô. According to investigative journalist Michael Byrant, ‚Ç¨1.5 trillion was needed to deal with the crisis in Europe alone. The financial collapse staring European central bankers in the face came to a head in 2019. The appearance of a ‚Äònovel virus‚Äô provided a convenient cover story. The European Central Bank agreed to a ‚Ç¨1.31 trillion bailout of banks followed by the EU agreeing to a ‚Ç¨750 billion recovery fund for European states and corporations. This package of long-term, ultra-cheap credit to hundreds of banks was sold to the public as a necessary programme to cushion the impact of the ‚Äòpandemic‚Äô on businesses and workers. In response to a collapsing neoliberalism, we are now seeing the rollout of an authoritarian great reset ‚Äî an agenda that intends to reshape the economy and change how we live. The new economy is to be dominated by a handful of tech giants, global conglomerates and e-commerce platforms, and new markets will also be created through the financialisation of nature, which is to be colonised, commodified and traded under the notion of protecting the environment. In recent years, we have witnessed an overaccumulation of capital, and the creation of such markets will provide fresh investment opportunities (including dodgy carbon offsetting Ponzi schemes) for the super-rich to park their wealth and prosper. This great reset envisages a transformation of Western societies, resulting in permanent restrictions on fundamental liberties and mass surveillance. Being rolled out under the benign term of a ‚ÄòFourth Industrial Revolution‚Äô, the World Economic Forum (WEF) says the public will eventually ‚Äòrent‚Äô everything they require (remember the WEF video ‚Äòyou will own nothing and be happy‚Äô?): stripping the right of ownership under the guise of a ‚Äògreen economy‚Äô and underpinned by the rhetoric of ‚Äòsustainable consumption‚Äô and ‚Äòclimate emergency‚Äô. . Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates ‚Äì World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008 (Copyright World Economic Forum by Remy Steinegger) . Climate alarmism and the mantra of sustainability are about promoting money-making schemes. But they also serve another purpose: social control. Neoliberalism has run its course, resulting in the impoverishment of large sections of the population. But to dampen dissent and lower expectations, the levels of personal freedom we have been used to will not be tolerated. This means that the wider population will be subjected to the discipline of an emerging surveillance state. To push back against any dissent, ordinary people are being told that they must sacrifice personal liberty in order to protect public health, societal security (those terrible Russians, Islamic extremists or that Sunak-designated bogeyman George Galloway) or the climate; in the case of the climate, this means, for instance, travelling less and eating synthetic ‚Äòmeat‚Äô. Unlike in the old normal of neoliberalism, an ideological shift is occurring whereby personal freedoms are increasingly depicted as being dangerous because they run counter to the collective good. A main reason for this ideological shift is to ensure that the masses get used to lower living standards and accept them. Consider, for instance, the Bank of England‚Äôs chief economist Huw Pill saying that people should ‚Äòaccept‚Äô being poorer. And then there is Rob Kapito of the world‚Äôs biggest asset management firm BlackRock, who says that a ‚Äúvery entitled‚Äù generation must deal with scarcity for the first time in their lives. At the same time, to muddy the waters, the message is that lower living standards are the result of the conflict in Ukraine and supply shocks that both the war and ‚Äòthe virus‚Äô have caused. The net-zero carbon emissions agenda will help legitimise lower living standards (reducing your carbon footprint) while reinforcing the notion that our rights must be sacrificed for the greater good. You will own nothing, not because the rich and their neoliberal agenda made you poor but because you will be instructed to stop being irresponsible and must act to protect the planet. But what of this shift towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and the plan to slash our carbon footprints? Is it even feasible or necessary? Gordon Hughes, a former World Bank economist and current professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, says in a 2024 report that current UK and European net-zero policies will likely lead to further economic ruin. Apparently, the only viable way to raise the cash for sufficient new capital expenditure (on wind and solar infrastructure) would be a two decades-long reduction in private consumption of up to 10 per cent. Such a shock has never occurred in the last century outside war; even then, never for more than a decade. But this agenda will also cause serious environmental degradation. So says Andrew Nikiforuk in the article The Rising Chorus of Renewable Energy Skeptics, which outlines how the green techno-dream is vastly destructive. He lists the devastating environmental impacts of an even more mineral-intensive system based on renewables and warns: ‚ÄúThe whole process of replacing a declining system with a more complex mining-based enterprise is now supposed to take place with a fragile banking system, dysfunctional democracies, broken supply chains, critical mineral shortages and hostile geopolitics.‚Äù All of this assumes that global warming is real and anthropogenic. Not everyone agrees. In the article Global warming and the confrontation between the West and the rest of the world, journalist Thierry Meyssan argues that net zero is based on political ideology rather than science. But to state such things has become heresy in the Western countries and shouted down with accusations of ‚Äòclimate science denial‚Äô. Regardless of such concerns, the march towards net zero continues, and key to this is the United Nations Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development Goals. . A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid (Licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0) . Today, almost every business or corporate report, website or brochure includes a multitude of references to ‚Äòcarbon footprints‚Äô, ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô, ‚Äònet zero‚Äô or ‚Äòclimate neutrality‚Äô and how a company or organisation intends to achieve its sustainability targets. Green profiling, green bonds and green investments go hand in hand with displaying ‚Äògreen‚Äô credentials and ambitions wherever and whenever possible. It seems anyone and everyone in business is planting their corporate flag on the summit of sustainability. Take Sainsbury‚Äôs, for instance. It is one of the ‚Äòbig six‚Äô food retail supermarkets in the UK and has a vision for the future of food that it published in 2019 that dovetails with the so-called food transition and the interrelated net-zero agenda ‚Äî you must change your eating habits and eat synthetic food to save the planet! Here‚Äôs a quote from it: ‚ÄúPersonalised Optimisation is a trend that could see people chipped and connected like never before. A significant step on from wearable tech used today, the advent of personal microchips and neural laces has the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms which could work out exactly what we need to support us at a particular time in our life. Retailers, such as Sainsbury‚Äôs could play a critical role to support this, arranging delivery of the needed food within thirty minutes ‚Äî perhaps by drone.‚Äù Tracked, traced and chipped ‚Äî for your own benefit. Corporations accessing all of our personal data, right down to our DNA. The report is littered with references to sustainability and the climate or environment, and it is difficult not to get the impression that it is written so as to leave the reader awestruck by the technological possibilities. We shall return to this report in the next chapter. The report appears to be part of a paradigm that promotes a brave new world of technological innovation but has nothing to say about power ‚Äî who determines policies that have led to massive inequalities, poverty, malnutrition, food insecurity and hunger and who is responsible for the degradation of the environment in the first place ‚Äî is nothing new. The essence of power is conveniently glossed over, not least because those involved in the prevailing food regime are also shaping the techno-utopian fairytale where everyone lives happily ever after eating synthetic food while living in a digital panopticon. The type of ‚Äògreen‚Äô agenda being pushed is not just about social engineering and behavioural change; it is also a multi-trillion market opportunity for lining the pockets of rich investors and subsidy-sucking green infrastructure firms. It is, furthermore, a type of green that plans to cover much of the countryside with wind farms and solar panels with most farmers no longer farming. A recipe for food insecurity. Those investing in the ‚Äògreen‚Äô agenda care first and foremost about profit. The supremely influential BlackRock is not only promoting this agenda; it also invests in the current food system and the corporations responsible for polluted waterways, degraded soils, the displacement of smallholder farmers, a spiralling public health crisis, malnutrition and much more. It also invests in healthcare ‚Äî an industry that thrives on the illnesses and conditions created by eating the substandard food that the current system produces. Did Larry Fink, the top man at BlackRock, suddenly develop a conscience and become an environmentalist who cares about the planet and ordinary people? Of course not. He smells ever more profit in ‚Äòclimate-friendly‚Äô, ‚Äòprecision‚Äô agriculture, genetic engineering and facilitating a new technocratic fake-green normal. Any serious deliberations on the future of food would surely consider issues like food sovereignty, the role of agroecology and the strengthening of family farms ‚Äî the backbone of current global food production. The aforementioned article by Andrew Nikiforuk concludes that, if we are really serious about our impacts on the environment, we must scale back our needs and simplify society. In terms of food, the solution rests on a low-input approach that strengthens rural communities and local markets and prioritises smallholder farms and small independent enterprises and retailers, localised democratic food systems and a concept of food sovereignty based on self-sufficiency, agroecological principles and regenerative agriculture. It would involve facilitating the right to culturally appropriate food that is nutritionally dense due to diverse cropping patterns and free from toxic chemicals while ensuring local ownership and stewardship of common resources like land, water, soil and seeds. That‚Äôs where genuine environmentalism, ‚Äòsustainability‚Äô, social justice and the future of food begins. But there‚Äôs no profit or role in that for Fink or the big agribusiness and tech giants that despise such approaches. Sainsbury‚Äôs Future of Food report (2019), mentioned in the previous chapter, is not merely a misguided attempt at forecasting future trends and habits; it reads more like a manifesto for corporate control and technocratic tyranny disguised as ‚Äòprogress‚Äô. This document epitomises everything wrong with the industrial food system‚Äôs vision for our future. It represents a dystopian roadmap to a world where our most fundamental connection to nature and culture ‚Äî our food ‚Äî is hijacked by corporate interests and mediated through a maze of unnecessary and potentially harmful technologies. . Illustration by Margarita Mitrovic / Screenshot from Sainsbury‚Äôs Report . The wild predictions and technological ‚Äòsolutions‚Äô presented in the report reveal a profound disconnection from the lived experiences of ordinary people and the real challenges facing our food systems. Its claim (in 2019) that a quarter of Britons will be vegetarian by 2025 seems way off the mark. But it fits a narrative that seeks to reshape our diets and food culture. Once you convince the reader that things are going to be a certain way in the future, it is easier to pave the way for normalising what appears elsewhere in the report: lab-grown meat, 3D-printed foods and space farming. Of course, the underlying assumption is that giant corporations ‚Äî and supermarkets like Sainsbury‚Äôs ‚Äî will be controlling everything and rolling out marvellous ‚Äòinnovations‚Äô under the guise of ‚Äòfeeding the world‚Äô or ‚Äòsaving the planet‚Äô. There is no concern expressed in the report about the consolidation of corporate-technocratic control over the food system. By promoting high-tech solutions, the report seemingly advocates for a future where our food supply is entirely dependent on complex technologies controlled by a handful of corporations. The report talks of ‚Äòartisan factories‚Äô run by robots. Is this meant to get ordinary people to buy into Sainsbury‚Äôs vision of the future? Possibly, if the intention is to further alienate people from their food sources, making them ever more dependent on corporate-controlled, ultra-processed products. It‚Äôs a future where the art of cooking, the joy of growing food and the cultural significance of traditional dishes are replaced by sterile, automated processes devoid of human touch and cultural meaning. This erosion of food culture and skills is not an unintended consequence ‚Äî it‚Äôs a core feature of the corporate food system‚Äôs strategy to create a captive market of consumers unable to feed themselves without corporate intervention. The report‚Äôs enthusiasm for personalised nutrition driven by AI and biometric data is akin to an Orwellian scenario that would give corporations unprecedented control over our dietary choices, turning the most fundamental human need into a data-mined, algorithm-driven commodity. The privacy implications are staggering, as is the potential for new forms of discrimination and social control based on eating habits. Imagine a world where your insurance premiums are tied to your adherence to a corporate-prescribed diet or where your employment prospects are influenced by your ‚ÄòFood ID‚Äô. The possible dystopian reality lurking behind Sainsbury‚Äôs glossy predictions. The report‚Äôs fixation on exotic ingredients like jellyfish and lichen draws attention away from the real issues affecting our food systems ‚Äî corporate concentration, environmental degradation and the systematic destruction of local food cultures and economies. It would be better to address the root causes of food insecurity and malnutrition, which are fundamentally issues of poverty and inequality, not a lack of novel food sources. Nothing is mentioned about the vital role of agroecology, traditional farming knowledge and food sovereignty in creating truly sustainable and just food systems. Instead, what we see is a future where every aspect of our diet is mediated by technology and corporate interests, from gene-edited crops to synthetic biology-derived foods. A direct assault on the principles of food sovereignty, which assert the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods. The report‚Äôs emphasis on lab-grown meat and other high-tech protein sources is particularly troubling. These technologies, far from being the environmental saviours they are promoted as, risk increasing energy use and further centralising food production in the hands of a few tech giants. The massive energy requirements for large-scale cultured meat production are conveniently glossed over, as are the potential health risks of consuming these novel foods without long-term safety studies. This push for synthetic foods is not about sustainability or animal welfare ‚Äî it‚Äôs about creating new, patentable food sources that can be controlled and monetised by corporations. Moreover, the push for synthetic foods and ‚Äòprecision fermentation‚Äô threatens to destroy the livelihoods of millions of small farmers and pastoralists worldwide, replacing them with a handful of high-tech facilities controlled by multinational corporations. Is this meant to be ‚Äòprogress‚Äô? It‚Äôs more like a boardroom recipe for increased food insecurity, rural poverty and corporate monopolisation. The destruction of traditional farming communities and practices would not only be an economic disaster but a cultural catastrophe, erasing millennia of accumulated knowledge and wisdom about sustainable food production. The report‚Äôs casual mention of ‚Äòsin taxes‚Äô on meat signals a future where our dietary choices are increasingly policed and penalised by the state, likely at the behest of corporate interests. However, on the issue of the need to reduce meat consumption and replace meat with laboratory-manufactured items in order to reduce carbon emissions, it must be stated that the dramatic increase in the amount of meat consumed post-1945 was not necessarily the result of consumer preference; it had more to do with political policy, the mechanisation of agriculture and Green Revolution practices. That much was made clear by Laila Kassam, who, in her 2017 article What‚Äôs grain got to do with it? How the problem of surplus grain was solved by increasing ‚Äòmeat‚Äô consumption in post-WWII US, asked: ‚ÄúHave you ever wondered how ‚Äòmeat‚Äô became such a central part of the Western diet? Or how the industrialisation of ‚Äòanimal agriculture‚Äô came about? It might seem like the natural outcome of the ‚Äòfree market‚Äô meeting demand for more ‚Äòmeat‚Äô. But from what I have learned from Nibert (2002) and Winders and Nibert (2004), the story of how ‚Äòmeat‚Äô consumption increased so much in the post-World War II period is anything but natural. They argue it is largely due to a decision in the 1940s by the US government to deal with the problem of surplus grain by increasing the production of ‚Äòmeat‚Äô.‚Äù Kassam notes: ‚ÄúIn the second half of the 20th century, global ‚Äòmeat‚Äô production increased by nearly 5 times. The amount of ‚Äòmeat‚Äô eaten per person doubled. By 2050 ‚Äòmeat‚Äô consumption is estimated to increase by 160 percent (The World Counts, 2017). While global per capita ‚Äòmeat‚Äô consumption is currently 43 kg/year, it is nearly double in the UK (82 kg/year) and almost triple in the US (118 kg/year).‚Äù Kassam notes that habits and desires are manipulated by elite groups for their own interests. Propaganda, advertising and ‚Äòpublic relations‚Äô are used to manufacture demand for products. Agribusiness corporations and the state have used these techniques to encourage ‚Äòmeat‚Äô consumption, leading to the slaughter and untold misery of billions of creatures, as Kassam makes clear. People were manipulated to buy into ‚Äòmeat culture‚Äô. Now they are being manipulated to buy out, again by elite groups. But ‚Äòsin taxes‚Äô and Orwellian-type controls on individual behaviour are not the way to go about reducing meat consumption. So, what is the answer? Kassam says that one way to do this is to support grassroots organisations and movements which are working to resist the power of global agribusiness and reclaim our food systems. Movements for food justice and food sovereignty which promote sustainable, agroecological production systems. At least then people will be free from corporate manipulation and better placed to make their own food choices. As Kassam says: ‚ÄúFrom what I have learned so far, our oppression of other animals is not just a result of individual choices. It is underpinned by a state supported economic system driven by profit.‚Äù Meanwhile, Sainsbury‚Äôs vision of food production in space and on other planets is perhaps the most egregious example of misplaced priorities. While around a billion struggle with hunger and malnutrition and many more with micronutrient deficiencies, corporate futurists are fantasising about growing food on Mars. Is this supposed to be visionary thinking? It‚Äôs a perfect encapsulation of the technocratic mindset that believes every problem can be solved with more technology, no matter how impractical or divorced from reality. Moreover, by promoting a future dependent on complex, centralised technologies, we become increasingly vulnerable to system failures and corporate monopolies. A truly resilient food system should be decentralised, diverse and rooted in local knowledge and resources. The report‚Äôs emphasis on nutrient delivery through implants, patches and intravenous methods is particularly disturbing. This represents the ultimate commodification of nutrition, reducing food to mere fuel and stripping away all cultural, social and sensory aspects of eating. It‚Äôs a vision that treats the human body as a machine to be optimised, rather than a living being with complex needs and experiences. The idea of ‚Äògrow-your-own‚Äô ingredients for cultured meat and other synthetic foods at home is another example of how this technocratic vision co-opts and perverts concepts of self-sufficiency and local food production. Instead of encouraging people to grow real, whole foods, it proposes a dystopian parody of home food production that still keeps consumers dependent on corporate-supplied technologies and inputs. A clever marketing ploy to make synthetic foods seem more natural and acceptable. The report‚Äôs predictions about AI-driven personal nutrition advisors and highly customised diets based on individual ‚ÄòFood IDs‚Äô raise serious privacy concerns and threaten to further medicalise our relationship with food. While personalised nutrition could offer some benefits, the level of data collection and analysis required for such systems could lead to unprecedented corporate control over our dietary choices. Furthermore, the emphasis on ‚Äòartisan‚Äô factories run by robots completely misunderstands the nature of artisanal food production. True artisanal foods are the product of human skill, creativity and cultural knowledge passed down through generations. It‚Äôs a perfect example of how the technocratic mindset reduces everything to mere processes that can be automated, ignoring the human and cultural elements that give food its true value. The report‚Äôs vision of meat ‚Äòassembled‚Äô on 3D printing belts is another disturbing example of the ultra-processed future being proposed. This approach to food production treats nutrition as a mere assembly of nutrients, ignoring the complex interactions between whole foods and the human body. It‚Äôs a continuation of the reductionist thinking that has led to the current epidemic of diet-related diseases. Sainsbury‚Äôs is essentially advocating for a future where our diets are even further removed from natural, whole foods. The concept of ‚Äòfarms‚Äô cultivating plants to make growth serum for cells is yet another step towards the complete artificialisation of the food supply. This approach further distances food production from natural processes. It‚Äôs a vision of farming that has more in common with pharmaceutical production than traditional agriculture, and it threatens to complete the transformation of food from a natural resource into an industrial product. Sainsbury‚Äôs apparent enthusiasm for gene-edited and synthetic biology-derived foods is also concerning. These technologies‚Äô rapid adoption without thorough long-term safety studies and public debate could lead to unforeseen health and environmental impacts. The history of agricultural biotechnology is rife with examples of unintended consequences, from the development of herbicide-resistant superweeds to the contamination of non-GM crops. Is Sainsbury‚Äôs uncritically promoting these technologies, disregarding the precautionary principle? Issues like food insecurity, malnutrition and environmental degradation are not primarily technical problems ‚Äî they are the result of inequitable distribution of resources, exploitative economic systems and misguided policies. By framing these issues as purely technological challenges, Sainsbury‚Äôs is diverting attention from the need for systemic change and social justice in the food system. The high-tech solutions proposed are likely to be accessible only to the wealthy, at least initially, creating a two-tiered food system where the rich have access to ‚Äòoptimized‚Äô nutrition while the poor are left with increasingly degraded and processed options. But the report‚Äôs apparent disregard for the cultural and social aspects of food is perhaps its most fundamental flaw. Food is not merely fuel for our bodies; it‚Äôs a central part of our cultural identities, social relationships and connection to the natural world. By reducing food to a series of nutrients to be optimised and delivered in the most efficient manner possible, Sainsbury‚Äôs is proposing a future that is not only less healthy but less human. While Sainsbury‚Äôs Future of Food report can be regarded as a roadmap to a better future, it is really a corporate wish list, representing a dangerous consolidation of power in the hands of agribusiness giants and tech companies at the expense of farmers, consumers and the environment. The report is symptomatic of a wider ideology that seeks to legitimise total corporate control over our food supply. And the result? A homogenised, tech-driven dystopia. A technocratic nightmare that gives no regard for implementing food systems that are truly democratic, ecologically sound and rooted in the needs and knowledge of local communities. The real future of food lies not in corporate labs and AI algorithms, but in the fields of agroecological farmers, the kitchens of home cooks and the markets of local food producers. The path forward is not through more technology and corporate control but through a return to the principles of agroecology, food sovereignty and cultural diversity. ‚ÄúA total demolition of the previous forms of existence is underway: how one comes into the world, biological sex, education, relationships, the family, even the diet that is about to become synthetic.‚Äù ‚Äî Silvia Guerini, radical ecologist, in From the ‚ÄòNeutral‚Äô Body to the Posthuman Cyborg (2023) We are currently seeing an acceleration of the corporate consolidation of the entire global agri-food chain. The big data conglomerates, including Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook and Google, have joined traditional agribusiness giants, such as Corteva, Bayer, Cargill and Syngenta, in a quest to impose their model of food and agriculture on the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and big financial institutions, like BlackRock and Vanguard, are also involved, whether through buying up huge tracts of farmland, pushing biosynthetic (fake) food and genetic engineering technologies or more generally facilitating and financing the aims of the mega agri-food corporations. The billionaire interests behind this try to portray their techno-solutionism as some kind of humanitarian endeavour: saving the planet with ‚Äòclimate-friendly solutions‚Äô, ‚Äòhelping farmers‚Äô or ‚Äòfeeding the world‚Äô. But what it really amounts to is repackaging and greenwashing the dispossessive strategies of imperialism. It involves a shift towards a ‚Äòone world agriculture‚Äô under the control of agritech and the data giants, which is to be based on genetically-engineered seeds, laboratory-created products that resemble food, ‚Äòprecision‚Äô and ‚Äòdata-driven‚Äô agriculture and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail, being governed by monopolistic e-commerce platforms determined by artificial intelligence systems and algorithms. Those who are pushing this agenda have a vision not only for farmers but also for humanity in general. The elites through their military-digital-financial (Pentagon/Silicon Valley/Big Finance) complex want to use their technologies to reshape the world and redefine what it means to be human. They regard humans, their cultures and their practices, like nature itself, as a problem and deficient. Farmers are to be displaced and replaced with drones, machines and cloud-based computing. Food is to be redefined, and people are to be fed synthetic, genetically-engineered products. Cultures are to be eradicated, and humanity is to be fully urbanised, subservient and disconnected from the natural world. What it means to be human is to be radically transformed. But what has it meant to be human until now or at least prior to the (relatively recent) Industrial Revolution and associated mass urbanisation? To answer this question, we need to discuss our connection to nature and what most of humanity was involved in prior to industrialisation ‚Äî cultivating food. Many of the ancient rituals and celebrations of our forebears were built around stories, myths and rituals that helped them come to terms with some of the most fundamental issues of existence, from death to rebirth and fertility. These culturally-embedded beliefs and practices served to sanctify people‚Äôs practical relationship with nature and its role in sustaining human life. As agriculture became key to human survival, the planting and harvesting of crops and other seasonal activities associated with food production were central to these customs. Humans celebrated nature and the life it gave birth to. Ancient beliefs and rituals were imbued with hope and renewal and people had a necessary and immediate relationship with the sun, seeds, animals, wind, fire, soil and rain and the changing seasons that nourished and brought life. Our cultural and social relationships with agrarian production and associated deities had a sound practical base. People‚Äôs lives have been tied to planting, harvesting, seeds, soil and the seasons for thousands of years. Silvia Guerini, whose quote introduces this chapter, notes the importance of deep-rooted relationships and the rituals that re-affirm them. She says that through rituals a community recognises itself and its place in the world. They create the spirit of a rooted community by contributing to rooting and making a single existence endure in a time, in a territory, in a community. Professor Robert W Nicholls explains that the cults of Woden and Thor were superimposed on far older and better-rooted beliefs related to the sun and the earth, the crops and the animals and the rotation of the seasons between the light and warmth of summer and the cold and dark of winter. Humanity‚Äôs relationship with farming and food and our connections to land, nature and community has for millennia defined what it means to be human. Take India, for example. Environmental scientist Viva Kermani says that Hinduism is the world‚Äôs largest nature-based religion that: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ recognises and seeks the Divine in nature and acknowledges everything as sacred. It views the earth as our Mother and hence advocates that it should not be exploited. A loss of this understanding that earth is our mother, or rather a deliberate ignorance of this, has resulted in the abuse and the exploitation of the earth and its resources.‚Äù Kermani notes that ancient scriptures instructed people that the animals and plants found in India are sacred and, therefore, all aspects of nature are to be revered. She adds that this understanding of and reverence towards the environment is common to all Indic religious and spiritual systems: Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. According to Kermani, the Vedic deities have deep symbolism and many layers of existence. One such association is with ecology. Surya is associated with the sun, the source of heat and light that nourishes everyone; Indra is associated with rain, crops, and abundance; and Agni is the deity of fire and transformation and controls all changes. She notes that the Vrikshayurveda, an ancient Sanskrit text on the science of plants and trees, contains details about soil conservation, planting, sowing, treatment, propagating, how to deal with pests and diseases and a lot more. Like Nicholls, Kermani provides insight into some of the profound cultural, philosophical and practical aspects of humanity‚Äôs connection to nature and food production. This connection resonates with agrarianism, a philosophy based on cooperative labour and fellowship, which stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of urban life, capitalism and technology that are too often detrimental to independence and dignity. Agrarianism, too, emphasises a spiritual dimension as well as the value of rural society, small farms, widespread property ownership and political decentralisation. The poet and prominent proponent of agrarianism Wendell Berry says: ‚ÄúThe revolution which began with machines and chemicals now continues with automation, computers and biotechnology.‚Äù For Berry, agrarianism is not a sentimental longing for a time past. Colonial attitudes, domestic, foreign and now global, have resisted true agrarianism almost from the beginning ‚Äî there has never been fully sustainable, stable, locally adapted, land-based economies. However, Berry provides many examples of small (and larger) farms that have similar output as industrial agriculture with one third of the energy. In his poem ‚ÄòA Spiritual Journey‚Äô, Berry writes the following: ‚ÄúAnd the world cannot be discovered by a journey of miles, no matter how long, but only by a spiritual journey, a journey of one inch, very arduous and humbling and joyful, by which we arrive at the ground at our feet, and learn to be at home.‚Äù Agrarianism, while advocating for a return to small-scale farming and community-oriented living, is often critiqued for its idealisation of rural life and agricultural work. Critics argue that it mistakenly elevates farming above other forms of labour, suggesting that agricultural work inherently fosters moral virtues and a closer relationship with nature. It might appear to be naive, not least because, it overlooks the complexities and ethical dilemmas present in agrarian communities, which can be just as susceptible to corruption and environmental degradation as urban settings. This raises the question: are solutions based on agrarianism utopian and disconnected from modern societal needs? Not really. Agrarianism offers a necessary critique of industrial agriculture and the accelerated urbanisation we see across the world, emphasising the importance of local communities and sustainable practices. It promotes the idea that close relationships with the land can foster not only environmental stewardship but also social cohesion and moral integrity among community members. By advocating for small-scale farming and local food systems, agrarianism seeks to empower individuals and families, encouraging self-sufficiency and resilience against the negative impacts of globalisation and corporate control in agriculture. As a philosophy, agrarianism highlights the value of traditional knowledge and practices in addressing contemporary issues such as climate challenges, food security and social inequality. We shall return to Wendell Berry in the final chapter. But in the cold, centralised, technocratic dystopia that is planned, humanity‚Äôs spiritual connection to the countryside, food and agrarian production are to be cast into the dustbin of history. What we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people. Silvia Guerini says: ‚ÄúThe past becomes something to be erased in order to break the thread that binds us to a history, to a tradition, to a belonging, for the transition towards a new uprooted humanity, without past, without memory‚Ä¶ a new humanity dehumanised in its essence, totally in the hands of the manipulators of reality and truth‚Äù. This dehumanised humanity severed from the past is part of the wider agenda of transhumanism. For instance, we are not just seeing a push towards a world without farmers and everything that has connected us to the soil but, according to Guerini, also a world without mothers. She argues that those behind test-tube babies and surrogate motherhood now have their sights on genetic engineering and artificial wombs, which would cut women out of the reproductive process. Guerini predicts that artificial wombs could eventually be demanded, or rather marketed, as a right for everyone, including transgender people. It is interesting that the language around pregnancy is already contested with the omission of ‚Äòwomen‚Äô from statements like ‚Äòpersons who can get pregnant‚Äô. Of course, there has long been a blurring of lines between biotechnology, eugenics and genetic engineering. Genetically engineered crops, gene drives and gene editing are now a reality, but the ultimate goal is marrying artificial intelligence, bionanotechnology and genetic engineering to produce the one-world transhuman. This is being pushed by powerful interests, who, according to Guerini, are using a rainbow, transgenic left and LGBTQ+ organisations to promote a new synthetic identity and claim to new rights. She says this is an attack on life, on nature, on ‚Äúwhat is born, as opposed to artificial‚Äù and adds that all ties to the real, natural world must be severed. It is interesting that in its report Future of Food, the UK supermarket giant Sainsbury‚Äôs celebrates a future where we are microchipped and tracked and neural laces have the potential to see all of our genetic, health and situational data recorded, stored and analysed by algorithms that could work out exactly what food (delivered by drone) we need to support us at a particular time in our life. All sold as ‚Äòpersonal optimisation‚Äô. Moreover, it is likely, according to the report, that we will be getting key nutrients through implants. Part of these nutrients will come in the form of lab-grown food and insects. A neural lace is an ultra-thin mesh that can be implanted in the skull, forming a collection of electrodes capable of monitoring brain function. It creates an interface between the brain and the machine. Sainsbury‚Äôs does a pretty good job of trying to promote a dystopian future where AI has taken your job, but, according to the report, you have lots of time to celebrate the wonderful, warped world of ‚Äòfood culture‚Äô created by the supermarket and your digital overlords. Technofeudalism meets transhumanism ‚Äî all for your convenience, of course. Imagine, as you sit all day unemployed in your high-rise, your ‚Äòfood‚Äô will be delivered via an online platform bought courtesy of your programmable universal basic income digital money. Food courtesy of Gates-promoted farms manned by driverless machines, monitored by drones and doused with chemicals to produce crops from patented genetically modified seeds for industrial ‚Äòbiomatter‚Äô to be engineered, processed and constituted into something resembling food. Enjoy and be happy eating your fake food, stripped of satisfying productive endeavour and genuine self-fulfilment. But really, it will not be a problem. You can sit all day and exist virtually in Zuckerberg‚Äôs fantasy metaverse. Property-less and happy in your open prison of state dependency, track and chip surveillance passports and financial exclusion via programmable currency. A world also in which bodily integrity no longer exists courtesy of a mandatory vaccination agenda linked to emerging digital-biopharmaceutical technologies. But none of this will happen overnight. And whether the technology will deliver remains to be seen. Those who are promoting this brave new world might have overplayed their hand but will spend the following decades trying to drive their vision forward. But arrogance is their Achilles heel. There is still time to educate, to organise, to resist and to agitate against this hubris, not least by challenging the industrial food giants and the system that sustains them and by advocating for and creating grass-root food movements and local economies that strengthen food sovereignty. Max Weber (1864-1920) was a prominent German sociologist who developed influential theories on rationality and authority. He examined the different types of rationality that underpinned systems of authority. He argued that modern Western societies were based on legal-rational authority and had moved away from systems that were based on traditional authority and charismatic authority. Traditional authority derives its power from long-standing customs and traditions, while charismatic authority is based on the exceptional personal qualities or charisma of a leader. According to Weber, the legal-rational authority that characterises Western capitalist industrial society is based on instrumental rationality that focuses on the most efficient means to achieve given ends. This type of rationality manifests in bureaucratic power. Weber contrasted this with another form of rationality: value rationality that is based on conscious beliefs in the inherent value of certain behaviour. While Weber saw the benefits of instrumental rationality in terms of increased efficiency, he feared that this could lead to a stifling ‚Äúiron cage‚Äù of a rule-based order and rule following (instrumental rationality) as an end in itself. The result would be humanity‚Äôs ‚Äúpolar night of icy darkness.‚Äù Today, technological change is sweeping across the planet and presents many challenges. The danger is of a technological iron cage in the hands of an elite that uses technology for malevolent purposes. Lewis Coyne of Exeter University says: ‚ÄúWe do not ‚Äî or should not ‚Äî want to become a society in which things of deeper significance are appreciated only for any instrumental value. The challenge, therefore, is to delimit instrumental rationality and the technologies that embody it by protecting that which we value intrinsically, above and beyond mere utility.‚Äù He adds that we must decide which technologies we are for, to what ends, and how they can be democratically managed, with a view to the kind of society we wish to be. A major change that we have seen in recent years is the increasing dominance of cloud-based services and platforms. In the food and agriculture sector, we are seeing the rollout of these phenomena tied to a techno solutionist ‚Äòdata-driven‚Äô or ‚Äòprecision‚Äô agriculture legitimised by ‚Äòhumanitarian‚Äô notions of ‚Äòhelping farmers‚Äô, ‚Äòsaving the planet‚Äô and ‚Äòfeeding the world‚Äô in the face of some kind of impending Malthusian catastrophe. A part-fear mongering, part-self-aggrandisement narrative promoted by those who have fuelled ecological devastation, corporate dependency, land dispossession, food insecurity and farmer indebtedness as a result of the global food regime that they helped to create and profited from. Now, with a highly profitable but flawed carbon credit trading scheme and a greenwashed technology-driven eco-modernism, they are supposedly going to save humanity from itself. In the agrifood sector, we are seeing the rollout of data-driven or precision approaches to agriculture by the likes of Microsoft, Syngenta, Bayer and Amazon centred on cloud-based data information services. Data-driven agriculture mines data to be exploited by the agribusiness/big tech giants to instruct farmers what and how much to produce and what type of proprietary inputs they must purchase and from whom. Data owners (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta, Cargill etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon, Walmart etc) aim to secure the commanding heights of the global agrifood economy through their monopolistic platforms. But what does this model of agriculture look like in practice? Let us use Bayer‚Äôs digital platform Climate FieldView as an example. It collects data from satellites and sensors in fields and on tractors and then uses algorithms to advise farmers on their farming practices: when and what to plant, how much pesticide to spray, how much fertiliser to apply etc. To be part of Bayer‚Äôs Carbon Program, farmers have to be enrolled in FieldView. Bayer then uses the FieldView app to instruct farmers on the implementation of just two practices that are said to sequester carbon in the soils: reduced tillage or no-till farming and the planting of cover crops. Through the app, the company monitors these two practices and estimates the amount of carbon that the participating farmers have sequestered. Farmers are then supposed to be paid according to Bayer‚Äôs calculations, and Bayer uses that information to claim carbon credits and sell these in carbon markets. Bayer also has a programme in the US called ForGround. Upstream companies can use the platform to advertise and offer discounts for equipment, seeds and other inputs. For example, getting more farmers to use reduced tillage or no-till is of huge benefit to Bayer (sold on the basis of it being ‚Äòclimate friendly‚Äô as it keeps carbon in the soil). The kind of reduced tillage or no-till promoted by Bayer requires dousing fields with its RoundUp (toxic glyphosate) or some other toxic herbicide and planting seeds of its genetically engineered herbicide tolerant soybeans or hybrid maize. And what of the cover crops referred to above? Bayer also intends to profit from the promotion of cover crops. It has taken majority ownership of a seed company developing a gene-edited cover crop, called CoverCress. Seeds of CoverCress will be sold to farmers who are enrolled in ForGround and the crop will be sold as a biofuel. But Bayer‚Äôs big target is the downstream food companies which can use the platform to claim emissions reductions in their supply chains. Agribusiness corporations and the big tech companies are jointly developing carbon farming platforms to influence farmers on their choice of inputs and farming practices (big tech companies, like Microsoft and IBM, are major buyers of carbon credits). The non-profit GRAIN says (see the article The corporate agenda behind carbon farming) that Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN argues that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. Digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the data harvested from the participating farms. Yanis Varoufakis, former finance minister of Greece, argues that what we are seeing is a shift from capitalism to techno-feudalism. He argues that tech giants like Apple, Meta and Amazon act as modern-day feudal lords. Users of digital platforms (such as companies or farmers) essentially become ‚Äòcloud serfs‚Äô, and ‚Äòrent‚Äô (fees, data etc) is extracted from them for being on a platform. In feudalism (land) rent drives the system. In capitalism, profits drive the system. Varoufakis says that markets are being replaced by algorithmic ‚Äòdigital fiefdoms‚Äô. Although digital platforms require some form of capitalist production, as companies like Amazon or Bayer need manufacturers or farmers to produce goods for their platforms, the new system represents a significant shift in power dynamics, favouring those who own and control the platforms. Whether this system is technofeudalism, hypercapitalism or something else is open to debate. But we should at least be able to agree on one thing: the changes we are seeing are having profound impacts on economies as well as producers and populations that are increasingly surveilled as they are compelled to shift their activities and lives online. The very corporations that are responsible for the problems of the prevailing food system merely offer more of the same, this time packaged in an app-friendly, genetically engineered, ecomodernist, fake-green, carbon-trading wrapping. Elected officials are facilitating this by putting the needs of monopolistic global interests ahead of ordinary people‚Äôs personal freedoms and workers‚Äô rights, as well as the needs of independent local producers, enterprises and markets. For instance, the Indian government has in recent times signed memoranda of understanding (MoU) with Amazon, Bayer, Microsoft and Syngenta to rollout data-driven, precision agriculture. Integral to A standardised ‚Äòone world agriculture‚Äô under the control of these companies based on genetically engineered seeds, laboratory created products that resemble food and farming without farmers, with the entire agrifood chain, from field (or lab) to retail in their hands. In response, a ‚Äòcitizen letter‚Äô (July 2024) was sent to the government. It stated that it is not clear what the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR. The letter raises some key concerns. Where is the democratic debate on carbon credit markets? Is the ICAR ensuring that the farmers get the best rather than biased advice that boosts the further rollout of proprietary products? Is there a system in place for the ICAR to develop research and education agendas from the farmers it is supposed to serve as opposed to being led by the whims and business ideas of corporations? The authors of the letter note that copies of the MoUs are not being shared proactively in the public domain by the ICAR. The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. As will be made clear in the following chapters, this is part of a broader geopolitical strategy to ensure India‚Äôs food dependence on foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or indeed national sovereignty). In a October 2024 report, GRAIN.org sheds some light: ‚ÄúJayachandra Sharma, a farmer leader from India‚Äôs Karnataka Rajya Ryot Sangha farmer union, sees these developments and the digitalisation of agriculture as part of a broader strategy to push millions of farmers out of agriculture and make India‚Äôs food supply dependent on global finance and foreign corporations. Given how companies like Microsoft, Syngenta, Amazon and JD.com are expanding, he could well be right.‚Äù Genuine approaches to addressing the challenges humanity faces are being ignored by policymakers or cynically attacked by corporate lobbyists. These solutions involve systemic shifts in agricultural, food and economic systems with a focus on low-consumption (energy) lifestyles, localisation and an ecologically sustainable agroecology. As activist John Wilson says, this is based on creative solutions, a connection to nature and the land, nurturing people, peaceful transformation and solidarity. Co-operative labour, fellowship and our long-standing spiritual connection to the land should inform how as a society we should live. This stands in stark contrast to the values and impacts of capitalism and technology based on instrumental rationality and too often fuelled by revenue streams and the goal to control populations. When we hear talk of a ‚Äòspiritual connection‚Äô, what is meant by ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô? In a broad sense it can be regarded as a concept that refers to thoughts, beliefs and feelings about the meaning of life, rather than just physical existence. A sense of connection to something greater than ourselves. Something akin to Weber‚Äôs concept of value rationality. The spiritual, the diverse and the local are juxtaposed with the selfishness of modern urban society, the increasing homogeneity of thought and practice and an instrumental rationality which becomes an end in itself. Having a direct link with nature/the land is fundamental to developing an appreciation of a type of ‚Äòbeing‚Äô and an ‚Äòunderstanding‚Äô that results in a reality worth living in. However, what we are seeing is an agenda based on a different set of values rooted in a lust for power and money and the total subjugation of ordinary people (and farmers) being rammed through under the false promise of techno solutionism (think neural laces to detect moods implanted in the skull, programmable digital money, track and trace technology etc.) and some distant notion of a techno utopia that leave malevolent power relations intact and unchallenged. Is this then to be humanity‚Äôs never-ending ‚Äúpolar night of icy darkness‚Äù? Hopefully not. This vision is being imposed from above. Ordinary people (whether, for example, farmers in India or those being beaten down through austerity policies) find themselves on the receiving end of a class war being waged against them by a mega rich elite. Indeed, in 1941, Herbert Marcuse stated that technology could be used as an instrument for control and domination. Precisely the agenda of the likes of Bayer, the Gates Foundation, BlackRock and the World Bank, which are trying to eradicate genuine diversity and impose a one-size-fits-all model of thinking and behaviour. A final thought courtesy of civil rights campaigner Frederick Douglass in a speech from 1857: ‚ÄúPower concedes nothing without a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any people will quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they are resisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.‚Äù In October 2024, Indian journalist Bharat Dogra noted the following trend in agriculture: ‚ÄúSmall farmers are being displaced and family farms are disappearing as those who are truly dedicated to farming have to say tearful farewells to their farms, while billionaires and richest corporations acquire millions of acres of farmland. While small scale food processors too are being pushed out and possibilities of direct contacts between farmers and consumers to promote sustainable livelihoods based on making available healthy food to all are diminishing, giant multinational companies are taking up food production, trade and processing in ways that are harmful for both consumers and farmers.‚Äù It might be an inconvenient truth for big agribusiness, land investors and agritech concerns that prefer large-scale industrial agriculture, but small-scale farmers and peasants feed most of the world. That means the types of farms Dogra refers to. What is more, small farms are more productive than their larger counterparts, which is why they are essential for food security. However, the trend noted by Dogra is apparent across the world. And it is something that, as yet, is still in the early stages in India. But have no doubt, this is the plan for India too, where small-scale farmers make up 85 per cent of the farming community. In late 2021, the Indian government announced that three important farm laws, which would have introduced neoliberal shock therapy to the agricultural sector, would be repealed after a one-year farmers‚Äô mobilisation against the legislation (although discussed below, for more in-depth insight into the issues that sparked the protest, see the relevant chapters in Food, Dependency and Dispossession: Resisting the New World Order). The repeal of the three laws was little more than a tactical manoeuvre given that state elections were upcoming in key rural heartlands in 2022. The powerful global interests behind the legislation have not gone away and farmers‚Äô concerns remain highly relevant. These interests have been behind a decades-long agenda to displace the prevailing agri-food system in India. The laws might have been struck down, but the goal to capture and radically restructure the sector remains. The farmers‚Äô struggle in India is not over. The repeal of the controversial farm laws in India may have been seen as a victory for protesting farmers, but it seems the government is pursuing alternative strategies to achieve similar agricultural reforms. These new approaches, while less direct, could potentially implement many of the changes originally proposed in the repealed legislation. The government seems to be gradually introducing smaller, incremental changes to agricultural policies that align with some of the original goals of the farm laws. For instance, an increased focus on digitalisation and technological solutions in agriculture could indirectly achieve some of the aims of the laws, and encouraging private investment and partnerships in the agricultural sector through other means could still lead to increased corporatisation. This chapter and the following three chapters will address this and will discuss the implications of a number of agreements between the Indian government and the likes of Amazon, Bayer and Syngenta that had little to no democratic oversight. But we will begin by looking at the claim that the BJP-led government was seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat it suffered at the hands of the farmers. This claim was made during a press conference that took place in Delhi in October 2023 held by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) (United Farmers Front). The SKM was formed in November 2020 as a coalition of more than 40 Indian farmers‚Äô unions to coordinate non-violent resistance against the three farm acts initiated two months before. Asserting that the laws violated the constitution and were anti-farmer and pro big business, the SKM announced renewed agitation and expressed grave concern about a crackdown by the government against the online media platform NewsClick, which supported the farmers throughout their one-year struggle. Those present heard that there has been ‚Äúbaseless dishonest and false allegations in the Newsclick FIR against the historic farmers‚Äô struggle‚Äù and that the ‚ÄúFIR accuses the farmers‚Äô movement as anti-national, funded by foreign and terrorist forces.‚Äù An FIR is a ‚Äòfirst information report‚Äô: a document prepared by police in India when they receive information about the commission of a ‚Äúcognisable‚Äù (serious) offence. Delhi Police issued an FIR against NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha and the human resources head Amit Chakravarty, which infers that the farmers‚Äô movement was aimed at stopping the supply of essential goods for citizens and creating law and order issues. An article on The Hindu newspaper‚Äôs Frontline portal describes the nature of the FIR, which goes far beyond the farmers‚Äô issue, and concludes police actions along with the FIR marks a major low point for media freedom in India. According to Frontline, the police raids on the offices of NewsClick and the residences of virtually anyone associated with it; the indiscriminate seizure of the electronic devices of journalists and other employees; the sealing of the news portal‚Äôs main office; the arrest of its founder-editor and its administrative officer on terrorism-related charges; and the searches conducted at the premises of NewsClick and the home of its founder-editor mark the lowest point for media freedom in India since the Emergency of 1975-1977. The withdrawal of the FIR against Newsclick was called for during the press conference. There was also a demand for the immediate release of NewsClick journalists. The SKM said that farmers across the country would burn copies of the FIR on 6 November 2023 after a sustained campaign at village level against the government‚Äôs pro-corporate policies from 1-5 November. The farmers‚Äô coalition also pledged to campaign in five poll-going states with the slogan ‚ÄúOppose Corporate, Punish BJP, Save Country.‚Äù It was also announced that a 72-hour sit-in would take place in front of the Raj Bhawans (official residences of state governors) in state capitals between 26 and 28 November. On November 13, 2024, the Supreme Court of India declared Purkayastha‚Äôs arrest and subsequent remand as invalid, emphasising that he and his legal counsel were not provided with the grounds for his arrest prior to his remand hearing. The court criticised the police for circumventing due process and noted that the lack of communication regarding the grounds of arrest severely hindered Purkayastha‚Äôs ability to defend himself. The Supreme Court‚Äôs ruling mandated his release upon fulfilling bail bond requirements set by the trial court. The case highlights ongoing concerns regarding press freedom in India, particularly in relation to government actions against journalists and media outlets perceived as critical of state policies. The SKM stated that the farmers‚Äô movement was committed and patriotic and saw through the ‚Äúnefarious plan‚Äù of the three farm laws to withdraw government support from agriculture and hand over farming, mandis (state-run wholesale agricultural markets) and public food distribution to corporations led by Adani, Ambani, Tata, Cargill, Pepsi, Walmart, Bayer, Amazon and others. It added that the farmers exposed the corporate-backed plan of depriving the people of India of food security, pauperising farmers, changing cropping patterns to suit corporations and allowing the free penetration of foreign corporations into India‚Äôs food processing market. Those in attendance also heard about the hardships experienced by farmers during the one-year agitation: ‚ÄúIn the process, the farmers braved water cannons, teargas shelling, roadblocks with huge containers, deep road cuts, lathi charge, cold and hot weather. Over 13 months, they sacrificed 732 martyrs‚Ä¶ This was a patriotic movement of the highest quality in the face of repression by a fascist government serving interests of Imperialist exploiters.‚Äù State investment in agriculture infrastructure was called for, along with the promotion of profitable farming, the facilitation and securing of modern food processing, marketing and consumer networks under the collective ownership and control of peasant-worker cooperatives. Accusing the government of acting on behalf of corporate interests, one speaker said that it had targeted Newsclick because it only did what a genuine news media should have been doing ‚Äî reporting on the truth, the problems of farmers and the nature of the struggle. It was claimed that: ‚ÄúThe BJP Government is using the farcical FIR to spread a canard that the farmers‚Äô movement was anti-people, anti-national and backed by terrorist funding routed through Newsclick. This is factually wrong and mischievously inserted to portray the movement in bad light and seeking to extract revenge for the humiliating defeat they suffered at the hands of the farmers of our country.‚Äù The farmers‚Äô coalition argued that the government is moving to falsely charge the farmers movement of being foreign funded and sponsored by terrorist forces, while it is ‚Äúpromoting FDI, Foreign MNCs, big corporations into agriculture.‚Äù The coalition said it remains committed to saving the rural economy, preventing foreign looting and rejuvenating the village economy in order to build a strong India. In 2024, farmers were still protesting. Facilitation of the neoliberal corporatisation of farming that sparked the previous protest remains on the board and farmers‚Äô demands have not been met. The World Bank, the WTO, global agribusiness and financial capital are working to corporatise India‚Äôs agriculture sector. This plan goes back to the early 1990s and India‚Äôs foreign exchange crisis, which was used (and manipulated) to set this plan in motion. This debt-trap ‚Äòstructural adjustment‚Äô policy and process involves displacing the current food production system with contract farming and an industrial model of agriculture and food retail that serves the above interests. The aim is to reduce the role of the public sector in agriculture to a facilitator of private capital, which requires industrial commodity-crop farming. The beneficiaries will include Cargill, Archer Daniels Midlands, Louis Dreyfus, Bunge and India‚Äôs retail and agribusiness giants as well as the global agritech, seed and agrochemical corporations and the big tech companies with their ‚Äòdata-driven agriculture‚Äô. The plan is to displace the peasantry, create a land market and amalgamate landholdings to form larger farms that are more suited to international land investors and industrial farming. As a result, there has been an ongoing strategy to make farming non-viable for many of India‚Äôs smallholder farmers and force hundreds of millions out of farming and into urban centres that have already sprawled to form peri-urban areas, which often tend to contain the most agriculturally fertile land. The loss of such land should be a concern in itself. It is not as though farmers want to leave farming. It tends to be in their blood. But if the are unable to cover the costs of production and make a decent living due to the lack of guaranteed prices and the issues laid out below, they will flock to the cities to try to gain a foothold in urban economies. And what will those hundreds of millions do? Driven to the cities because of deliberate impoverishment, they will serve as cheap labour or, more likely, an unemployed or underemployed reserve army of labour for global capital ‚Äî labour which is being replaced with automation. They will be in search of jobs that are increasingly hard to come by the (World Bank reports that there is more than 23 per cent youth unemployment in India). The impoverishment of farmers results from rising input costs, the withdrawal of government assistance, debt and debt repayments and the impacts of cheap, subsidised imports, which depress farmers‚Äô incomes. While corporations in India receive massive handouts and have loans written off, the lack of a secure income, exposure to volatile and manipulated international market prices and cheap imports contribute to farmers‚Äô misery of not being able to cover the costs of production and secure a decent standard of living. The pressure from the richer nations for the Indian government to further reduce support given to farmers and open up to imports and export-oriented ‚Äòfree market‚Äô trade is based on nothing but hypocrisy. For instance, policy analyst Devinder Sharma comments that subsidies provided to US wheat and rice farmers are more than the market worth of these two crops. He also notes that, per day, each cow in Europe receives a subsidy worth more than an Indian farmer‚Äôs daily income. The World Bank, the WTO, global institutional investors and transnational agribusiness giants require corporate-dictated contract farming and full-scale neoliberal marketisation for the sale and procurement of produce. They demand that India sacrifice its farmers and its own food security for the benefit of a handful of billionaires. Farmers are merely regarded as producers of raw materials (crops) to be fleeced by suppliers of chemical and biotech inputs and the food processing and retail conglomerates. The more farmers can be squeezed, the greater the profits these corporations can extract. This entails creating farmer dependency on costly external inputs and corporate-dominated markets and supply chains. Global agrifood corporations have cleverly and cynically weaved a narrative that equates eradicating food sovereignty and creating dependency with ‚Äòfood security‚Äô. In 2018, a charter was released by the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (an umbrella group of around 250 farmers‚Äô organisations). The farmers were concerned about the deepening penetration of predatory corporations and the unbearable burden of indebtedness and the widening disparities between farmers and other sectors. They wanted the government to take measures to bring down the input costs of farming, while making purchases of farm produce below the minimum support price (MSP) both illegal and punishable. The charter also called for a special discussion on the universalisation of the public distribution system (PDS), the withdrawal of pesticides that have been banned elsewhere and the non-approval of genetically engineered seeds without a comprehensive need and impact assessment. Other demands included no foreign direct investment in agriculture and food processing, the protection of farmers from corporate plunder in the name of contract farming, investment in farmers‚Äô collectives to create farmer producer organisations and peasant cooperatives and the promotion of agroecology based on suitable cropping patterns and local seed diversity revival. These demands remain relevant today due to government inaction. In fact, the three farm laws that were repealed aimed to do precisely the opposite. They were intended to expose Indian agriculture to a massive dose of neoliberal marketisation and shock therapy. Although the laws were struck down, the corporate interests behind them never went away and are adamant that the Indian government implements the policies they require. This would mean India reducing the state procurement and distribution of essential foodstuffs and eradicating its food buffer stocks ‚Äî so vital to national food security ‚Äî and purchasing the nation‚Äôs needs with its foreign exchange reserves on manipulated global commodity markets. This would make the country wholly dependent on attracting foreign investment and international finance. To ensure food sovereignty and national food security, the Mumbai-based Research Unit for Political Economy (RUPE) says that MSPs, through government procurement of essential crops and commodities, should be extended to many major cops such as maize, cotton, oilseed and pulses. At the moment, only farmers in certain states who produce rice and wheat are the main beneficiaries of government procurement at the MSP. Since per capita protein consumption in India is abysmally low and has fallen further during the liberalisation era, the provision of pulses in the PDS is long overdue and desperately needed. The PDS works with central government, via the Food Corporation of India, being responsible for buying food grains from farmers at MSPs at state-run market yards or mandis. It then allocates the grains to each state. State governments then deliver to ‚Äòration shops‚Äô. In 2024, farm union leaders were still seeking guarantees for a minimum purchase price for crops. Although the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year, government agencies buy only rice and wheat at the support level and, even then, in only some states. State agencies buy the two staples at government-fixed minimum support prices to build reserves to run the world‚Äôs biggest food welfare programme that entitles more than 800 million Indians to free rice and wheat. Currently, that‚Äôs more than half the population who per household will receive five kilos per month of these essential foodstuffs for at least the next four years, which would be denied to them by the ‚Äòfree market‚Äô. As we have seen throughout the world, corporate plunder under the guise of neoliberal marketisation is no friend of the poor and those in need who rely on state support to exist. If public procurement of a wider range of crops at the MSP were to occur ‚Äî and MSPs were guaranteed for rice and wheat across all states ‚Äî it would help address hunger and malnutrition, encourage crop diversification and ease farmer distress. By helping hundreds of millions involved in farming this way, it would give a massive boost to rural spending power and the economy in general. Instead of rolling back the role of the public sector and surrendering the system to what constitutes a transnational billionaire class and its corporations, there is a need to further expand official procurement and public distribution. The RUPE notes, it would cost around 20 per cent of the current handouts (‚Äòincentives‚Äô) received by corporations and their super-rich owners, which do not benefit the bulk of the wider population in any way. It is also worth considering that the loans provided to just five large corporations in India were in 2016 equal to the entire farm debt. However, it is clear that the existence of the MSP, the public distribution system and publicly held buffer stocks are an impediment to global agribusiness interests. In the meantime, the current administration is keen to demonstrate to international finance capital and agricapital that it is being tough on farmers and remains steadfast in its willingness to facilitate the pro-corporate agenda. In 2024, after the breakdown in talks between government and farmers‚Äô representatives, the farmers decided to peacefully march to and demonstrate in Delhi. But at the Delhi border, farmers were met with barricades, tear gas and state violence. However, to date, current farmers‚Äô resistance lacks the momentum of the 2020-21 protests. Furthermore, by one means or another, as the following chapters indicate, the central government continues to ignore the key demands of farmers and hand over the sector to global agribusiness and other corporate interests Farmers produce humanities‚Äô most essential need and are not the ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô. The spotlight should fall on the ‚Äòenemy beyond‚Äô. Instead of depicting farmers as ‚Äòanti-national‚Äô, as sections of the media and prominent commentators in India try to, the focus needs to be on challenging those interests that seek to gain from undermining India‚Äôs food security and sovereignty and the impoverishment of farmers. The citizens of India have a problem. In what the media like to call ‚Äòthe world‚Äôs biggest democracy‚Äô, there is a serious, proven conflict of interest among officials in the areas of science, agriculture and agricultural research that results in privileging the needs of powerful private interests ahead of farmers and ordinary people. This has been a longstanding concern. In 2013, for instance, prominent campaigner and environmentalist Aruna Rodrigues said: ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Agriculture has handed Monsanto and the industry access to our agri-research public institutions, placing them in a position to seriously influence agri-policy in India. You cannot have a conflict of interest larger or more alarming than this one.‚Äù In 2020, Kavitha Kuruganti (Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture) stated that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee had acted more like a servant for Monsanto: there is an ongoing revolving door between crop developers (even patent holders) and regulators, with developers-cum-lobbyists sitting on regulatory bodies. However, the capture of public policymaking space by the private sector is set to accelerate due to a recent spate of memorandums of understanding between state institutions and influential private corporations involved in agriculture and agricultural services, including Bayer and Amazon. As part of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and Amazon (June 2023), farmers will produce for Amazon Fresh stores in India as part of a ‚Äòfarm to fork‚Äô supply chain. It will see ‚Äúcritical inputs‚Äù in agriculture and ‚Äúseason-based crop plans‚Äù in collaboration with Amazon based on ‚Äútechnologies, capacity building and transfer of new knowledge.‚Äù This corporate jargon ties in with the much-publicised notion of ‚Äòdata-driven agriculture‚Äô centred on cloud-based data information services (which Amazon also offers). In this model, data is to be accessed and controlled by corporates and the farmer will be told how much production is expected, how much rain is anticipated, what type of soil quality there is, what must be produced and what type of genetically engineered seeds and inputs they must purchase and from whom. This amounts to a recolonisation of Indian agriculture, which will eventually involve a handful of data owners (Microsoft, Amazon etc.), input suppliers (Bayer, Corteva, Syngenta etc.) and retail concerns (Amazon and Walmart-Flipkart ‚Äî both firms already control 60 per cent of India‚Äôs e-commerce market) at the heights of the agrifood economy, determining the nature of agriculture and peddling industrial food. Farmers who remain in this AI-driven system (a stated aim is farmerless farms) will be reduced to exploitable labour at the mercy of global conglomerates. This is part of a broader strategy to shift hundreds of millions out of agriculture, ensure India‚Äôs food dependence on global finance and foreign corporations and eradicate any semblance of food democracy (or national sovereignty). In addition to the MoU with Amazon, an MoU was signed between the ICAR and Bayer in September 2023. Bayer (it bought Monsanto in 2018), which profits from various environmentally harmful and disease-causing chemicals like glyphosate, signed the MoU to help ‚Äúdevelop resource-efficient, climate-resilient solutions for crops, varieties, crop protection, weed and mechanization‚Äù, according to the ICAR website. The ICAR is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India, and Bayer seems likely to exploit the ICAR‚Äôs vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products. But that‚Äôs not all. According to the non-profit GRAIN in its article ‚ÄòThe corporate agenda behind carbon farming‚Äô, Bayer is gaining increasing control over farmers in various countries, dictating exactly how they farm and what inputs they use through its Carbon Program. GRAIN says: ‚ÄúYou can see in the evolution of Bayer‚Äôs programmes that, for corporations, carbon farming is all about increasing their control within the food system. It‚Äôs certainly not about sequestering carbon.‚Äù Given the seriousness of what is laid out by GRAIN in its article, India‚Äôs citizens and farmers should take heed, especially as the ICAR website states that a focus of the MoU with Bayer will be on developing carbon credit markets. In a letter (July 2004) to Rabindra Padaria, principal scientist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), and Himanshu Pathak, director-general of the ICAR, Aruna Rodrigues says: ‚ÄúInking in ICAR‚Äôs formal partnership with Bayer (Monsanto) quite simply confirms straightforwardly that the ICAR protects its interest, which is the same as those of Bayer-Monsanto, large chemical/herbicide corporates‚Ä¶ the ICAR has ditched its mandate to Indian farmers and farming, which is to promote farmer interests as a priority in an unbiased and objective assessment of what is right and good for Indian farming and food‚Ä¶ ‚Äú A separate citizens‚Äô letter was also sent to Pathak on the various MoUs that the Indian government has signed with influential private orporations. Hundreds of scientists, farmer leaders, farmers and ordinary citizens signed the letter. It states: ‚ÄúBayer is a company notorious for its anti-people, anti-nature business products and operations in itself and, furthermore, after its takeover of Monsanto. Its deadly poisons have violated basic human rights of peoples across the world, and it is a company that has always prioritised profits over people and planet.‚Äù It goes on to say that it is not clear what the ICAR will learn from Bayer that the well-paid public sector scientists of the institution cannot develop themselves. The letter says entities that have been responsible for causing an economic and environmental crisis in Indian agriculture are being partnered by ICAR for so-called solutions when these entities are only interested in their profits and not sustainability (or any other nomenclature they use). The letter asks that the ICAR suspends the signed MoUs, shares all details in the public domain and desists from signing any more such MoUs without necessary public debate. However, on 19 July 2024, there were reports that the ICAR had signed another MoU, this time with Syngenta for promoting climate resilient agriculture and training programmes. In response, the authors of the letter state that the ICAR has (again) partnered with a corporation that has a track record of anti-nature and anti-people activities, selling toxic products like paraquat, class action suits against its corn seeds and anti-competitive behaviour. It is becoming clear who the ICAR actually serves. Let us return to Aruna Rodrigues and her letter to Rabindra Padaria (IARI) and Himanshu Pathak (ICAR) for additional insight. Rodrigues‚Äô letter focuses on the commercial cultivation of basmati rice varieties tolerant to imazethapyr-based, non-selective herbicides. These chemicals can be liberally sprayed on herbicide tolerant (HT) crops because the crops have been manipulated to withstand the toxic impacts of spraying. The HT varieties of rice have undergone some form of mutagenesis rather than genetic engineering. Mutagenesis has traditionally involved subjecting plant cells to chemical or physical agents (for example, radiation) that cause mutations to the DNA in the hope that a resulting mutation may produce a desirable effect in the plant. This kind of mutation breeding has been used for decades but only affects a minority of the plants on the market. Industry watchdog GMWatch says this risky technology (mutagenesis breeding) in the past managed to escape regulation. So, this HT crop by the mutagenesis route is not defined as ‚Äògenetic engineering‚Äô (the method usually used to create HT crops) and therefore falls outside the purview of current regulations on genetically modified organisms. Although the Supreme Court-appointed Technical Expert Committee (TEC) bars HT crops (a) for being an HT crop and (b) on account of contamination of crops in a centre of genetic diversity, it has been a long-standing aim of biotech companies like Bayer (Monsanto) to get HT crops cultivated in India. Rodrigues asks: ‚ÄúIs it a deliberate decision of the ICAR to use the mutagenesis route to produce HT rice varieties (tolerant to imazethapyr) with the explicit objective to bypass the formal regulation of GE crops/GMOs?‚Äù Rodrigues accuses the ICAR of effectively ditching its mandate to Indian farmers, many of whom regard organic farming as their competitive advantage. This step is also a potential threat to India‚Äôs export markets, which are based on organic standards, along with the necessary co-surety that India‚Äôs foods and farms are not contaminated by herbicides, a consequence of using HT crops. By adding a trait for herbicide tolerance, the ICAR is informed: ‚ÄúICAR‚Äôs action directly impacts this vital issue of contaminating our germ plasm in rice and contravenes a Supreme Court Order of ‚ÄúNo Contamination‚Äù. Furthermore, our export markets for basmati are in excess of US $5 billion in 2023-24. Your action will also directly impact India‚Äôs exports and thereby, impact farmer export potential, incomes and income opportunities that premium prices provide.‚Äù Moreover, Rodrigues asserts that the entire mutagenesis process for HT rice must be elaborated, especially when the mutant variety is for the purpose of human consumption. The ICAR is duty-bound to provide, for example, whether a physical or a chemical mutagen was used, the range of doses used and the toxicity for the said material, the herbicide(s) used (a key concern, given the effects of certain herbicides on human health ‚Äî see below) to test the HT of the basmati rice being used, the concentrations of the herbicides used and the genetic mechanism by which HT rice through mutagenesis has a resistant gene to imazethapyr. While the issue of intellectual property rights for the HT rice varieties using mutagenesis is unclear, the ICAR and IARI have executed a technology transfer agreement of the HT trait for commercial cultivation. In her letter, Rodrigues states that, based on empirical evidence of 35 years of HT crops in the US and Argentina, HT crops are a failed technology: it spawns super weeds, increased herbicide use and no added performance yield. Moreover, for India, HT crops are a perverse use of technology, whether genetic engineering or through mutagenesis, that risks small and marginal farmers‚Äô crops and herbs and plants used in many Ayurvedic medicines because of herbicide drift. It will also uniquely impact the employment of women in weeding. Rodrigues goes on to state (with evidence provided) that in the US overall herbicide use has increased more than tenfold since the introduction of HT Crops (1992-2012 figure). In addition, HT crops are designed for monocultures and completely unsuited to Indian small-holder, multi-crop farming: anything not HT will be destroyed, the resistant crop stands, but everything else dies, including non-target organisms. The herbicides used with HT crops are also a major human health issue. There is a strong link between glyphosate and non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma. In relation to this, there are more than 100,000 lawsuits winding their way through US Courts. Glyphosate (used in Bayer‚Äôs Roundup herbicide) is also an endocrine disruptor and is linked to birth defects. Monsanto and the US Environmental Protection Agency had both known for over 40 years that glyphosate and its formulations cause cancer. Other herbicides used by Bayer include glufosinate (used in its Liberty herbicide), which is acknowledged as more toxic than glyphosate and, like it, is a systemic, broad spectrum, non-selective herbicide. It is a neurotoxin that can cause nerve damage and birth defects and is damaging to most plants that come into contact with it. Glufinosate is banned in Europe and not permitted in India. It has been implicated in brain developmental abnormalities in animal studies and is very persistent in the environment, so it will certainly contaminate water supplies in addition to food where it will be absorbed. Imazethapyr (contained in Bayer‚Äôs Adue herbicide) is also a systemic broad-spectrum herbicide and is banned in some countries and not approved for use in the EU. Prof. Jack Heinemann (University of Canterbury in New Zealand) adds that the likes of imazethapyr must be tested for their ability to cause bacterial antibiotic resistance. An important concern given that India‚Äôs population has some of the highest levels of antibiotic resistance in the world. Any spread of HT crops would put people at severe risk of resistance and disease. Despite these environmental and health concerns, the herbicide market in India is projected to grow by around 54 per cent in the next five years, from USD 361.85 million in 2024 to USD 558.17 million by 2029. Rodrigues concludes: ‚ÄúIn view of the above evidence of serious irreversible harm to health, food and agriculture across several dimensions and contravention of the PP (Precautionary Principle), it is a required scientific response for the ICAR to immediately withdraw HT rice varieties and desist from introducing any HT crop through mutagenesis.‚Äù Environmentalist and campaigner Rosemary Mason has been relentlessly exposing the insidious effects of agrochemicals on human health and the environment through a decade-long series of incisive reports. Many of these reports have taken the form of scathing open letters directed at corporations, regulators and officials in the UK and the EU. Mason has never held back in her condemnations of the agrochemical giants. After Bayer‚Äôs acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, her focus sharpened on Bayer, scrutinising its troubling history and its actions, not least during one of humanity‚Äôs darkest chapters: Nazi Germany. Bayer‚Äôs complicity as part of IG Farben, a chemical and pharmaceutical conglomerate notorious for its involvement in war crimes, is well documented. The company was formed in 1925 from a merger of six chemical firms: Agfa, BASF, Bayer, Chemische Fabrik Griesheim-Elektron, Hoechst and Weiler-ter-Meer. Bayer was not merely an observer but an active participant in heinous medical experiments conducted on concentration camp inmates. These experiments involved testing drugs on unwilling subjects, including those at Auschwitz, where prisoners were deliberately infected with diseases to evaluate Bayer‚Äôs pharmaceuticals. During World War I, Bayer was involved in the development of chemical weapons, including chlorine and mustard gas. As part of IG Farben, Bayer later contributed to the creation of nerve agents like Tabun, Sarin and Soman. Post-war, Bayer transitioned these chemical developments into pesticides such as parathion, which are neurotoxic. In addition, IG Farben was implicated in the production of Zyklon B, the gas used in concentration camps. Executives from IG Farben were convicted for their roles in war crimes at the Nuremberg Trials. . IG Farben Building, Frankfurt, completed in 1931 and seized by the Allies in 1945 as the headquarters of the Supreme Allied Command. In 2001 it became part of the University of Frankfurt. (Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0) . Bayer‚Äôs leadership was fully aware of these atrocities yet chose profit over ethics, benefiting from the forced labour of concentration camp inmates to produce essential chemicals for the Nazi war machine. The aftermath of World War II saw Bayer and other IG Farben companies face minimal repercussions for their actions. While some executives were tried, they received light sentences or were released early, allowing them to reclaim positions of power within their companies. As for Bayer, things did not stop with the end of the war. The Powerbase website provides a very long list of Bayer‚Äôs corporate wrongdoings since 1945, including allegations of corporate bullying, monopolistic practices, the suppression of scientific information, bribery, poisonings, false advertising and abusing workers. More recently, Bayer has inherited a legacy of deception through its acquisition of Monsanto. Both companies have been accused of concealing the health risks associated with glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup and the world‚Äôs most used agricultural herbicide. Internal documents reveal a concerted effort to downplay glyphosate‚Äôs carcinogenicity while ignoring substantial evidence indicating its dangers to human health. In her numerous reports, Mason has indicated how Bayer shaped regulatory processes to secure product approvals, influencing scientific studies and regulatory decisions while suppressing contrary evidence. The environmental devastation wrought by pesticides is alarming: Mason cites significant declines in biodiversity and poisoned ecosystems that she claims are as a direct consequence of the widespread use of Bayer‚Äôs chemicals. Moreover, rising cancer rates in communities exposed to Bayer‚Äôs products cannot be ignored, especially increasing cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma linked to glyphosate use in areas heavily treated with these chemicals. Rosemary Mason is not alone in her condemnation of Bayer. For instance, journalist Carey Gillam has written extensively about Bayer-Monsanto‚Äôs practices, particularly in relation to glyphosate and its health impacts in the book ‚ÄòWhitewash: The Story of a Weed Killer, Cancer, and the Corruption of Science‚Äô. Gillam says: ‚ÄúUS Roundup litigation began in 2015 after the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified glyphosate as a probable human carcinogen. Internal Monsanto documents dating back decades show that the company was aware of scientific research linking its weed killer to cancer but instead of warning consumers, the company worked to suppress the information and manipulate scientific literature.‚Äù Gillam has shown that, over the years, Monsanto mounted a deceitful defence of its health- and environment-damaging Roundup and its genetically modified crops, and it orchestrated toxic smear campaigns against anyone ‚Äî scientist or campaigner ‚Äî who threatened its interests. With that in mind, it comes as no surprise that a US-Based PR firm has created a watchlist, profiling activists, scientists and journalists who are critical of pesticide use and genetically modified organisms, as recently revealed in documents obtained by the investigative newsroom Lighthouse Reports. As a result of a year-long investigation, Lighthouse Reports argues that this operation seeks to cast pesticide critics, environmental scientists or campaigners as an anti-science ‚Äúprotest industry‚Äù and used US government money to do so. The watchlist is the brainchild of Jay Byrne, a former communications executive at Monsanto, and his reputation management firm v-Fluence. It comprises profiles (including personal information) on hundreds of scientists, campaigners and writers. These profiles have been published on a private social network, which grants privileged access to 1,000 people comprising a who‚Äôs-who of the agrochemical industry, alongside government officials from multiple countries. The US government funded v-Fluence as part of its programme to promote genetically modified organisms in Africa and Asia, including ‚Äúenhanced monitoring‚Äù of critics of ‚Äúmodern agriculture approaches‚Äù ‚Äî and to build the network. Watchlists and hitlists aside, to further its interests, the agrochemical giants pour huge resources into lobbying that seeks to shape narratives, deceive and coerce rather than engage with genuine public health and environmental concerns. The research and campaign group Corporate Europe Observatory (CEO) recently took a deep dive into Bayer‚Äôs disturbing ‚Äútoxic trail‚Äù of lobbying as the company strives to maintain its huge slice of the seed and pesticides markets, fight off regulatory challenges to its toxic products, limit legal liability and exercise political influence. CEO‚Äôs report ‚ÄòBayer‚Äôs Toxic Trails: Market Power, Monopolies and the Global Lobbying of an Agrochemicals Giant‚Äô notes that Bayer spent between ‚Ç¨7 million and ‚Ç¨8 million in 2023 on EU lobbying, the biggest sum declared by any individual chemical company and the highest amount ever spent by Bayer on EU lobbying. According to CEO, Bayer‚Äôs current top lobbying priority in Europe is to derail the original ambitions of the European Green Deal and to prevent any of the company‚Äôs firmly established interests (chemicals and pesticides) from being touched. One of the central goals of this deal is to reduce the use and risk of chemical pesticides by 50 per cent by 2030 through the EU‚Äôs Farm to Fork strategy. This target aims to address both environmental and public health concerns associated with pesticide use in agriculture. Bayer‚Äôs lobby spend in the US has also risen considerably over the past few years, spending $7.5 million in 2023 alone, some of which is aimed at securing changes in the law to prevent further litigation cases and more hefty payouts to people suffering from conditions due to glyphosate exposure. To date, the company has reportedly paid out approximately $11 billion to settle nearly 100,000 lawsuits stemming from claims that Roundup causes cancer, particularly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. CEO states: ‚ÄúBayer‚Äôs lobby tactics continue to capture public policymaking and in doing so hollow out democracy. A perverse symbiosis between corporate lobby groups and decision-makers has been actively created through its economic weight and large investments in many corners of the world, and this consistently leads to crucial decisions being made in favour of industry profits, rather than public interest.‚Äù It concludes that: ‚ÄúAround the world, Bayer‚Äôs modus operandi is not to work in the public interest but rather to capture public policy to serve its private interests and dividends of its shareholders, all while ignoring the public health and environmental impact of its activities.‚Äù So, why would a government want to do a deal with the devil? As stated in the previous chapter, that is precisely what the government of India seems to have done when it signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer signed the MoU with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR), which is responsible for co-ordinating agricultural education and research in India. Bayer‚Äôs aim first and foremost seems to be to exploit the ICAR‚Äôs vast infrastructure and networks to pursue its own commercial plans, including boosting sales of toxic proprietary products and the introduction of genetically modified food crops into India. These crops would be reliant on Bayer‚Äôs agrochemicals. Attempts to get genetically modified food crops into India‚Äôs fields is being done by all means necessary, as explained in Aruna Rodrigues insightful online article Waltzing with Bayer Makes The Indian Council of Agricultural Research Blind: India Ditches Mandate to Farmers and Uses Mutagenesis to Drive Toxic HT Crops Into India. That article explains that mutagenetic techniques are being used to bypass existing regulatory procedures in relation to genetically modified organisms, despite a recent Supreme Court directive for the government to formulate a national policy framework on genetically modified crops based on a democratic consultative process. Telangana State Seed Development Corporation chairman S Anvesh Reddy recently stated that farmers want a bio-safety policy and not a promotional policy for genetically modified crops. However, they are in danger of getting the latter. Prominent campaigner Kavitha Kuruganti has warned that the Ministry of Agriculture may bypass the democratic consultative processes recommended by the Supreme Court. It has already appointed a panel of ‚Äòexperts‚Äô to draft the policy and information about it is being kept secret. On X (formerly Twitter), agricultural policy specialist Devinder Sharma stated: ‚ÄúHow can a policy be framed for GM crops when there is still no consensus on the need for these crops? Despite heavy lobbying by industry, most countries oppose it.‚Äù How can this be? Let us turn to Aruna Rodrigues: ‚ÄúOur regulatory bodies have been captured by the biotech and agrichemical industries‚Ä¶ It is breathtaking; all pretence is gone. We have a cancer that is metastasising vertically and horizontally throughout the entire regulatory body.‚Äù The need for genetically modified food crops is based on unsound logic, and, in general, neither farmers nor the public want them (see the online article Challenging the Flawed Premise Behind Pushing GMOs into Indian Agriculture). Moreover, the failure of Bt cotton in the country, India‚Äôs only officially approved genetically modified crop (see The Failure of GMO Cotton In India on resilience.org), should serve as a warning. In the meantime, farmers‚Äô leaders from 18 states in India have resolved to oppose genetically modified crops. They say genetically modified organisms in agriculture are harmful to human and animal health, the environment, farmers‚Äô livelihoods and trade and are based on failed promises. For some critics, if one firm tops a league table for anti-people, anti-nature business practices, it is Bayer (although there are many other worthy candidates). Nevertheless, as previously stated, the Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) signed a memorandum of understanding with Bayer in September 2023. Bayer‚Äôs approach to agricultural development involves promoting a model of industrial agriculture dependent on corporate products, including its toxic chemicals and genetically modified crops, and advocating for precision, data-driven agriculture that relies heavily on its proprietary technologies and software. Simon Wiebusch, Country Divisional Head of Crop Science for Bayer South Asia, recently stated that India cannot become a ‚Äòdeveloped nation‚Äô with ‚Äòbackward‚Äô agriculture. He believes India‚Äôs agriculture sector must modernise for the country to achieve developed nation status by 2047. Bayer‚Äôs vision for agriculture in India includes prioritising and fast-tracking approvals for its new products, introducing genetically modified food crops, addressing labour shortages (for weeding) by increasingly focusing on herbicides and developing herbicides for specific crops like paddy, wheat, sugarcane and maize. Government institutions like the ICAR seem likely to allow Bayer to leverage the agency‚Äôs infrastructure and networks to pursue its commercial plans. Wiebusch‚Äôs comments have received much media coverage. There is a tendency for journalists and media outlets to accept statements made by people in top corporate jobs as pearls of wisdom never to be critically questioned, especially in India when there is talk of the country achieving the gold standard in the eyes of some: ‚Äòdeveloped status‚Äô. But people like Wiebusch are hardly objective. They are not soothsayers who have an unbiased view of the world and its future. Bayer has a view of what agriculture should look like and is gaining increasing control of farmers in various countries in terms of having a direct influence on how they farm and what inputs they use. Its digital platforms are intended to be one-stop shops for carbon credits, seeds, pesticides and fertilisers and agronomic advice, all supplied by the company, which gets the added benefit of control over the agronomic and financial data harvested from farms. As for carbon credits, the non-profit GRAIN argues that, like digital platforms per se, carbon trading is about consolidating control within the food system and is certainly not about sequestering carbon. So, what does Wiebusch mean when he talks about modernisation of a backward agriculture in India? All of what is set out above and more. Like Wiebusch, corporate lobbyists often refer to ‚Äòmodern agriculture‚Äô. Instead, we should really be advocating for a system that produces healthy food for all while sustaining farming communities and livelihoods. That‚Äôs because the term ‚Äòmodern agriculture‚Äô is deliberately deceptive: it means a system dependent on proprietary inputs and integrated with corporate global supply chains. Anything other is defined as ‚Äòbackward‚Äô. According to Bayer, Wiebusch is a star player who can drive market share and create business value for the company. On the Bayer India website it says: ‚ÄúSimon‚Äôs key strengths include unlocking business growth, redefining distribution strategies, driving change management and building diverse teams that drive market share and create business value.‚Äù Stripped of the corporate jargon and any talk of ‚Äòhelping‚Äô India, the goal is to secure control of the sector and ensure corporate dependency. That is what is really meant by creating business value and driving market share. India has achieved self-sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food (in terms of calories) available to feed its entire population. It is the world‚Äôs largest producer of milk, pulses and millets and the second-largest producer of rice, wheat, sugarcane, groundnuts, vegetables, fruit and cotton. In 2014, environmental scientist Viva Kermani stated that India has been self-sufficient in food staples for over a decade and more than that for cereals. She noted that the country: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ grows about 100 million tons (mt) of rice, 95 mt of wheat, 170 mt of vegetables, 85 mt of fruit, 40 mt of coarse cereals and 18 mt of pulses (refer to the Economic Survey for the data). These totals ensure that our farmers grow enough to feed all Indians well with food staples. We have 66 mt of grain, two-and-a-half times the required buffer stock (on January 1, 2013).‚Äù She concluded: ‚ÄúThe country has reached this stage through, first and foremost, the knowledge and skill of our farmers who have bred and saved seed themselves and exchanged their seed in ways that made our fields so biodiverse.‚Äù Kermani also observed that farmers have legitimate claims to being scientists, innovators, natural resource stewards, seed savers and hybridisation experts. However, they have too often been reduced to becoming recipients of technical fixes and consumers of the poisonous products of a growing agricultural inputs industry. It is clear that Bayer needs India for its corporate growth strategy, but who needs Bayer? Bhaskar Save certainly did not on his impressively bountiful organic farm in Gujarat. In 2006, he described in an eight-page open letter (along with six annexures) to M S Swaminathan (widely regarded as the father of the Green Revolution in India) how the type of chemical-intensive agriculture that Bayer promotes and the urban-centric model of development favoured by the government has had devastating environmental economic and social consequences for India. Save offered agroecological alternatives to address the problems, including solutions to boost farmer incomes and rural communities, cultivate a wider range of nutrient-dense crops, build soil fertility, improve water management, enhance on-farm ecology and increase biodiversity. The prominent environmentalist Vandana Shiva recently posted on X: ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs agriculture was sustained over 10,000 years because it was based on nature‚Äôs laws of diversity, recycling, regeneration & circularity. Albert Howard spread organic farming worldwide learning from Indian peasants. Working with nature is sophistication, not backwardness. ‚ÄúBayer calling India‚Äôs agriculture backward is a new toxic colonisation. Bayer/Monsanto, the poison cartel whose roots are in war, has driven biodiversity to extinction with monocultures, spread cancers with glyphosate & herbicides, destroyed democracy.‚Äù It seems that the ‚Äòpoor‚Äô must be helped out of their awful ‚Äòbackwardness‚Äô by the West and its powerful corporations and billionaire ‚Äòphilanthropists‚Äô like Bill Gates. What some might regard as ‚Äòbackward‚Äô stems from an ethnocentric ideology, which is used to legitimise the destruction of communities and economies that were once locally based and self-sufficient. Bayer promotes a corporate expansionist ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô agenda that is self-sustaining and can be described as anything but development (see the online article Resisting Genetically Mutilated Food and the Eco-Modern Nightmare). Companies like Bayer present their technologies and products as fixes for the problems created by the model of ‚Äògrowth‚Äô and ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô they promote. ‚ÄòScientific innovation‚Äô is touted as the answer. The proposed solutions often create new problems or worsen existing ones. This leads to a cycle of dependency on corporate products and technologies. Monsanto‚Äôs failed Bt cotton in India being a case in point. Problems created by corporate-led development become opportunities for further corporate inputs and the commodification of knowledge and further ‚Äòexpert‚Äô interventions. The primary motivation is financial gain rather than genuine societal improvement. Corporate-driven ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô is a misnomer, especially in agriculture, as it often leads to regression in terms of health, environmental sustainability and rural community resilience, while perpetuating a cycle of problems and ‚Äòsolutions‚Äô that primarily benefit large corporations. But the type of agroecological solutions presented by the likes of Bhaskar Save run counter to Bayer‚Äôs aims of more pesticides, more genetically modified organisms, more control and corporate consolidation. For example, as previously mentioned, the industry seeks to derail the EU‚Äôs farm to fork strategy (which involves a dramatic reduction in agrochemical use), and Bayer spends record amounts to shape policies to its advantage, courtesy of its entrenched lobbying networks. Of course, Bayer presents its neocolonial aspirations in terms of helping backward Indian farmers. A good old dose of Western saviourism. To promote its model, Bayer must appear to offer practical solutions. It uses the narrative of climate emergency to promote a Ponzi carbon trading scheme that is resulting in land displacement across the world. And Bayer says that labour shortages for manual weeding in Indian agriculture are a significant challenge, so the rollout of toxic herbicides like glyphosate are a necessity. But there are several approaches to address this issue beyond relying on herbicides like glyphosate (it will kill all plants that do not have the herbicide tolerant trait), which is wholly unsuitable for a nation comprising so many small farms cultivating a diverse range of crops. Mechanical weeding using animal-drawn or tractor-powered implements for larger farms is one solution, and there are several agronomic techniques that can help suppress weeds and reduce labour needs: crop rotation disrupts weed lifecycles, higher planting densities shade out weeds, proper fertilisation gives crops a competitive advantage and use of cover crops and mulches can suppress weed growth. Even here, however, there are cynical attempts to get farmers to change their cultivation methods (with no tangible financial benefits) and move away from traditional systems. In the article The Ox Fall Down: Path Breaking and Treadmills in Indian Cotton Agriculture, for instance, we see farmers being nudged away from traditional planting methods and pushed towards a method inconducive to oxen ploughing but very conducive for herbicide-dependent weed management. That article notes the huge growth potential for herbicides in India, something companies like Bayer are keen to capitalise on. Wiebusch talks of India reaching ‚Äòdeveloped status‚Äô. But what does the type of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô he proposes entail? We need only look around us for the answer: decision-making centralised in the hands of government and corporate entities, traditional local governance structures weakened and standardised, top-down policies and corporate consolidation through mergers and acquisitions with local independent enterprises struggling to compete. Consolidated corporations have greater lobbying power to shape regulations in their favour, further entrenching their market position. In other words, political centralisation and corporate consolidation are often intertwined. Centralised political structures tend to align with the interests of large, consolidated corporations, and both centralised governments and large corporations exert greater control over resources. This dual process has led to reduced economic diversity and resilience, weakened local communities and traditions, increased vulnerability to systemic shocks and diminished democratic participation. ‚ÄòDeveloped status‚Äô also means accelerated urbanisation, land amalgamations for industrial-scale farming and depopulation of the countryside. And it means farmers being encouraged to grow cash crops for export based on trade policies that work in favour of big landowners and heavily subsidised Western agriculture. As mentioned earlier, it has been estimated that between 2016 and 2030, globally, urban areas will have tripled in size, expanding into cropland and undermining the productivity of agricultural systems. Around 60 per cent of the world‚Äôs cropland lies on the outskirts of cities. This land is, on average, twice as productive as land elsewhere on the globe. As cities expand, millions of small-scale farmers are displaced. These farmers produce the majority of food in the Global South and are key to global food security. A combination of urbanisation and policies deliberately designed to displace the food-producing peasantry will serve to boost the corporate takeover of India‚Äôs agrifood sector. This is what Bayer calls ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô. But none of this is inevitable. Many of us know what the response should be: prioritising sustainable, locally appropriate solutions and restoring food sovereignty and the economic vibrancy of rural communities; focusing on holistic human well-being rather than narrow economic metrics of ‚Äògrowth‚Äô; preserving traditional knowledge that underpins highly productive farming practices for the benefit of farmers, consumer health and the environment; and empowering communities through localism and decentralisation rather than creating state-corporate dependency. Such solutions are markedly different from those characterised by rural population displacement, the subjugation of peoples and nature, nutrient-poor diets, degraded on-farm and off-farm ecosystems and corporate consolidation. There are alternative visions for the future, alternative visions of human development. But these do not boost corporate margins or control and do not fit the hegemonic narrative of what passes for ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô. However, it is concerning that what Bayer advocates is regarded as the common sense of the age. The ultimate coup d‚Äô√©tat by the transnational agribusiness conglomerates is that state officials, scientists and journalists take as given that profit-driven Fortune 500 corporations have a legitimate claim to be custodians of natural assets. These corporations have convinced so many that they have the ultimate legitimacy to own, control and manage what is essentially humanity‚Äôs commonwealth. Water, food, soil, land and agriculture have been handed over to powerful transnational corporations to milk for profit as though they are serving the needs of humanity. Corporations which promote industrial agriculture have embedded themselves deeply within the policy-making machinery on both national and international levels. The ultimate intertwining of political centralisation and corporate consolidation. It should be clear by now that the issues raised in this book transcend a narrow analysis of the food system. There has been much discussion about social control, technocracy and even transhumanism. And this chapter is no different. It is essential to explore broader power dynamics in order to gain a clearer understanding of the global food regime and the corporations and interests behind it. Power is increasingly concentrated in the hands of an elite that wields its considerable wealth, influence and technological advancements to dominate both resources and populations, profoundly shaping the fabric of our lives. In recent years, we have seen the nudging (manipulating) of populations to accept a ‚Äònew normal‚Äô based on, among other things, a climate emergency narrative, pandemic preparedness tyranny, unaccountable AI, synthetic ‚Äòfood‚Äô and farmerless farms. Whether it involves a ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô, an ‚Äòenergy transition‚Äô, 15-minute cities or some other benign-sounding term, all this is to be determined by a supranational state-corporate ‚Äòstakeholder‚Äô elite with ordinary people sidelined in the process. An undemocratic agenda designed to place restrictions on individual liberty, marking a dramatic shift towards authoritarianism. In the 1980s, to help legitimise the deregulation-privatisation neoliberal globalisation agenda, government and media instigated an ideological onslaught on populations, driving home the primacy of ‚Äòfree enterprise‚Äô, individual rights and responsibility and emphasising a shift away from the role of the state, trade unions and the collective in society. We are currently seeing another ideological shift: individual rights and freedoms are said to undermine the wider needs of society and the planet; in a stark turnaround, personal freedom is now said to pose a threat to national security, public health or the climate. As in the 1980s, this messaging is being driven by an economic impulse. This time, the collapsing neoliberal project. In the UK, poverty is increasing, food banks are now a necessary part of life for millions. Indeed, the poorest families are enduring a ‚Äòfrightening‚Äô collapse in living standards, resulting in life-changing and life-limiting poverty. In the US, it was reported in 2023 that around 30 million low-income people are on the edge of a ‚Äòhunger cliff‚Äô as a portion of their federal food assistance is taken away. In 2021, it was estimated that one in eight children were going hungry in the US. In April 2023, it was reported that small businesses were filing for bankruptcy in the US at a record rate. Image is from the Bank of England website The Bank of England‚Äôs chief economist, Huw Pill, says that people should ‚Äòaccept‚Äô being poorer. This is similar to the response of Rob Kapito, co-founder of the world‚Äôs biggest asset management firm, BlackRock. In 2022, the unimaginably rich and entitled Kapito said that a ‚Äúvery entitled‚Äù generation of (ordinary working) people who have never had to sacrifice would soon have to face shortages for the first time in their lives. While business as usual prevails in Kapito‚Äôs world of privilege and that of major arms, energy, pharmaceuticals and food companies, whose megarich owners continue to rake in massive profits, Kapito and Pill tell ordinary people to get used to poverty and the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô as if we are ‚Äòall in it together‚Äô ‚Äî billionaires and working class alike. They conveniently used COVID and the situation in Ukraine as cover for the collapsing neoliberalism. But this is part of the hegemonic agenda that seeks to ensure that the establishment‚Äôs world view is the accepted cultural norm. And anyone who challenges this world view ‚Äî whether it involves, for instance, questioning climate alarmism, the ‚Äònew normal‚Äô, the nature of the economic crisis, the mainstream COVID narrative or the official stance on Ukraine and Russia ‚Äî is regarded as a spreader of misinformation and the ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô. If we turn to New Zealand, we could see this in action during and after the COVID event. The country‚Äôs former prime minister Jacinda Ardern grabbed the global limelight a few years ago, making headlines by stating she wanted to put ‚Äòkindness‚Äô into politics. In 2019, Foreign Policy, a publication closely associated with the Atlantic Council and the US State Department, published the article ‚ÄòThe Kindness Quotient‚Äô, a glowing promotion of Ardern. The strategic marketing of Ardern in various publications focused on her likeability, pro-environment stance, compassionate values and collaborative nature. To further appeal to liberal sentiments, she was said to represent everything Trump is not. Ardern belongs to a set of global leaders who were groomed for their positions through the World Economic Forum (WEF) Young Global Leaders Programme. Yes, that WEF ‚Äî the elitist organisation where hard-nose billionaires and their handmaidens gather to set out policies aligned with powerful business interests. The charm offensive that Ardern‚Äôs promoters undertook was an investment. She delivered on COVID by implementing lockdowns and restrictions without question. Arden stated in her speech to the UN in September 2022: ‚ÄúAs leaders, we are rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as hostile to values of free speech that we value so highly.‚Äù She went on to say: ‚ÄúHow do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist? How do you ensure the human rights of others are upheld as they are subjected to hateful and dangerous ideology.‚Äù She continued by saying free speech (that the authorities disagree with) can be a weapon of war. During COVID, Ardern urged citizens to trust the government and its agencies for all information and stated: ‚ÄúOtherwise, dismiss anything else. We will continue to be your single source of truth.‚Äù Throughout that period, in the US, Fauci presented himself as ‚Äòthe science‚Äô. In New Zealand, Ardern‚Äôs government was ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô. It was similar in countries across the world. Different figures but the same approach. When anyone in power or any institution lays claim to ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô, history shows we are on a slippery slope to silencing thought and dissent that we disagree with. Like other political leaders, during COVID, Ardern clamped down on civil liberties with the full force of state violence on hand to ensure compliance with ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô. Clearly, Ardern was not alone here. Trudeau, the Biden administration and others have continued to display Orwellian undertones as they spoke of the need to challenge ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô and those who question ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô. The thin end of a very wide authoritarian wedge. It seems, especially post-COVID, critical analysis and open debate are fine as long as those involved keep within the framework of what is deemed supportive of official narratives. We are often urged to ‚Äòtrust the science‚Äô and accept that the ‚Äòscience is decided‚Äô on various issues. We heard this on the COVID issue, when we were told governments are ‚Äòfollowing the science‚Äô, while they and the big tech companies censored world-renowned scientists and opposing views and opinions. In ‚Äòfollowing the science‚Äô, conflicts of interest were rife and notions of objectivity, open disclosure and organised scepticism ‚Äî core values of scientific endeavour ‚Äî were trampled on. Those who questioned the COVID narrative were smeared, shut down and censored, the playbook of big agribusiness ‚Äî manipulating science, smearing critics, derailing policies that threaten its interests and claiming that ‚Äòthe science is decided‚Äô on genetically modified organisms ‚Äî and authoritarian governments. Is anyone who questions and wants a more open debate on climate change or whether such change is occurring as stated or will lead to ‚Äòextinction‚Äô to be charged with disseminating misinformation? Is questioning the orthodoxy of the zero-carbon policy agenda to be shut down and those who challenge it to be labelled ‚Äòextremists‚Äô. Ardern asked: ‚ÄúHow do you tackle climate change if people believe it does not exist?‚Äù But it is also pertinent to ask: How do you tackle it if you accept it exists? Even if we accept humanity is in trouble and facing a genuine climate emergency, people should at least be able to question the current ‚Äògreen‚Äô agenda based on a ‚Äòstakeholder capitalism‚Äô strategy (governments and others facilitating the needs of private capital) that has co-opted genuine concerns about the environment to pursue new multi-billion-dollar global investment opportunities (described in the 2020 report Nature for Sale by Friends of the Earth). If you read that report, you might conclude that we are witnessing a type of green imperialism that is using genuine concerns about the environment to pursue a familiar agenda of extractivism, colonisation and commodification. The same old mindset, greenwashed and rolled out for public consumption. Ardern‚Äôs utterances on the dangers of free speech, the singularity of ‚Äòtruth‚Äô and the implicit shift towards authoritarianism must be viewed within the context of managing an economic crisis. What she was saying revealed how the financial and political elites based on Wall Street, in Washington and in the City of London were thinking. The authorities fear blowback in terms of mass dissent and uprisings. A few years ago, Liz Truss, then UK prime minister, wanted to place ‚Äòlegal curbs‚Äô on striking trade unions. There is also the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts (PCSC) Act 2022, which may undermine the right to protest. It therefore comes as no surprise that, today, individual rights and free speech are under threat. The ultimate control mechanism would be linking central bank digital currencies to personal carbon footprints (including eating habits), spending and dissent in an age of economic turmoil. Trudeau might have given the game away on that when he hit protesting truckers where it hurt most ‚Äî restricting access to bank accounts. How long before ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô and challenging ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô becomes thought crime and ‚Äî as Jacinda Ardern might put it ‚Äî ‚Äòcruel to be kind‚Äô actions are taken against those who challenge dominant state-corporate narratives? Well, not long because we have already witnessed it during the last few years. A doubling down since COVID. Tyranny is the type of ‚Äòkindness‚Äô we don‚Äôt need. The term ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô was popularised by Margaret Thatcher during the UK miners‚Äô strike in 1984-85 to describe the striking miners. But it is a notion with which Britain‚Äôs rulers have regarded protest movements and uprisings down the centuries. From the Peasants‚Äô Revolt in 1381 to the Levellers and Diggers (who are discussed in the final chapter) in the 17th century, it is a concept associated with anyone or any group that challenges the existing social order and the interests of the ruling class. John Ball, a radical priest, addressed the Peasants‚Äô Revolt rebels with the following words: ‚ÄúGood friends, matters cannot go well in England until all things be held in common; when there shall be neither vassals nor lords; when the lords shall be no more masters than ourselves.‚Äù The revolt was suppressed. John Ball was captured and hung, drawn and quartered. Part of the blood-soaked history of the British ruling class. Later on, the 17th-century Diggers‚Äô movement wanted to create small, egalitarian rural communities and farm on common land that had been privatised by enclosures. The 1975 song ‚ÄòThe world Turned Upside Down‚Äô by Leon Rosselson commemorates the Diggers. His lyrics describe the aims and plight of the movement. In Rosselson‚Äôs words, the Diggers were dispossessed via theft and murder but reclaimed what was theirs only to be violently put down. Little surprise then that, in the 1980s, Margaret Thatcher used the full force of state machinery to defeat the country‚Äôs most powerful trade union, the shock troops of the labour movement, the National Union of Mineworkers ‚Äî ‚Äòthe enemy within‚Äô. She needed to do this to open the gates for capital to profit from the subsequent deindustrialisation of much of the UK and the dismantling of large parts of the welfare state. And the result? A hollowed-out, debt-bloated economy, the destruction of the social fabric of entire communities and the great financial Ponzi scheme ‚Äî the ‚Äòmiracle‚Äô of deregulated finance ‚Äî that now teeters on the brink of collapse, leading the likes of Kapito and Pill to tell the public to get ready to become poor. And now, in 2024, the latest version of the ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô is anyone who disseminates ‚Äòmisinformation‚Äô ‚Äî anything that challenges the official state-corporate narrative. So, this time, one goal is to have a fully controlled (censored) internet. For instance, US Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) awarded Accrete a contract for Argus to detect disinformation threats from social media. Argus is AI software that analyses social media data to predict emergent narratives and generate intelligence reports at a speed and scale to help neutralise viral disinformation threats. Accrete AI is a leading dual-use enterprise AI company. It deployed its AI Argus software for open-source threat detection with the US Department of Defense in 2022. In a press release, Prashant Bhuyan, founder and CEO of Accrete, boasted: ‚ÄúSocial media is widely recognised as an unregulated environment where adversaries routinely exploit reasoning vulnerabilities and manipulate behaviour through the intentional spread of disinformation. USSOCOM is at the tip of the spear in recognising the critical need to identify and analytically predict social media narratives at an embryonic stage before those narratives evolve and gain traction. Accrete is proud to support USSOCOM‚Äôs mission.‚Äù ‚ÄçThis is about predicting wrong think on social media. But control over the internet is just part of a wider programme of establishment domination, surveillance and dealing with protest and dissent. The online article How the Government Weaponizes Surveillance to Silence Its Critics notes that, on any given day, the average person in the US is monitored, spied on and tracked in more than 20 different ways. The authors of the article ask us to consider some of the ways the US government is weaponising its surveillance technologies to flag citizens as a threat to national security, whether or not they have done anything wrong ‚Äî from flagging citizens as a danger based on their feelings, phone and movements to their spending activities, social media activities, political views and correspondence. The elite has determined that the existential threat is you. The article Costs of War: Peterloo, written by UK Veterans for Peace member Aly Renwick, details the history of the brutal suppression of protesters by Britain‚Äôs rulers. He also strips away any notion that some may have of a benign, present-day ruling elite with democratic leanings. The leopard has not changed its spots. As we saw during COVID, the thinking is that hard-won rights must be curtailed, freedom of association is reckless, free thinking is dangerous, dissent is to be stamped on, impartial science is a threat and free speech is deadly. Government is ‚Äòthe truth‚Äô, Fauci (or some similar figure) is ‚Äòthe science‚Äô and censorship is for your own good. None of this was justified. It only begins to make sense if we regard the COVID restrictions in terms of trying to deal with an economic crisis by closing down the global economy under cover of a public health crisis. The economic crisis is making many people poorer, so they must be controlled, monitored and subjugated. The transitions mentioned at the start of this chapter along with the surveillance agenda (together known as the ‚ÄòGreat Reset‚Äô) are being accelerated at this time of economic crisis when countless millions across the West are being impoverished. The collapsing US-led financial system is resulting in an interrelated global debt, inflation and ‚Äòausterity‚Äô crisis and the biggest transfer of wealth to the rich in history. Integral to this is the ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô and the ‚Äòclimate emergency‚Äô narrative, an intertwined commentary that has been carefully constructed and promoted (see the work of investigative journalist Cory Morningstar), and net-zero ideology tied to carbon farming and carbon trading. The ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô involves locking farmers (at least those farmers who will remain in farming) further into a corporate-controlled agriculture that extracts wealth and serves the market needs of global corporations, carbon trading Ponzi schemes and institutional investors and speculators with no connection to farming who regard agriculture, food commodities and agricultural land as mere financial assets. These farmers will be reduced to corporate profit-extracting agents who bear all of the risks. This predatory commercialisation of the countryside attempts to use flawed premises and climate alarmism to legitimise the roll-out of technologies to supposedly deliver us all from climate breakdown and Malthusian catastrophe. Meanwhile, a wealthy elite increasingly funds science, determines what should be studied, how it should be studied and how the findings are disseminated and how the technology produced is to be used. This elite has the power to shut down genuine debate and to smear and censor others who question the dominant narrative. The prevailing thinking is that the problems humanity face are to be solved through technical innovation determined by plutocrats and consolidated corporate power. This haughty mindset (or outright arrogance) leads to and is symptomatic of an authoritarianism that seeks to impose a range of technologies on humanity with no democratic oversight. This includes self-transmitting vaccines, the genetic engineering of plants and humans, synthetic food, geoengineering and transhumanism. And in India, as we have seen, it involves the imposition of policies in agriculture that, too, also lack any form of democratic oversight or debate. During the farmers‚Äô protest in 2020-21, influential media and commentators wasted no time in attempting to portray farmers as ‚Äòanti-national‚Äô and the ‚Äòenemy within‚Äô. What we see is a misguided eco-modernist paradigm that concentrates power and privileges techno-scientific expertise (a form of technocratic exceptionalism). At the same time, historical power relations (often rooted in agriculture and colonialism) and their legacies within and between societies across the world are conveniently ignored and depoliticised. Technology is not the cure-all for the destructive impacts of poverty, inequality, dispossession, imperialism or class exploitation. When it comes to the technologies and policies being rolled out in the agriculture sector, these phenomena will be reinforced and further entrenched ‚Äî and that includes illness and poor health, which have markedly increased as a result of the modern food we eat and the agrochemicals and practices already used by the corporations pushing for the ‚Äòfood transition‚Äô. However, that then opens up other money-spinning techno-fix opportunities in the life sciences sector for investors like BlackRock that invest in both agriculture and pharmaceuticals. But in a neoliberal privatised economy that has often facilitated the rise of members of the controlling wealthy elite, it is reasonable to assume that its members possess certain assumptions of how the world works and should continue to work: a world based on deregulation with limited oversight and the hegemony of private capital and a world led by private individuals like Bill Gates who think they know best. Whether through, for instance, the patenting of life forms, carbon trading, entrenching market (corporate) dependency or land investments, their eco-modern policies serve as cover for generating and amassing further wealth and for cementing their control. It should come as little surprise that powerful people who have contempt for democratic principles (and by implication, ordinary people) believe they have some divine right to undermine food security, close down debate, enrich themselves further courtesy of their technologies and policies and gamble with humanity‚Äôs future. But the powers that be fear that the masses might once again pick up their pitchforks and revolt. They are adamant that the peasants must know their place. However, the flame of protest and dissent from centuries past still inspires and burns bright. Economist Prof Michael Hudson stated in 2014: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs by agriculture and control of the food supply that American diplomacy has been able to control most of the Third World. The World Bank‚Äôs geopolitical lending strategy has been to turn countries into food deficit areas by convincing them to grow cash crops ‚Äî plantation export crops ‚Äî not to feed themselves with their own food crops.‚Äù In 2019, Hudson described how debt, sanctions and the US-controlled international monetary system had backed Venezuelan president Maduro into a corner. Venezuela had become an oil monoculture, with revenue having been spent largely on importing food and other necessities, which it could have produced itself. In this respect, Word Trade Organization (WTO) policies and directives, debt and US-supported geopolitical lending strategies have compelled many countries in the Global South to eradicate food self-sufficiency and undermine their own food security. The control of global agriculture has been a tentacle of US capitalism‚Äôs geopolitical strategy. The Green Revolution was exported courtesy of oil-rich interests, and poorer nations adopted Western agri-capital‚Äôs chemical- and oil-dependent model of agriculture that required loans for inputs and related infrastructure development. It entailed trapping nations into a globalised system of debt bondage, rigged trade relations and a system vulnerable to oil price shocks (this was touched on in the final chapter of Sickening Profits). In his book The Unsettling of America (1977), Wendell Berry criticises the US Department of Agriculture for adopting a doctrine that treats food as an instrument of foreign political and economic speculation. Berry argues that treating food as a weapon ultimately serves the interests of large agribusiness corporations rather than farmers or consumers. He sees the weaponisation of food as part of a larger problem where agriculture is divorced from its cultural and ecological roots, leading to numerous negative consequences. Berry‚Äôs book discusses how modern agriculture has fostered a disconnect between people and the land. He laments that farming has been reduced to a mere business venture rather than a way of life that nurtures community and culture. A business venture and a geopolitical weapon. Something not lost on environmentalist Vandana Shiva who does not hesitate to label agrochemical companies as a poison cartel. She emphasises that this designation stems not only from the harmful effects of its chemicals on the food system but also from the historical connections of corporations like Bayer and BASF to warfare and chemical weapons. These companies have roots in producing toxic substances used during conflicts, including World War I and II, where they manufactured chemical agents such as chlorine gas and Zyklon B, the latter infamously used in Nazi gas chambers. These practices reflect a broader underlining (historical) pattern of exploitation and violence in the food system that undermines both human health and ecological integrity. Major agribusiness companies are deeply embedded in supranational policymaking machinery that allows them to draw up policies to serve their own interests. For instance, Monsanto played a key part in drafting the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights to create seed monopolies, and the global food processing industry (Cargill) had a leading role in shaping the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures. The powerful agribusiness lobby has secured privileged access to policy makers to ensure its model of agriculture prevails. And those same companies also profit from war and sovereign debt traps to gain access to markets (see, for instance, Sowing the Seeds of Famine in Ethiopia by Michel Chossudovsky). Hit lists, the corruption of science, profiteering and the infiltration of regulatory bodies aside (the list could go on), food cultivation ‚Äî an endeavour that at its core seeks to nourish and sustain life ‚Äî has been hijacked and weaponised to coerce, control and suck away life from nature and people. And Bayer talks about ‚Äòbackwardness‚Äô, as if any of the above is progressive. But few illusions are as pervasive and pernicious as the ideology of ‚Äòprogress‚Äô and ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô that hides behind corporate lobbyist soundbites about agribusiness and its money-spinning inputs being needed to prevent mass starvation. This ideology, propped up by the twin pillars of techno-solutionism and technocracy has become the unquestioned truth of the age, a secular religion that promises salvation through the relentless march of technology and the wisdom of experts. Writer Paul Cudenec says that ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ is the destruction of nature, now seen as a mere resource to be used for development or as an empty undeveloped space in which development could, should and, ultimately, must take place. It is the destruction of natural human communities, whose self-sufficiency gets in the way of the advance of development, and of authentic human culture and traditional values, which are incompatible with the dogma and domination of development.‚Äù Cudenec argues that those behind ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô have been destroying everything of real value in our natural world and our human societies in the pursuit of personal wealth and power. Moreover, they have concealed this crime behind all the positive-sounding rhetoric associated with development on every level. Indeed, the notion that human society is on an inevitable trajectory of improvement, driven by technological innovation and guided by technocratic elites, is perhaps the most insidious myth of our time. This narrative of perpetual progress is a convenient smokescreen, obscuring the stark realities of environmental degradation, social inequality and spiritual impoverishment that characterise so-called advanced civilisation. At the heart of this ideology lies the naive belief in techno-solutionism ‚Äî the misguided faith that every problem, no matter how complex or deeply rooted in social and political structures, can be solved with the right technological fix. This reductionist worldview reduces the human experience to a series of technical challenges, eagerly awaiting the next groundbreaking innovation to set things right. Agriculture? Just invent more data-gathering apps. Poverty? Develop an app for that. This simplistic approach not only fails to address the root causes of our predicaments but actively distracts us from the necessary work of systemic change and collective action. Hand in hand with techno-solutionism marches technocracy ‚Äî the idea that society would be best governed by the rich, technical experts and engineers rather than elected representatives or, just imagine, ordinary people! This elitist vision of governance places undue faith in the objectivity and benevolence of a technocratic class, ignoring the fact that these so-called experts are just as susceptible to self-interest as any other group. The technocratic mindset reduces the vibrant reality of human society to a series of data points and algorithms, treating citizens as variables in a grand social engineering experiment. A worldview that values efficiency over empathy, optimisation over justice and control over freedom. In this brave new world, the nuances of culture, the wisdom of tradition and the unpredictability of human nature are seen as inconvenient obstacles to be overcome rather than essential aspects of the human experience. Proponents of this ideology of progress would have us believe that we‚Äôre living in the best of all possible worlds ‚Äî or at least on the path to it with the proliferation of gadgets as irrefutable evidence of our ascent. But this narrative of continuous improvement conveniently ignores the widening wealth gap, corporate corruption, the epidemic of mental health issues, the erosion of community ties and a globalised food system that results in all manner of illness and environmental degradation. The obsession with technological progress and economic growth has come at a tremendous cost. Elite interests have sacrificed the health of the planet, the well-being of countless species and our own connection to the natural world on the altar of ‚Äòdevelopment‚Äô. They traded meaningful work and genuine human connections for the hollow notion of convenience and efficiency. The quantifiable trumps the qualitative, reducing the human experience to a series of metrics. The ideology of progress serves as a powerful tool for maintaining the status quo. By perpetuating the myth that our current corrupt system is the pinnacle of human achievement, or at least the best we can hope for (there is no alternative!) stifles imagination and is meant to induce apathy and demotivate the masses in striving to bring about meaningful change. And those who dare to question the wisdom of endless growth or propose alternative models of social organisation are censored or dismissed as naive idealists or dangerous radicals. The tech giants and corporations that benefit most from this ideology have become the new high priests of our age, peddling their digital opiates and shiny gadgets as the path to a better future. They promise connection but deliver isolation, offer information but breed confusion and pledge empowerment while tightening the public noose of surveillance. Ordinary people need to reclaim their agency, get off their cell phones and reimagine their relationship with technology, viewing it as a tool to be wielded judiciously rather than a force that shapes our destiny. We need to forge a new path that values human flourishing over ‚Äògrowth‚Äô, that prioritises ecological harmony over technological domination and that recognises the inherent worth of all beings ‚Äî not just those deemed productive by the economic system. This means challenging the state-corporate-financial- digital elite, who use their wealth, policies and technologies to wage a class war on ordinary people, while reclaiming the power to shape our societies through collective action. It means reevaluating our definition of progress, moving beyond simplistic metrics of economic growth to consider the true measures of human and ecological well-being. And it means appreciating the complexity of the world, recognising that not every problem has a technological solution and that some of the most valuable aspects of human existence cannot be quantified or optimised. We find ourselves at a critical juncture where the very foundations of our food systems and, indeed, our relationship with the natural world are being systematically dismantled and reconstructed to serve the interests of a unimaginably rich elite. As we stand on the precipice of a brave new world dominated by genetically engineered crops, lab-grown meat and AI-driven farming, it is imperative that we pause and critically examine the path we are being herded down. The time has come to resist and reject the unchecked corporatisation and mechanisation of our food and, indeed, our lives. The Green Revolution, once hailed as the saviour of the ‚Äòdeveloping world‚Äô, has instead trapped millions of farmers in cycles of debt and dependency, while reducing the nutritional value of food and decimating biodiversity. Now, we are told that the solution to current problems lies in even more technology ‚Äî gene editing, precision agriculture and artificial intelligence. But this is merely doubling down on a failed paradigm. These ‚Äòsolutions‚Äô are not designed to address the root causes of our food crisis, but rather to further consolidate control over the food system in the hands of a few powerful corporations. Consider the push for genetically modified organisms and the new wave of gene-edited crops. Proponents claim these technologies will increase yields and reduce pesticide use. Yet, decades of cultivation of genetically modified organisms have shown us that these promises are hollow. Instead, we have seen the rise of superweeds, increased pesticide use and the erosion of seed sovereignty as farmers become beholden to patent-holding corporations. Similarly, the drive towards ‚Äòsmart‚Äô farming and precision agriculture is often presented as a path to sustainability. In reality, it‚Äôs a trojan horse for increased corporate control and farmer disempowerment. As farms become more reliant on proprietary software, expensive machinery and data-driven decision making, traditional farming knowledge is devalued, and farmers are reduced to mere operators in a system they no longer fully understand or control. The solution lies in a return to human-scale agriculture, rooted in agroecological principles. This is not a romanticised view of the past but a forward-thinking approach that recognises the wisdom embedded in traditional farming practices while selectively incorporating appropriate technologies. Agroecology works with nature rather than against it, fostering biodiversity, building soil health and creating resilient food systems. The push for lab-grown meat and ultra-processed, plant-based alternatives is not about sustainability or animal welfare but about wresting control of protein production from farmers and placing it in the hands of tech companies and their investors. These products, often marketed as eco-friendly solutions, are in reality energy-intensive, highly processed foods that further disconnect us from the natural world and our food sources. In the face of this techno-industrial onslaught, we must advocate for food sovereignty ‚Äî the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems. This means resisting the corporatisation of our food supply, supporting local food systems and preserving the diversity of crops and culinary traditions that have nourished humanity for millennia. In attempting to shape the future, we can indeed look to the past for inspiration and reclaim part of history by drawing from the radical vision and actions of ‚Äòthe Diggers‚Äô movement (1649-1651). In the annals of agrarian history, one particular movement has left a profound impact on the collective imagination of food sovereignty advocates. The Diggers in 17th century England were led by the visionary Gerrard Winstanley. This radical group emerged during a period of intense social and political upheaval, offering a revolutionary perspective on land ownership and food production that continues to resonate with modern struggles for food justice. The Diggers, also known as the True Levellers, arose in 1649, a time when England was reeling from the aftermath of civil war. Winstanley and his followers dared to imagine a different world. The group challenged the very foundations of the emerging capitalist system and the enclosure movement that was rapidly privatising previously common lands. But Winstanley‚Äôs vision was not merely theoretical. On 1 April 1649, the Diggers began their most famous action, occupying St. George‚Äôs Hill in Surrey, where they established a commune, cultivating the land collectively and distributing food freely to all who needed it. This act of direct action was a powerful demonstration of their philosophy in practice. As Winstanley declared: ‚ÄúThe earth was made to be a common treasury for all, not a private treasury for some.‚Äù The Diggers, true to their name, began their movement by literally digging up unused common lands and planting crops. According to Professor Justin Champion, they planted ‚Äúpeas and carrots and pulses‚Äù and let their cows graze on the fields. While the Diggers saw their actions as relatively harmless (Champion compares it to having an allotment), local property owners viewed it as a serious threat, likening it to ‚Äúvillage terrorism‚Äù, according to Champion. The local landowners called in troops to suppress these actions. Despite their relatively small numbers and short-lived experiments, which spread across parts of England, Champion suggests that the Diggers posed a significant ideological threat to the existing social order, challenging notions of private property and social hierarchy. Winstanley declared: ‚ÄúThose that Buy and Sell Land, and are landlords, have got it either by Oppression, or Murther, or Theft‚Äù. He added: ‚ÄúThe Work we are going about is this, To dig up Georges-Hill and the waste Ground thereabouts, and to Sow Corn, and to eat our bread together by the sweat of our brows. And the First Reason is this, That we may work in righteousness, and lay the Foundation of making the Earth a Common Treasury for All, both Rich and Poor, That every one that is born in the land, may be fed by the Earth his Mother that brought him forth, according to the Reason that rules in the Creation.‚Äù The backlash from local landlords was systematic. The Diggers faced beatings and arson, forcing them to move from St George‚Äôs Hill to a second site in Cobham, until they were finally driven off the land entirely. Writing in 1972 in his book The World Turned Upside Down, Christopher Hill, a prominent historian of the English Civil War period, suggested that the Diggers‚Äô influence was more widespread than just their most famous colony at St. George‚Äôs Hill. He argued that from Nottinghamshire and Northamptonshire to Gloucestershire and Kent, Digger influence spread all over southern and central England. While the actual number of people involved in Digger experiments was relatively small (estimated at 100-200 people across England), their ideas spread more widely through pamphlets and word of mouth. This widespread influence, as described by Hill, suggests that the Diggers‚Äô ideas resonated with people across a significant portion of England, even if actual Digger colonies were few in number. The Diggers were a radical, biblically inspired movement that practically implemented their beliefs about common ownership of land, provoking strong opposition from the established landowners despite their generally peaceful methods. The St. George‚Äôs Hill experiment represented a radical alternative to the prevailing economic and social order. It was an early example of what we might today call a food sovereignty project, emphasising local control over food production and distribution. In today‚Äôs era of industrial agriculture and corporate food systems, the Diggers‚Äô ideas remain highly significant. Their resistance to the enclosure of common lands in the 17th century mirrors today‚Äôs struggles against corporate land grabs ‚Äî and the colonising actions that underpin the likes of Bayer‚Äôs corporate jargon about the unlocking of ‚Äòbusiness growth‚Äô, ‚Äòdriving change management‚Äô, ‚Äòdriving market share‚Äô and ‚Äòcreating business value‚Äô ‚Äî as well as the privatisation of seeds and genetic resources. The consolidation of the global agri-food chain in the hands of a few powerful corporations represents a modern form of enclosure, concentrating control over food production and distribution in ways that would have been all too familiar to Winstanley and his followers. The Diggers‚Äô emphasis on local, community-controlled food production offers a stark alternative to the industrial agriculture model promoted by agribusiness giants and their allies in institutions like the World Bank and the WTO Where the dominant paradigm prioritises large-scale monocultures, global supply chains and market-driven food security, the Diggers‚Äô vision aligns more closely with concepts of food sovereignty and agroecology. Food sovereignty, a concept developed by the international peasant movement La Via Campesina, shares much with the Diggers‚Äô philosophy. Both emphasise the right of communities to define their own food and agriculture systems. The Diggers‚Äô legacy can be seen in various contemporary movements challenging the corporate food regime. From La Via Campesina‚Äôs global struggle for peasant rights to local community garden initiatives and the work of the Agrarian Trust in the US (which provides good insight into the Diggers and their continued relevance in The Diggers Today: Enclosure, Manure and Resistance), we see echoes of the Diggers‚Äô vision. Modern projects to create community-owned farms, seed banks and food cooperatives can be seen as spiritual descendants of the Diggers‚Äô movement, aiming to reclaim food production from corporate control and put it back in the hands of communities. However, realising the Diggers‚Äô vision in the current context faces significant obstacles. The influence of agribusiness conglomerates over key institutions and policymaking bodies presents a formidable challenge. From the World Bank to national agriculture ministries, as this book has made clear, corporate interests often shape policies that prioritise industrial agriculture and global markets over local food systems. International trade agreements and MoUs, often negotiated with minimal public scrutiny, frequently benefit large agribusiness at the expense of small farmers and local food sovereignty. Moreover, proponents of industrial agriculture often argue that it is the only way to feed the world. This narrative, however, ignores the environmental and social costs of this model, as well as the proven productivity of small-scale, agroecological farming methods. The Diggers didn‚Äôt just theorise about an alternative society; they attempted to build it by taking direct action, occupying land and implementing their vision of communal agriculture. The Diggers also understood that changing the food system required challenging broader power structures. Today‚Äôs food sovereignty movements similarly recognise the need for systemic change, addressing issues of land rights, trade policies and economic justice alongside agricultural practices. In this era of corporate-dominated agriculture, the Diggers‚Äô vision of a ‚Äúcommon treasury for all‚Äù remains as radical and necessary as ever. By reclaiming the commons, promoting agroecological practices and building food sovereignty, ordinary people can work towards a world where food is truly a common treasury for all. The Diggers recognised that true freedom and equality could not be achieved without addressing the fundamental question of who controls the land and the means of production. This understanding is crucial in the current context, where corporate control over the food system extends from land, seeds and inputs to distribution and retail. The Diggers‚Äô vision also challenges us to rethink our relationship with the land and with each other. In a world increasingly dominated by individualism and market relations, the emphasis on communal ownership and collective labour offers a radical alternative. The Diggers‚Äô legacy challenges us to think beyond the confines of the prevailing food regime, to envision and create a world where food and land are not commodities to be bought and sold but common resources to be shared and stewarded for the benefit of all. Their vision of a world where ‚Äúthe earth becomes a common treasury again‚Äù is not a quaint historical curiosity, but a vital and necessary alternative to the destructive practices of those who dominate the current food system. It is noteworthy that the annual Wigan Diggers Festival celebrates the life and ideas of Wigan born and bred Gerrard Winstanley and the Diggers‚Äô Movement (see Wigan Diggers‚Äô Festival). But let us finish with Leon Rosselson‚Äôs song lyrics from his 1975 song in reference to the Diggers‚Äô movement (Billy Bragg‚Äôs version can be found here on YouTube). In sixteen forty-nine/To St. George‚Äôs Hill A ragged band they called the Diggers/Came to show the people‚Äôs will They defied the landlords/They defied the laws They were the dispossessed reclaiming what was theirs We come in peace they said/To dig and sow We come to work the lands in common/And to make the waste grounds grow This earth divided/We will mak–µ whole So it will be/A common treasury for all Th–µ sin of property/We do disdain No man has any right to buy and sell/The earth for private gain By theft and murder/They took the land Now everywhere the walls/Spring up at their command They make the laws/To chain us well The clergy dazzle us with heaven/Or they damn us into hell We will not worship/The God they serve The God of greed who feed the rich/While poor man starve We work we eat together/We need no swords We will not bow to masters/Or pay rent to the lords We are free men/Though we are poor You Diggers all stand up for glory/Stand up now From the men of property/The orders came They sent the hired men and troopers/To wipe out the Diggers‚Äô claim Tear down their cottages/Destroy their corn They were dispersed/Only the vision lingers on You poor take courage/You rich take care The earth was made a common treasury/For everyone to share All things in common/All people one We come in peace/The order came to cut them down Click the share button below to email/forward this article to your friends and colleagues.

With a net worth of over $420 billion, Elon Musk kicked off 2025 as the world's wealthiest individual, followed by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who had $233.5 billion, according to Forbes' latest billionaire rankings. President- Donald Trump's first buddy witnessed a jump of $91 billion in net worth since 1 December 2024, mainly due to SpaceX's new valuation of $350 billion. Forbes' ranking shows a noteworthy rise in the net worth of the top 10 wealthiest individuals, with their combined wealth reaching $1.9 trillion, up from $1.8 trillion in December. Here's a look at the top 10 wealthiest people in the world according to Forbes: Net worth: $421.2 billion With a net worth of $421.2 billion, Elon Musk topped the Forbes list. Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 and serves as its CEO, also heads Tesla and holds stakes in social media platform X, AI company xAI, and tunnelling firm Boring Co. He owns 13% of Tesla. Before launching SpaceX in 2002 and joining Tesla in 2004, Musk co-founded PayPal, which was later sold to eBay. Net worth: $233.5 billion With a net worth of $233.5 billion, Amazon founder and Executive Chair Jeff Bezos ranked second on the list. Bezos founded Amazon in 1994 as an online bookstore and later expanded into cloud computing, entertainment, and more. He also owns Blue Origin, a private space company he founded and has invested billions in. Amazon's stock rose by 5% in December 2024, adding around $10 billion to his wealth. Net worth: $209.7 billion Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who boasts a net worth of $209.7 billion ranked third on the list. He co-founded the company in 1977 and led as CEO until 2014. He now serves as chairman and CTO. Oracle‚Äôs stock dropped over 9% in December 2024, wiping out around $17 billion from his wealth - pushing him down to third spot from the second-richest. Net worth: $202.5 billion Mark Zuckerberg, founder, chairman, and CEO of Meta - the company that owns Facebook, the world's largest social media platform has a net worth of $202.5 billion according to Forbes. He owns about 13% of the company. His net worth rose by 3.8 billion USD in December 2024, driven by a 1.9% increase in Meta shares. Net worth: $168.8 billion Bernard Arnault who's the CEO and chairman of luxury goods giant LVMH has a net worth of $168.8 billion. LVMH's portfolio includes- Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Fendi, Celine, Kenzo, Tiffany, Bulgari, Loewe, TAG Heuer, Marc Jacobs, Sephora among others. Over the past month, his net worth rose by 8.5 billion USD, driven by a 7% increase in LVMH shares. Arnault was the world‚Äôs richest person for most of 2023 and part of 2024. Net worth: $156 billion Fueled by an 11% rally in Google parent Alphabet's stock price, Larry Page's net worth increased by $14 billion to $156 billion. Page cofounded Google with Sergey Brin in 1998 and served as CEO until 2001, and again from 2011 to 2015. He is now a board member of Google‚Äôs parent, Alphabet, and retains a controlling stake. Net worth: $149 billion Like his Google cofounder Larry Page, Sergey Brin's net worth also jumped $14.7 billion in the past month due to an increase in Alphabet‚Äôs stock price. This surge pushed him from 8th rank to 7th on the Forbes list of the world‚Äôs richest people. Net worth: $141.7 billion The Oracle of Omaha dropped from Rank 6 to Rank 8 after Berkshire Hathaway‚Äôs stock price slipped about 6% in December wiping off $8.9 billion from his net worth. Warren Buffett, storied for his value investment strategy owns major businesses such as insurer Geico, battery maker Duracell, and fast-food chain Dairy Queen. Net worth: 124.3 billion Steve Ballmer, a former classmate of Bill Gates at Harvard, was Microsoft's CEO from 2000 to 2014. After retiring from Microsoft, Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers for $2 billion. Presently, Forbes values the team at $5.5 billion. In December, Ballmer's fortune decreased by approximately $500 million. Net worth: $117.2 billion Jensen Huang, the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, has seen his fortune soar as the company‚Äôs chips gained popularity within the AI sector. Thanks to the AI boom, Jensen Huang, the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, saw a noticeable rise in his fortune. Despite a slight dip in Nvidia shares in December, Huang secured his spot in the top 10 richest.

Title: Why Performance Chasing Is an Investing Error
URL: https://www.acepnow.com/article/why-performance-chasing-is-an-investing-error/?singlepage=1
Time Published: 2025-01-04T07:30:00Z
Full Content:
I‚Äôm now eligible for my 401(k), and I need to pick which mutual funds to invest my contributions into. I‚Äôm not sure exactly how to do this, but I can see which ones had the best returns over the last one, three, and five years, so I just thought I‚Äôd put all my money into the top two or three of them so I‚Äôm diversified. Is that the right approach? ‚ÄúPerformance chasing‚Äù is widely recognized by behavioral economists as a serious investing error. In fact, it‚Äôs such a bad idea that mutual funds are required by law to include a statement in their paperwork saying something to the effect that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I wish the statement were even stronger, saying something like, ‚ÄúOutsized past performance is highly likely to reverse in the near future.‚Äù But, alas, investing is a caveat emptor activity. Performance chasing is easy to do. It is often driven by FOMO‚Äîfear of missing out. We hear about our friends making money in ARK funds, meme stocks, Beanie Babies, or Bitcoin and pile in, only to suffer through the inevitable downturn inherent in popular investment booms. At that point, fear of loss usually kicks in and we sell low. ‚ÄúBuy high and sell low‚Äù is not a recipe for investment success. The truth is that the outperformance of a few mutual funds in your 401(k) is far more likely due to what they invest in than the skill of their managers. For example, over the last five to 10 years, U.S. stocks have generally outperformed international stocks, bonds, and real estate, especially the large cap ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and ‚Äútech‚Äù stocks, like NVIDIA, Meta (Facebook), Amazon, and Alphabet (Google). So any mutual fund that was invested heavily in those stocks will demonstrate excellent results over the last few years, no matter what their investment strategy. Chances are, the top two or three funds in your 401(k) are all invested in those same types of stocks, and buying three funds that all invest in the same stocks is just false diversification. The data are very clear that the outperformance of active mutual fund managers does not persist. Well, it may, but only among the worst ones. Some studies show that the top quintile of managers for a given year are no more likely to be in the top quintile the next year than any other manager, but the bottom quintile managers are actually more likely to be in the bottom quintile the next year. Sometimes their funds simply close and disappear from the historical record. A more recent study by the mutual fund gurus at Morningstar concluded: Over the long term, there is no meaningful relationship between past and future fund performance. In most cases, the odds of picking a future long-term winner from the best-performing quintile in each category aren‚Äôt materially different than selecting from the bottom quintile. The results strongly indicate that long-term investors should not select funds based on past performance alone. As a rule, the more you pay for an investment, the worse its future returns will be. If you can buy a rental property with a net income of $20,000 for $200,000, that will probably be a great investment. Not so much if you pay $600,000 for that same property. That‚Äôs exactly what is happening when you buy any other investment after a recent run-up in price. You‚Äôre paying more for every dollar of earnings it generates, and thus your return must be lower than that of an investor who bought it at a lower price. Any student of the markets will quickly see that there is a pendulum effect as different types of investments come in and out of favor. Sometimes growth stocks do well. Sometimes value stocks do well. Sometimes small stocks or Chinese stocks or utility stocks do well. Sometimes bonds or real estate perform well. Predicting which will do best in the near future is extraordinarily difficult. In my opinion, it‚Äôs so difficult that it is probably not worth trying to do so. Certainly, there is no evidence that just buying whatever did best in the last year, three years, or even five years is going to lead to investment success. But doing the opposite isn‚Äôt any more successful; you can‚Äôt just take a contrarian approach and buy whatever did most poorly last year, either. Sometimes stocks have gone down in value for a reason‚Äîbecause the company is en route to bankruptcy. Perhaps if it recovers, you will make out like a bandit by buying low. The company behind the stock often does not rebound; good or bad performance may persist longer than expected. So what should an investor do if they can‚Äôt just pick the best performing funds out of their 401(k)? How about creating a reasonable, written investment plan instead? Determine a priori how much of the portfolio will be invested into U.S. stocks, international stocks, bonds, real estate, and other investments. Then look ‚Äúunder the hood‚Äù at what the available funds in your 401(k) actually invest in and choose them based on the underlying investments. Among funds that invest in similar investments, the best predictor of future performance is low costs, so choose the one with the lowest expenses. These will usually be index funds. If you need help doing so, consider hiring a fiduciary, fee-only financial planner who provides good advice at a fair price. While this stuff is not that hard to learn, the consequences of doing it poorly (or not doing it at all) compound over time. It may be well worth paying a few thousand dollars to get started on the right foot. Alternatively, come to the ACEP-sponsored workshop the Saturday prior to ACEP24 in Las Vegas, and I‚Äôll help you walk through the process of writing your own financial plan. Whatever you do, don‚Äôt just buy the hottest performing stock, mutual fund, or other investment available‚Äîthat approach does not necessarily lead to long-term investing success.

If you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement. As promised, I‚Äôve got a special mailbag issue this week. Thanks to everyone who sent in questions. Like last year, I picked a handful that hit some of the themes I plan to continue covering in 2025. On to your questions‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm really concerned / worried / curious about the near-term future. Between now and 10 years from now, I think it is very clear AI will be replacing many job functions. What are we all going to do? The leaders at the AI labs say that, yes, there will be job loss, but that doesn‚Äôt mean catastrophe. The optimistic take is that humans are creative and will invent new jobs, like they always have when technology changes things. At the moment, there‚Äôs also a macro belief among the CEOs driving a lot of the spending on infrastructure for AI that its impact will be deflationary and lead to GDP growth. Job displacement will still be painful, of course. Sam Altman and others believe that some form of universal basic income will be necessary to offset the economic impacts of AGI. Altman has his other startup, Tools for Humanity, already scanning eyeballs and distributing cryptocurrency. But I think it‚Äôs way too early to be seriously concerned. As Altman himself recently said, AGI is going to be declared soon and we probably won‚Äôt notice. How much better is the reasoning on AI models, and is it actually something I should care about? I know people who have tried ChatGPT‚Äôs o1 pro mode and notice a difference. But I haven‚Äôt seen anything mind-blowing from o1 or what Noam Shazeer at Google just put out, though perhaps I am a bit jaded by the last two years of AI hype. My advice would be to play with what you can access / afford and see for yourself. The expense of running these cutting-edge ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù models is currently keeping them at bay for a lot of people. I expect access to widen significantly in 2025. Knowing how to prompt these different kinds of models effectively remains a struggle, and I‚Äôd like to see more interface improvements in apps like ChatGPT to help teach people why they should use a reasoning model. An even better move would be to abstract away all these definitions and focus on what tools can do for people. What kind of outlook do you see for Snap in 2025 and beyond? Snap‚Äôs biggest problem going into 2025 is the same problem it had going into 2024: its business isn‚Äôt growing fast enough. The app itself is bigger than ever and growing quickly, but yearly revenue growth last quarter was less than Meta‚Äôs. That‚Äôs not a compelling pitch to Wall Street when you are already viewed as the underdog. Even with ads being placed in the Chat tab and the new Spotlight redesign slowly rolling out, the jury is out on if the business can rebound to the pace it needs to this year. A depressed stock price makes it harder to recruit and retain talent, which has become more of a problem for Snap in the last couple of years. I do think the vibe could shift quickly if TikTok does end up being banned in the US or severely hamstrung by a new ownership structure. I continue to be skeptical of Evan Spiegel‚Äôs commitment to hardware with Spectacles. As I‚Äôve written before, his foresight and ambition to build AR glasses is admirable. But Snap looks increasingly outgunned in hardware. What do you expect from Meta‚Äôs glasses in 2025? There have been a couple of reports recently saying that Meta is planning to ship a pair of smart glasses with a heads-up display this year. I first reported this was going to happen in February 2023. Hypernova, as the product is internally referred to at Meta, will have a viewfinder for interacting with things like Meta AI and notifications. In my write-up of the Orion prototype, I spent a lot of time on the neural wristband because it‚Äôs going to ship with Hypernova as a way to control them (while Orion‚Äôs commercial successor is still a couple years out at least). I expect this band to be the part of the glasses that surprises people the most. Using it for the first time feels like magic. As I reported in 2023, Meta is also planning a separate smartwatch as an optional upgrade with the neural capability and more features for health tracking, etc. It‚Äôs going to be a very interesting year for Meta on the hardware front. Is TikTok going to actually be banned? No one I‚Äôve spoken with who is in a position to know thinks that China will let TikTok be fully divested from ByteDance. The algorithm definitely won‚Äôt be sold, but as I‚Äôve explained before, that isn‚Äôt as important a factor as it was the last time TikTok was facing a ban. At the same time, there is too much money and power at stake for TikTok to just disappear. President-elect Donald Trump wants to make a deal. The most likely outcome is a different version of the frankensteinian ‚ÄúTikTok Global‚Äù joint venture proposal that ByteDance agreed to back in 2020. I could see Oracle staying involved this second time given Larry Ellison‚Äôs ongoing influence at Mar-a-Lago. ByteDance will most likely continue running TikTok day-to-day while divesting some of its ownership stake. The real wild card in all this, however, is Elon Musk, who has had serious TikTok envy since he bought X‚Ä¶ Are you more bullish or bearish on Google than you were a year ago? Honestly, bullish. It‚Äôs going to be difficult to achieve Sundar Pichai‚Äôs 2025 mandate of making Gemini a serious rival to ChatGPT on the consumer side, but Google has a fountain of money, the technical talent, and unrivaled distribution. The company‚Äôs challenge is more of a cultural one. The more you have, the more you have to protect. It‚Äôs hard to get such a large, sprawling conglomerate to move fast and not care about the risk of backlash. Pichai seems well aware of this and the threats he faces, though. Even if Google has to end its Search default payments to Apple (which I predict will be the most likely outcome of the DOJ antitrust case), doing so probably hurt Apple‚Äôs bottom line more than Google‚Äôs, as Eddy Cue himself argued last week. Then there‚Äôs Waymo, which may end up paying for all of Google‚Äôs ‚Äúother bets‚Äù failures over the years ‚Äî and then some. What is a good book you recommend that falls in line with the things you report on? A curse of already reading so much for my job is that I rarely want to spend time on a book. The last book I read in full was The Biggest Bluff by Maria Konnikova, which has nothing to do with tech but is super valuable if you are getting into poker. I enjoyed how her story of becoming a pro player is woven into explaining the technicalities of the game. Three work-related books I have in my Amazon wish list I‚Äôm hoping to get to this year: Chip War, The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium, and The Wolves of K Street. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, shaking off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Friday was the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But hopes dimmed after the benchmark fell again on Thursday to notch a five-session losing streak, the longest since April. The S&P 500 and Dow both ended the holiday-shortened week with losses of over 1%, while the Nasdaq is facing a weekly drop of 2%. But tech stocks led Friday's rebound, as Tesla shares rose 8% after the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6% on Thursday. Meanwhile, Nvidia shares were up more than 4% after another sizable gain on Thursday. US Steel (X) stock slid 5% after President Joe Biden blocked Japanese buyer Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion takeover of the company, which had become a lightning rod for political opposition. On the data docket, the slump in US manufacturing lessened in December, according to new a fresh reading from the the Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) Purchasing Managers Index. The figure of 49.3% is 0.9% higher than November's data, but still failed to clear the 50-point threshold, which indicated a contraction. The reading is another data glimpse into the health of US economy and will help influence the Federal Reserve's next decision on whether to cut interest rates. US stocks shook off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) and Nvidia (NVDA) led a tech-heavy comeback, rising 8% and 4%, respectively. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.8%. Even with the win on Friday, the much-hoped-for "Santa Claus" rally failed to materialize. All three major indexes finished the holiday-shortened week with losses as the S&P and the Dow shed more than 1% for the week, while the Nasdaq gave up 2%. Mike Johnson was able to keep his spot atop the US House on Friday while seeming to offer minimal binding concessions to hard-right Republicans who had threatened his path to reelection, reports Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul What Johnson did offer ‚Äî in an announcement made just before the vote ‚Äî was a promise to "make meaningful spending reforms to eliminate trillions in waste, fraud, and abuse, and end the weaponization of government." It is a new effort that Johnson says will also include the formation of a new working group of independent experts set to work directly with Elon Musk‚Äôs extra-governmental "Department of Government Efficiency" (DOGE). It‚Äôs unclear what powers this new working group will have beyond publicizing its findings but the promise clearly helped put Johnson over the top as the opposition to him dwindled Friday afternoon. Read about the realignment of power in Washington here. Tesla shares rose more than 7% Friday as the EV maker said its sales in China climbed to a record high in 2024. The surge followed a rough day on Thursday when Tesla's first yearly decline in global sales dragged the stock down 6%. Part of the drama in Tesla's high-flying stock price is the tension between the company's perception as a carmaker and its ambitions of becoming an AI-driven robotaxi service. Meanwhile, legacy automakers GM and Ford reported strong fourth quarter earnings results Friday. Ford said US sales in Q4 rose 8.8% versus a year ago, powered by F-Series sales that jumped 21.1% in the quarter. Read more on Ford's results here. GM reported Q4 sales jumped 21% from a year ago and were up 4% in 2024 to 2.7 million vehicles, with full-size pickup sales hitting their highest level since 2007. Read more about GM's earnings here. Rivian (RIVN) stock jumped as much as 24% Friday as the EV maker reported better-than-expected vehicle sales for its quarter ending Dec. 31. Rivian said Friday that it delivered nearly 14,200 EVs during the fourth quarter, bringing its yearly sales volume to roughly 51,580 electric trucks ‚Äî within the company's prior guidance. Wall Street analysts had expected the company to deliver closer to 13,400 EVs for the period, and 51,000 for the year. Even with Friday's upswing, shares are down roughly 25% from last year. Rivian has faced a number of obstacles that have sent the stock tumbling from its all-time high above $100 following the company's high-profile market debut in 2021. Read about Rivian's bounce and its rough 2024 here. Nvidia stock (NVDA) led gains among the ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù stocks to start the new year after a group-wide sell-off in the last days of 2024, reports Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 4% Friday after gaining roughly 3% the prior day. That upswing followed a 4% dip between Christmas Eve and New Year‚Äôs Eve as megacap tech stocks dropped across the board. Tesla (TSLA) stock plunged nearly 13% over that time frame, while Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) dropped more than 4%. Meanwhile, Meta (META) and Google (GOOG) fell just under 4%. Apple (AAPL) dropped 3%. Even with its December decline, Nvidia shares ended 2024 up more than 150%. Analysts have remained bullish on the stock, estimating shares will rise to roughly $173 over the next year from their current level of $138, according to Yahoo Finance data. Read more about Nvidia's stock performance here. Nuclear energy stocks surged on Friday following the news that Constellation Energy (CEG) signed a pair of deals for a record $1 billion to deliver nuclear power to more than a dozen federal agencies in an agreement with the US General Services Administration. Shares of Constellation surged 4% Friday, alongside other nuclear companies. Oklo (OKLO) rose 21%; NuScale Power (SMR) rose 15%; and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE) gained 12%. The Constellation deal is the biggest energy purchase in the history of the GSA, which is responsible for building and managing federal buildings. It also marks a step toward the government leaning into energy agreements that derive electricity from low-carbon sources, with nuclear seen as part of the transition to renewable energy. The broader market interest in nuclear power also comes as tech giants expand their power-intensive AI operations. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as Tesla (TSLA) shares looked for a comeback and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was poised to snap a five-day losing streak. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the gains with an increase of 1.3%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. But all three indexes were set to post losses for the week. Carvana (CVNA) shares dropped again on Friday following a short seller report claiming the online car marketplace's turnaround is a "mirage." The stock fell more than 6% by 11:45 a.m ET Friday after losing nearly 2% in the prior session. On Thursday Hindenburg Research announced a short position on the stock in a report called "A Father-Son Accounting Grift for the Ages." The short seller alleged accounting fraud and suspicious stock sales by former CEO Ernie Garcia II. Garcia's son, Ernest Garcia III, is Carvana's current CEO. In a statement a company spokesperson said the arguments in the report were "intentionally misleading and inaccurate and have already been made numerous times by other short sellers seeking to benefit from a decline in our stock price." The Tempe, Ariz.-based car retailer underwent massive debt restructuring and cost cutting measures after its stock was crushed in late 2022 as Wall Street worried about a potential bankruptcy. The stock has attracted an abundance of short interest in recent years. Shares gained nearly 300% in 2024. The blocked $14.9 billion sale of US Steel (X) to Japan‚Äôs Nippon Steel begs the question of what comes next for the iconic Pittsburg-based steelmaker. On Friday, shares of US Steel fell more than 6% after President Biden announced his decision to to block foreign ownership of the American company. Union leaders, politicians and competitor Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF) an original bidder for US Steel, have all weighed in on the merger since it was announced in 2023. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a highly politicized decision the entire way through‚Äù Josh Spoores, steel analyst at CRU Group, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. The analyst notes its unlikely Cleveland-Cliffs which has hinted it‚Äôs still interested in acquiring its competitor, would end up with the purchase. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs possible but I don‚Äôt know that US Steel would be interested or that they have to do that. They‚Äôre in a much better position today than they were a few years ago and I think US Steel is perfectly situated to run their assets as their own operator today,‚Äù said Spoores. However the analyst notes industry capacity will likely be reduced amid a backdrop of lagging steel prices. ‚ÄúNippon had said they would invest and wouldn‚Äôt take anything [capacity] down. But now we‚Äôre at the point where prices are down, profits are down, it‚Äôs likely that US Steel takes down a facility,‚Äù said the analyst. Hopes that the start of the year will salvage a "Santa Claus" rally are dwindling. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off the upswing, in which the stock market historically has recorded gains from the last five sessions of December through the first two trading days of January. The rally is watched as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has generated an average return of 1.3% during the Santa Claus Rally period, with positive returns occurring 79% of the time, according to Adam Turnquist, chief technical Strategist for LPL Financial. But the benchmark index is on track to lose 2% for the week. "We believe near-term downside risk remains elevated given the recent deterioration in market breadth and momentum, stretched bullish sentiment, and macro headwinds from higher rates and a stronger dollar," said Turnquist. US stocks stepped higher on Friday, looking to shake off a downbeat start to 2025 as markets waited for manufacturing data and Tesla (TSLA) shares struggled for a comeback. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was also up roughly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%. Friday is the last day for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to pull off a "Santa Claus" rally, watched closely as a historical harbinger of solid returns for January and the year. Earnings: None of note. Economic news: ISM manufacturing, ISM prices paid (December) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed: Eyes on JPMorgan (JPM) this morning after Wolfe Research upgrades the stock. What analyst Steven Chubak is saying about his upgrade: "While JPM is not a 2025 top pick, we believe shares should outperform universal broker/trust peers. When we downgraded shares alongside our second quarter 2024 preview, we believed deeper rate cuts were poised to weigh on net interest income (given JPM‚Äôs heavier short-end gearing). Since that time, rate expectations have been revised higher and we now see upside to 2026 consensus net interest income, supporting a more robust EPS growth algorithm through 2026. While absolute valuation (P/E and price to tangible book value) is still a bit frothy vs. money center peers, on our 2026 EPS we estimate that JPM trades at ~12.5x (modest premium to peers) ‚Äî given the firm has consistently generated the strongest EPS growth among our bank coverage (supported by capital markets/deposit share gains), we believe a premium valuation is warranted, prompting our upgrade to out-perform." JPM shares are up about 1% in premarket trading. Sign in to access your portfolio

Canaccord Genuity has lifted its Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock price target to $404 from $298, maintaining a Buy rating despite weaker-than-expected deliveries in the fourth quarter. The move comes as the financial services firm remains confident about the carmaker‚Äôs long-term growth potential and the upcoming product launches. According to Canaccord‚Äôs Thursday note, the new target price is based on 40x Canaccord‚Äôs 2027E non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimate of $10.11, compared to a previous multiple of ~34x on 2026E EPS. ‚ÄúWe feel this multiple is justified based on the multiples and growth rates of Tesla‚Äôs comp set ‚Äî which we deem to be a group of megacap tech stocks, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA),‚Äù analyst George Gianarikas said in the note. ‚ÄúThis set of companies trades at a median of ~23x 2027E EPS but has a combined revenue growth rate ~half of Tesla‚Äôs from 2025-2027,‚Äù he added. Tesla‚Äôs latest delivery results were below expectations. The company reported 4Q24 deliveries of around 495,600, representing 7.1% sequential growth but falling short of Canaccord‚Äôs estimate of ~533,000 and the consensus estimate of ~498,000. Tesla‚Äôs production in the same quarter declined by 2.2% sequentially to ~459,500 units. Canaccord‚Äôs decision to maintain its bullish stance centers on new product introductions slated for 2025. Tesla has guided for new vehicles and anticipates 20-30% year-over-year unit volume growth. ‚ÄúTesla tends to deliver excitement when it refreshes its portfolio,‚Äù the note stated. This growth potential, combined with signs of bottoming auto gross margins, supports Canaccord‚Äôs positive outlook. Tesla reduced the cost of goods sold per vehicle to $35,100 in 3Q24, the lowest in the company‚Äôs history. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see how new products impact the mix ‚Äî but we do forecast improving margins in 2025,‚Äù Gianarikas said. Canaccord also highlighted advances in Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. While the firm remains cautious about timelines for robotaxi deployments, recent updates to FSD have been described as ‚Äúunbelievable, incredible‚Äù by users, signaling potential for higher adoption rates. ‚ÄúAn increase in FSD adoption could positively impact Tesla's profit margins and bolster confidence in the company's ability to monetize its substantial investment in artificial intelligence infrastructure,‚Äù the analyst continued. Moreover, Tesla‚Äôs energy storage segment remains a bright spot. Deployments surged to about 11.0 GWh in 4Q24, up 59.4% sequentially and 243.5% year-over-year. The construction of Tesla‚Äôs Shanghai Megafactory was completed in late 2024, and production is expected to ramp up in 1Q25. Lastly, Canaccord points to the potential in the robotics sector for Tesla, emphasizing it sees 2025 ‚Äúas the year of the robot.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe see increasing support for Tesla‚Äôs earnings multiple based on its leadership in this burgeoning sector.‚Äù

Title: Incorporating earned value management into income statements to improve project management profitability and elevate application in the business and management

Our goal is to improve Project Management (PM) profitability and reduce discrepancies in information among stakeholders, which can result in conflicts. This will be accomplished by incorporating Earned Value Management (EVM) with the Income Statement and incorporating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) with the work breakdown structure (WBS). These incorporations will streamline information sharing between PM, other management professionals, and the stakeholders, ultimately fostering the application of PM within broader business and management contexts. We drew on theories from Project, Operations, Financial Management, Agency Theory, and the Theory of Performance Frontiers. We conducted multiple case studies in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. Our analysis involved both qualitative and quantitative methods, ensuring the accuracy and practicality of our hypotheses and instilling confidence in our research findings. This integration addresses the information gap on profitability for non-project management professionals, empowering stakeholders to enhance project performance. This integration benefits the company by allowing the project manager and stakeholders to gain real-time insights into the project‚Äôs profitability, which enables continuous optimization of daily EBITDA by improving efficiency and productivity to achieve the project‚Äôs profitability target. This study and its innovative findings originate from the author‚Äôs unique approach, which is a significant contribution to the field of Project Management. This research focused on project management using EVM in for-profit organizations. Integrating EVM in the income statement also facilitates PM application in other management systems.

Project management is a well-established field that deals with complex tasks within tight constraints [1, 2]. It is integral to modern management with strong theoretical foundations and scientific rigor [3‚Äì5]. Despite its importance, project management research receives little attention in leading business and management journals. The project management manifesto encourages collaboration between social scientists and urges business and management experts to make project research more relevant to society [3]. The use of EVM in project management has grown but is not widely accepted in business due to its limitations in addressing quality, uncertainty, and profitability [2, 3]. Current EVM indicators are limited and need enhancement. Profitability measurements are missing, creating a lack of real-time awareness among project managers and potential conflicts with stakeholders [4]. Upon analysis, it‚Äôs clear that EVM lacks profitability indicators. This hampers managers‚Äô real-time understanding of project profitability, leading to reliance on financial reports later. This knowledge gap among managers can create conflicts. Our research suggests integrating EBITDA into EVM to maximize daily EBITDA in all processes, WBS, and work packages for improved performance and profitability. Our study utilized multiple embedded case studies within complex defense industries in a shipbuilding corporation with 25 projects and an aircraft manufacturing corporation with 20 projects. We collected and analyzed qualitative data through NVivo interviews and quantitative data through SPSS surveys. Data collection took place over a longitudinal time horizon. We aim to improve EVM by integrating it into the income statement and linking EBITDA to WBS and work packages to provide timely profitability information, enhance daily performance, and broaden the practical application of project management. This research has implications for real-world implementation in business and management. This study focuses on both profit-driven and not-for-profit organizations, as both need to secure operational earnings for sustainable success. However, the study does not delve into the measurement of interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization in project management, nor does it explore the role of project management in valuations such as mergers and acquisitions. The novelty of this research lies in integrating EVM into the income statement and EBITDA into the WBS, enhancing project management profitability and applying EVM‚ÄìPM in other business and management fields, which is the author‚Äôs innovation. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 1, Introduction, and Section 2. Literature Review and Section 3 Research Methods. Then we will have Section 4, Result and Discussion, and finally, Section 5 is the conclusion. The upcoming section will provide a comprehensive review of how to enhance Project Management (PM) profitability and elevate PM applications in other business and management fields. Firstly, we will explore project-based firms (PBF), projects, and Earned Value Management (EVM), including components such as Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Packages. We will also delve into Agency Theory, which covers the roles of principals (Project Owners) and agents (Contractors) and how information gaps about profitability can lead to conflicts among stakeholders. Additionally, we will discuss the disparity between PM language and financial literacy, such as Earnings Before Interests, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) among stakeholders, and its impact on information asymmetry using the theory of Productivity Frontiers. To address Research Question 1, we need to answer research questions 2, 3, 4, and 5 to understand the practical application of EVM in business management. Therefore, we will delve into topics such as Project Based Firm (PBF), Agency Theory, and Information Asymmetry in Section 2.1. Fig 1 visually presents the five steps to incorporate Project Management EVM with the Income Statement. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g001 In section 2.2, our focus is on the integration of EVM into the Income Statement, a crucial step to improve Project Management profitability. In Section 2.3, we will explore the appropriateness of EBITDA as the Primary Profitability indicator of PM. Section 2.4 will discuss how to integrate EVM‚ÄìIncome Statement and EBITDA to enhance profitability, and Section 2.5 will delve into how to maximize PM daily EBITDA. Furthermore, section 2.6 will discuss the benefit of using EBITDA in the EVM-PM. Section 2.7 will discuss enhancing EVM-Income Statement‚ÄîEBITDA in the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to support PM. Additionally, we will organize the literature from section 2.1 until section 2.5 and define the boundary of the study that focuses on PM from the agents (contractors‚Äô) perspectives and exclude the discussion of project owner benefits that may result from the project usage after PM completion. We also exclude discussing managing interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization for corporation valuations. Finally, in section 2.8, we will summarize how to elevate PM applications by integrating EVM with income statements and WBS‚ÄîEBITDA into other business and management fields and summarize the hypothesis we built during the literature review. Project management is a complex field that aims to deliver cost-effective, high-quality, timely, and safe products [4, 6‚Äì10]. Frontier analysis identifies best-in-class companies and areas for improvement, driving continuous improvement and providing a competitive advantage [11]. We will explore how to enhance the use of EVM beyond project management and traditional methods [4], to prioritize project management efficiency, productivity, and profitability from the outset. Project management is crucial for project-based firms (PBFs) to enhance employee performance and execute projects effectively [2]. It extends to encompass internal and external stakeholders with diverse expectations [3]. Agency theory provides insights into inter-organizational relationships, highlighting the importance of aligning the principal‚Äôs and agent‚Äôs value propositions to achieve optimal project management outcomes [12]. Prioritizing diverse stakeholders and promoting transparent communication are essential. Information asymmetry arises when one party possesses information they do not openly share. However, such information asymmetry can give rise to opportunistic behavior [13, 14], typically exhibited by the agent [15] and sometimes by the principal [16]. RQ1. How can a company integrate EVM into Income Statement to improve Project Management Profitability and elevate application in the Business and Management? To answer Research Question 1 (RQ1), we split it into three RQ as follows: Further we will study the literature to answer RQ1. 1 by studying seven layers of Income Statements (I/S) framework. The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, is a vital financial reporting tool for businesses and management, providing crucial insights into costs, benefits, and operational profitability [17‚Äì21]. The seven-step income statement structure, depicted in Fig 1, serves as a valuable framework. The process starts with revenue, direct operating costs, and gross profit, a key measure of operational profitability. However, it is important to note that gross profit does not account for indirect operating costs [22], and should not be the sole measure of operating profitability. On the other hand, EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Taxes) includes all operating costs, including depreciation and amortization. Although depreciation and amortization are considered operating costs, they are not directly controlled by project managers but rather by the board of directors (BOD) [23, 24]. Thus, we do not recommend using EBIT as a profitability objective for daily project management activities, as daily depreciation and amortization are fixed costs not within the control of project managers. EBITDA includes direct and indirect operating costs but excludes interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization. Company EBITDA is solely under company operational control, and PM EBITDA is under project managers‚Äô control. EBITDA can be used to measure operational efficiency, productivity, and profitability [24, 25], making it a valuable key performance indicator (KPI) for project management. Our next step will be to delve into its suitability as a KPI in PM and investigate how to integrate EVM with the income statement framework. It is essential to recognize the significance of PM profitability for its success, growth, and continual operation [26]. Thus, it is crucial to grasp the terminology of profitability measures in Earned Value Management (EVM) and align them with the profit and loss framework, as depicted in Fig 2. EVM is a comprehensive system that compares actual and budgeted work values, time, and costs. Through the integration of time and cost perspectives, EVM assesses schedule and cost performance, calculates variances, and forecasts total cost and duration [2, 7, 27‚Äì33]. (Author‚Äôs property). (Author‚Äôs property). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g002 Fig 2 illustrates several EVM indicators, including Planned Value (PV) as the "budgeted cost of work scheduled" (BCWS), Earned Value (EV) as the "budgeted cost of work performed" (BCWP), and Actual Costs (AC) as the "actual costs of work performed" (ACWP) [27, 29‚Äì32, 34, 35]. The Earned Value Management (EVM) method lacks profitability indicators, leading to information imbalances among stakeholders. Integrating profitability indicators into EVM will enhance transparency and support from stakeholders [18]. Additionally, the EVM method does not consider revenue, using the term "budget" instead, necessitating the inclusion of a baseline for production and profitability [26]. The interpretation of Planned Value (PV) varies based on perspective. For effective management of profit-driven organizations, it is crucial for a contractor‚Äôs planned cost to differ from the planned revenue received from the owner. Setting a zero-profitability target may not motivate project managers to prioritize profit, and an unclear buffer between revenue and cost may lead to cost overruns. Project managers (PMs) can utilize EBITDA as a buffer between revenues and costs to address this issue. This buffer can be represented by the equation: Planned cost = planned revenue minus planned EBITDA. By integrating the EBITDA target as a profitability goal, the project manager can effectively manage profitability and intervene early if necessary [33, 36]. Moreover, incorporating buffer into the EVM system can positively impact profitability [37]. In Fig 2, we illustrate the integration of EVM into the Income Statement and the incorporation of EBITDA into the framework. Incorporating EBITDA into EVM can streamline accounting processes and enable direct project performance management. However, it‚Äôs important to evaluate the relevance of using EBITDA as a KPI in project management before implementation [38, 39]. Within this framework, our objective was to verify the suitability of EBITDA as a KPI in PM. In addressing the second research question, we explore the significance of profitability for project management activities and introduce some terminology related to operational profitability. Fig 3 vividly illustrates the seven crucial steps of an Income Statement. It begins with sales activity, effectively generating revenue. The next step involves the Company‚Äôs core operations, which consume direct operational costs, encompassing both variable and fixed costs, culminating in the creation of gross profit. The third step involves the Company Supporting Units engaging in Indirect Operations activities, such as General Administration, and consuming Indirect Operating Costs resulting in EBITDA (Earnings Before interest, depreciation, and amortization). Finally, the decision to expense Depreciation and Amortization by the Board of Directors leads to EBIT (Earnings Before Interests and Tax), also called Operating Profit [25, 40]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g003 Noticeably, the Company‚Äôs operations management authority is confined to specific operational expenses, as control over Depreciation and Amortization expenses rests with the Board of Directors. The decision to account for Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax falls within the Board of Directors‚Äô purview, limiting the Operations Management‚Äôs jurisdiction to EBITDA. Consequently, operations management has no complete control over operating profit expenses because it excludes depreciation from its jurisdiction. The ultimate earnings that operations management can deliver is EBITDA [25, 40]. The frontier approach assesses performance using managerial benchmarks and theoretical perspectives. The production frontier represents the highest level of performance achievable by an operational unit based on its operational decisions (Vastag, 2000). EBITDA can be a critical operational management performance indicator (KPI), representing the profitability frontier under their direct control. In addition, Fig 3 illustrates the correlations between earnings metrics, such as Earning Before Tax (EBT), Earnings After Tax (EAT) or Net Profit, and Retained Earnings, and management authority and control. This illustration highlights the essential role of operational management in achieving profitability and control [25, 40]. Critics of EBITDA as a company indicator argue that it is an inadequate measure for evaluating investment activities since it requires consideration of other indicators and is not a reliable proxy for net cash flow [41]. Additionally, some argue that EBITDA is insufficient for guiding financial strategies and valuation decisions such as bankruptcy, mergers, and acquisitions [42‚Äì45]. On the other hand, advocates of EBITDA as an indicator maintain that it is a suitable measure of a company‚Äôs operations and project management profitability, reflecting the ultimate profitability that only operations management and project management can achieve [41, 46‚Äì50]. A Key Performance Indicator (KPI) is a crucial metric used to gauge the achievement of critical objectives and is essential for understanding and enhancing performance [51]. EBITDA is a performance metric that assesses a company‚Äôs profitability by excluding factors such as taxes, interest, and debt costs [23, 52]. It is a reliable indicator of operational effectiveness and is well-suited as a profitability metric for evaluating operational management [53]. It‚Äôs important to align performance dimensions with company practices such as knowledge management, openness, and sustainability [54]. Performance measurement involves assessing effectiveness and efficiency using specific measures [55]. EBITDA is crucial for operational management and integrating it into earned value management (EVM) can help project managers plan and control financial targets. An effective performance management system should incorporate a limited number of KPIs to provide a comprehensive view of company performance and prevent information overload [55]. Integrating EBITDA into EVM allows project managers to plan and control financial targets effectively. Based on this review, we establish the following hypotheses: In this section, we will delve into integrating EBITDA into EVM for project management, which addresses the third research question. Our focus will be on exploring the incorporation of EBITDA measures to maximize daily EBITDA within EVM, and we will pose two important questions: 1. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS enable active profitability management? 2. Can integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and WBS streamline operations and project management while increasing profitability? To address these inquiries, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of various EVM performance indicators and devised a strategy for integrating EBITDA into the current system. EBITDA is crucial as a performance metric not only to gauge performance but also to facilitate the formulation of improvement initiatives [54]. Performance indicators play a vital role in enabling companies to evaluate their systems‚Äô adherence to standards and progress toward specific objectives [56]. Using key performance indicators such as EBITDA empowers managers to adeptly guide the company towards enhancement, make well-informed decisions, and incentivize and reward employees. With technological advancements, it is now feasible to collect data and analyze the most pertinent variables in real time to assess key performance indicators [51]. Fig 4 depicts the S-Curve EVM project management from the project owner‚Äôs viewpoint, wherein PV represents the Planned Value equivalent to the Planned Costs. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g004 The Budget Actual Costs (BAC) represent the accumulated planned expenses for a project. The Earned Value (EV) is subtracted from the Actual Costs (AC) to calculate the cost variance. Meanwhile, the Schedule Variance (SV) compares the Earned Value (EV) and Planned Value (PV) against the project baseline and work schedule. It‚Äôs worth noting that EVM relies on monetary values instead of schedule indicators, which some professionals may find unreliable [32, 57]. This study focuses on examining the financial metrics utilized to manage project management profitability. However, the current version of the Earned Value Management (EVM) framework lacks complete oversight over production and revenue. Therefore, it is necessary to establish an additional baseline to ensure better control over these aspects [26]. EBITDA and EVM can be integrated into project management for a positive outcome. The project manager can use EBITDA as a buffer to manage actual costs effectively. Based on Fig 5, the EBITDA figure is positive, which suggests that the revenue surpasses the costs incurred (EV-AC). In project management, cost variance is the difference between planned and actual costs, denoted as CV (PM) = planned costs‚ÄîAC. Moreover, schedule variance (SV) is the difference between the work performed and the scheduled planned value (SV = EV‚ÄîPV). We must integrate these metrics into each WBS and work package to include EBITDA and EBITDA Margin in the EVM. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.g005 Numerous companies encounter difficulties when implementing budgets [58]. The literature emphasizes that performance measurement is essential for effectively managing production systems [56]. Inaccurate data can hinder companies in assessing profitability and recognizing areas for improvement [54]. Financial indicators like EBITDA are important for demonstrating the process‚Äôs financial performance to management. Developing key performance indicators (KPIs) such as EBITDA would enable stakeholders to have visibility into the process‚Äôs real-time performance [59]. Monitoring real-time product costs is crucial for promptly identifying any unexpected increases that could erode the EBITDA margin [51]. The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) serves as a framework for outlining the project budget [30, 60, 61]. EBITDA can be assigned to each WBS and Work Package using a top-down approach, establishing target EBITDA and refining these allocations based on bottom-up input. By combining bottom-up and top-down approaches, governance challenges can be addressed effectively, and learning within the project management process can be promoted. The allocation of EBITDA to every WBS provides a profitability indicator for each business process. Companies can apply Business Process Reengineering (BPR) to reduce activity costs by analyzing and redesigning WBS workflows and processes [62]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into the WBS facilitates the implementation of BPR in project management, ultimately strengthening profitability. In addition to the result of the study in section 2.4 we will further study to addresses the third research question RQ3. How can a company use integrated EVM-I/S to increase PM profitability and maximize PM daily EBITDA? To maximize daily EBITDA, project managers need to focus on improving cost efficiency, productivity, quality, delivery, and safety [13, 63, 64]. The first step is to provide structured indicators to assess whether a production system efficiently uses its resources [56]. Maximizing daily EBITDA involves conducting daily simulations [65], setting high expectations, utilizing objective data, and providing timely feedback on performance [66]. Strategies like Business Process (BP) methods [11], and the Project Value Risk Opportunity (PVRO) framework can help achieve high-performance positions and optimize decision-making [4, 67, 68]. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint through lean methods in business process management, which involves identifying customer value and addressing wastage to resolve bottlenecks. Companies can maximize EBITDA by elevating the constraint by increasing their capacity with extra resources [69]. Addressing wastage can resolve bottlenecks in the process, leading to improvements [59]. The superficial differences in Business Processes improvement may significantly impact project success [62]. In summary, we define the following hypotheses: This section answers the fourth research question: What benefits does using EBITDA to measure PM profitability offer? Through a literature review, we identified the limitations of EVM implementation [6], and how integrating EBITDA can mitigate these issues: It is crucial to integrate EBITDA into each Work Breakdown Structure as it enables a company to establish an internal control system for guiding resource allocation decisions based on WBS EBITDA or EBITDA Margin. These internal control systems are essential for managing companies with multi-operation production systems, particularly in the context of organizations overseeing multiple manufacturing facilities. The introduction of divisional and departmental budgets plays a key role in overseeing daily operations and comparing production and costs across different divisions and departments [65]. Integrating EBITDA into WBS, the company can differentiate the critical and non-critical activities in Project management. Project managers are required to work closely with other departments to effectively manage EBITDA and meet EBITDA targets. Coordination involves integrating a series of interdependent tasks that are essential for organizational productivity and efficiency [70‚Äì72]. Cooperation is vital for the successful implementation of complex strategies, relying on coordinated efforts and information sharing [71, 73]. Therefore, integrating EBITDA into EVM will allow for better visualization of the interdependency among activities. Achieving target EBITDA requires improved cooperation, coordination, and interdependency among activities. Maximizing daily EBITDA hinges on improving behavior and engagement. Engagement refers to involvement, commitment, and the willingness to overcome obstacles or constraints in strategy execution, ultimately challenging these constraints and delivering better performance [70, 74‚Äì76]. Therefore, integration of EBITDA into WBS will simplify manager to manage profitability. Ensuring maximum daily EBITDA across all work breakdown structures and work packages requires effective communication. Precise and efficient communication is vital for sharing strategic information and facilitating successful implementation [72, 75, 77]. Thus, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will provide project managers with the necessary information. Therefore, integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures will enable the project manager‚Äôs ability to get the information needed. The above findings reveal that integrating EBITDA as a business process target and WBS enables project managers to improve daily profitability. The integration simplifies the project managers‚Äô ability to demonstrate daily profitability (to avoid information asymmetry). In addition, the integration enables support project manager in achieving successful strategy and PM Target. Based on our findings, we formulated the following hypothesis: Building on the previous findings, we are now addressing research question 5: How can a company optimize its support for strategic PM decisions using EBITDA? Evaluating project success is challenging, as different stakeholders have varying definitions of success. To address this, it‚Äôs important to consider the perspectives of the owner, contractor, end user, and the public. While measuring management performance is crucial, financial results often lag behind decision-making, posing challenges for taking timely action [55]. To prevent delays in accessing profitability information, it is recommended to monitor daily EBITDA. By sharing profitability information and displaying planned and actual daily EBITDA, the company can promote transparency and enhance its capabilities in this area. This approach fosters effective communication, supports knowledge management, and reinforces the significance of project management [17, 20, 78]. The equitable distribution of information has a positive impact on both individual and organizational performance. Effective communication by project managers significantly enhances the performance of project teams, as managers dedicate considerable time to communicating with team members and key stakeholders [79]. Sharing information can facilitate manufacturing decisions while visualizing and communicating efficiency and productivity can assist in setting goals and driving performance improvement [80]. The use of EBITDA indicator in every WBS enables PM to indicate deviations and streamline our business processes. This method helps us visualize and evaluate capacity across all processes, synchronize operational capacity, and identify bottlenecks [81, 82]. It is essential to communicate clearly and effectively when sharing information about EBITDA results, including the target, strategy, and implementation. This clear communication is crucial for ensuring that everyone understands the information and can successfully execute the strategy [70, 72, 77]. By summarizing this discussion and those in the previous subsections, we developed the following hypotheses: comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. From the above study, we can summarize that integrating EVM‚ÄîIncome Statements -WBS‚ÄîEBITDA can broaden the application of EVM in management and business fields. Further, we will provide a summary table to ease the test of the hypotheses in the next Section. To answer RQ1, we summarize the finding from previous study and hypothesis in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t001 Table 1 provides an overview of the research questions, corresponding hypotheses, planned data collection, and analysis for Batch #1 and #2. The second round of data collection and analysis will be carried out to assess the comprehension of the concept after eleven months of research in the longitudinal time frame. In reference to the study discussed in Section 2, it was concluded that incorporating earned value management (EVM) into income statements has the potential to improve project management profitability and increase its significance in the business and management fields. This research is a step towards wider acceptance of EVM in these domains. Furthermore, we will delve into the hypotheses in the upcoming section. The authors have confirmed that this study was reviewed and approved by the institutional review board (ethics committee) of the Bandung Institute of Technology prior to commencement. The original approval document was obtained from our academic institution‚Äôs ethics committee. The author and the author‚Äôs institution have obtained permission from the companies to conduct research for academic purposes and have been authorized to produce academic literature. The ethics statement document includes the written permit (approval) for research within the companies. The researcher/interviewer conducted the study without any prior relationship with the participants. Regarding participant consent, the author and the companies informed the participants that the study was purely for academic purposes. The research participants are company officials and management; no minors were included. The authors commenced research in Shipbuilding on May 15, 2023, and concluded it on July 12, 2024. Additionally, they initiated research in Aircraft Manufacturing on May 22, 2023, and completed it on July 19, 2024. To explore the connection between EVM and profitability, we conducted a comprehensive literature review using Science Direct, Google Scholar, and Publish or Perish with the keyword "Earned Value Management." Initially, our search resulted in over 1000 articles. We then refined our search by adding the keyword "profit" and setting the publication date from 2014 onwards, which narrowed the relevant articles to 108. Using NVivo, we meticulously analyzed these articles to identify word frequencies. Our analysis revealed that "project = 15.754," "earned = 3.226," "EVM = 3.390," and "costs = 1.068" were frequently mentioned, while "revenue = 66," "profit = 300," and "profitability = 53" appeared less often. Overlooking these critical aspects could lead to information imbalances and conflicts among stakeholders, underscoring the necessity of integrating profitability into EVM for effective project management [78]. The table of this findings is available in S1 Appendix. Later in this chapter, our research indicates that EBITDA is the optimal profitability frontier for project management [67] and can serve as a suitable indicator for PM. By integrating EBITDA into EVM methodology, we can maximize daily EBITDA in every business process, WBS, and work package to enhance PM performance and profitability. Our research aims to create practical solutions through a pragmatic philosophy. Our methodology combined deduction and induction, and we developed a protocol to guide our research process [83]. We collected qualitative data through interviews and observation, while quantitative data was collected through online surveys. We employed a Multiple Embedded Case Study design. The selection was imperative to examine project complexity factors from an unbiased and comprehensive perspective [84]. Our analysis involved using SPSS for statistical analysis and NVivo for qualitative analysis. The Case Study Protocol and Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research Checklist are available in S2 and S3 Appendices [83, 85]. The corresponding author conducted the interview or focus group. The author has 25 years of experience as a management consultant and is considered an expert in turnaround strategies. The participants know the interviewer as the company‚Äôs Turnaround Expert. The interviewers‚Äô genuine interest in the research topic and enthusiasm about conducting a case study that combines long-term practical experience with theory is evident. The study focused on understanding profitability information asymmetry in Project Management using EVM systems. They are eager to share knowledge with academic and practical communities. The authors of this study delved into relevant theories and conducted surveys to comprehensively explore the effects of information asymmetry on profitability in Project Management, specifically through the use of EVM systems. They found that this information imbalance could potentially lead to conflicts between management and stakeholders. To gain a deeper understanding, the study employed both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, utilizing multiple embedded case studies and surveys. The research focused on Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to improve Project Management Performance and Profitability. Specifically, the study included two project-based organizations in the defense industry. The authors conducted detailed case studies on two companies that integrated EVM with Income Statements and EBITDA into their WBS. The first company, a prominent shipbuilding company, managed 25 projects, including warships and submarines, while the second company, an aircraft manufacturing company, oversaw 20 projects, including helicopters and rockets. The study included the collection of both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative research methods, such as interviews and purposive sampling, were utilized. Invitations were extended to 30 individuals from Shipbuilding and Aircraft Manufacturing Companies, and 20 participants from various levels within the organizations were selected to take part. Regrettably, ten individuals were unable to participate due to time and scheduling constraints. Additional qualitative data was gathered through observations at aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies, as well as through meeting minutes from the corporate office. The research purpose was to communicate to the interviewees through various means, including face-to-face interviews, emails, WhatsApp messages, and phone calls. The company‚Äôs Board of Directors and employees were involved in the survey and interviews. The researcher obtained qualitative data from the corporate office through observations, interviews, and meeting minutes. During the interviews, only the interviewer and the interviewees were present. However, during observations and group discussions, non-participants who were company employees not assigned to the project were in the room. The researchers provided a question guide and survey questionnaires for the structured interviews. For the unstructured interviews, the interviewees freely expressed their opinions about the program. Repeat interviews with the same person were not conducted. Structured interviews involved asking the same standardized questions to different interviewees. Before recording, the author informed the interviewees that the interview would be recorded and obtained their consent. During the interviews, the author used audio-visual recording via Zoom to gather data, enabling the taking of meeting minutes during the session. Interviews and discussions typically lasted 30‚Äì60 minutes, and participants received transcripts for review. For Interviews, we sent thirty invitations to two companies, ten people unable to participate due to time and schedule constraints. As shown in Table 2, the author held two sessions of interviews with 20 volunteers representing various positions, including board members, senior executives, managers, project managers, and professionals from the PM team. The interview participants are as follows: one COO (Male, master‚Äôs degree); one CFO (Male, master‚Äôs degree); one EVP (Male, a master‚Äôs degree); nine V.P. (1 Male with a Doctorate, 1 Female with a master‚Äôs degree, 4 Males with a master‚Äôs degree, 3 Males with a bachelor‚Äôs degree); and eight Managers (1 Male with a master‚Äôs degree, 3 Females with bachelor‚Äôs degrees, 4 Males with bachelor‚Äôs degrees). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t002 The first session consisted of structured interviews with predetermined questions. We distributed research protocols before the questionnaires to ensure the validity and reliability of our study [83, 84]. In the second session, we conducted unstructured interviews to delve deeper into participants‚Äô understanding of integrating EBITDA with EVM and its usefulness in project management for their company. We specifically focused on the benefits of measuring PM EBITDA for project managers and stakeholders [78]. We used a longitudinal time horizon to understand the development of business processes and cultural improvement over time, which is valuable for researchers and project managers [2]. The researcher identified the themes in advance, but the author did not discuss data saturation in this qualitative research. The author used NVivo software to analyze the qualitative data from the interviews. During the project/program briefing, the participants were provided feedback on the findings. In addition, we combined the case study with the survey method to create a comprehensive mixed-methods research design [83]. The author collected data from two separate participant batches from shipbuilding and aircraft manufacturing companies for quantitative data. We conducted our survey in two batches, with 220 volunteer participants (104 Shipbuilding participants, and 116 Aircraft Manufacturing Participants) surveyed over six months to test Hypotheses. As shown in Table 3, during the second batch, we involved 125 volunteer participants (from both companies) over 11 months to test hypotheses A, B, C, and D. Our empirical data was collected using questionnaires scored on 7-point Likert scales and was quantitatively analyzed using SPSS. The researcher used the participants‚Äô quotations to explain the findings from the interview results. The participants conveyed their perspectives using standard daily language, adding depth and authenticity to the research. This use of daily language made the findings more transparent and more relatable by showcasing how they were grounded in the participants‚Äô actual words. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t003 Referring to section 2.1.3, Fig 2 shows the integration of the income statement‚Äôs structure, EVM, and its relationship with management control. Our research findings from section 2 indicate that companies can integrate EVM into overall business management by aligning it with income statement metrics. We propose expanding the use of EVM beyond project management. Project managers can incorporate EBITDA into every WBS to facilitate the direct translation of EVM indicators into financial reporting language and establish a relevant profitability metric for project management. To validate these conclusions, we comprehensively analyzed quantitative and qualitative data to address all remaining research questions. In our initial data collection, we analyzed 220 questionnaires using IBM-SPSS to examine the use of EBITDA in project management profitability. We also investigated how a company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system and the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability. This analysis used the following abbreviations: AMC means aircraft manufacturing corporation and SBC means shipbuilding corporation. Supporting Information for the First Batch of data analysis is available in S4 Appendix. Proportion Testing Hypothesis Research Question 2: Is EBITDA the proper measure for project management profitability? Hypothesis 1.A: EBITDA is the proper measure of Project Management Profitability because it excludes Interest, Tax, Depreciation, and Amortization, which do not vary due to Project Management efficiency and productivity variation. Hypothesis 1. B: EBITDA is the proper measure of project management profitability because it is entirely under the control of the project manager and team. Research Question 3: How can a company maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system? The Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA with EVM and applying target EBITDA margins in every work breakdown structure and work package. Hypothesis 2.A: The Company can maximize EBITDA with EVM in Project Management by integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying target EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. Research Question 4: What are the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability? Hypotheses 3.A: Using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows Project Managers and Teams to manage and maximize Project Management Profitability actively. Hypothesis 3.B Applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily Research Question 5 How can a company improve its ability to support and make strategic decisions for Project Management using EBITDA? Hypotheses 4.A: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA result with its supporting Units. Hypothesis 4.B: The Company can improve its ability to support Project management by sharing the daily Target and Actual EBITDA with the Board of Directors to provide timely strategic decisions to Project management Chi square Testing This analysis technique belongs to non-parametric statistics, which is a branch of statistics that does not rely on the assumption of a particular distribution of the data. It is often used when the data does not meet the assumption of normality or when the sample size is small. This method is more flexible and can be applied to ordinal data or data that is not measured at intervals. Hypothesis H01: œÄ ‚â§ 0.70 Ha1: œÄ > 0.70 The test statistics used in the population proportion test Chi square test , the proportion of people who answered 6 or 7 to the question, and po = 0.70. The decision-making rule was to reject Ho if œá2>œá2 table with Œ± = 0.05 Table 4 displays the Hypothesis Testing Results. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t004 The First Batch Hypothesis testing results are shown in Table 4. 1. While testing hypothesis 1.A, both AMC and SBC agree that EBITDA is a suitable measure of Project Management Profitability. 2. In evaluating hypothesis 1.B, there is a divergence of opinions between AMC and SBC regarding the control of EBITDA Project Management, with SBC disagreeing with the statement (œá2- value < 3.481 and p-value>0.05). 3. When testing hypothesis 2.A, there are differing opinions on whether integrating EBITDA to WBS and applying the target EBITDA Margin in WBS and Work Package can maximize EBITDA in EVM. Less than 70% of SBC respondents disagreed with the statement (œá2- value < 3.481 and p value> 0.05). 4. Hypothesis 3.A. testing indicates that using EBITDA as a measure of Project Management Profitability allows for active management and maximization of profitability, with approval from most AMC and SBC respondents (more than 70%, with œá2- value > 3.481 and -value < 0.05). 5. Hypothesis 3.B testing reveals a key insight: applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS empowers companies to display and control Project Management Profitability daily. While SBC respondents may have disagreed (œá2- value < 3.481 and p-value >0.05), the practical implications of this finding are significant, providing a clear path to enhanced profitability management. 6. In testing hypotheses 4.A and 4.B, a unanimous approval was received from all AMC and SBC respondents. This finding underscores the Company‚Äôs potential to enhance its ability to support Project management by sharing daily Targets and Actual EBITDA results with the Company‚Äôs supporting Units and the Board of Directors, instilling confidence in the proposed strategies. After implementing Maximizing Daily EBITDA in Aircraft Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Companies for eleven months, we conducted the second round of data collection. We gathered responses from 125 questionnaires without differentiating between aircraft manufacturing and shipbuilding companies. We tested several EBITDA and operational profitability hypotheses using a test statistic, œá2. The results of the testing are summarized below. Supporting Information for the Second Batch of data analysis is available in S5 Appendix. Our commitment to a comprehensive analysis led us to conduct proportion testing on the data, testing a multitude of hypotheses.

Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values calculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompasses both structured and unstructured interviews. After completing a comprehensive qualitative data analysis, it has become evident that EBITDA is the most suitable operating profit indicator for the EVM system in Project Management. Integrating EBITDA into EVM involves establishing the budget‚Äôs EBITDA value to determine plan costs and applying the EBITDA margin in every work breakdown structure and work package. By using EBITDA to evaluate project management profitability, the company can empower the project manager and team to understand the target EBITDA and maximize profitability. Sharing EBITDA can also enhance support and facilitate timely strategic decisions for Project Management. The qualitative analysis conducted with NVivo, as depicted in Table 4, showcases the findings from structured interviews. The comprehensive results obtained from NVivo encompass both structured and unstructured interviews. Discussion of qualitative analysis with NVivo Table 7 and Fig A-3 until A-6 in S1 Appendix display the results of the qualitative analysis using structured interviews by NVivo. Supporting Information of the interview is available in S6 Appendix. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.t007 Referring to the Quantitative and Qualitative data results, we found that some employees needed to be aware of the importance of EBITDA for Project Management during the early assessment. Regarding H2, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that EBITDA project management is entirely under the control of the project manager and the team. This response is because some operational and project management personnel remained unaware of the EBITDA concept. Many of them were not concerned with controlling EBITDA. The Interview with the chief financial and human capital officer (Interviewee O) confirmed this result. Regarding H3, less than 70% of SBC respondents agreed that a company can maximize EBITDA in EVM by integrating EBITDA into WBS and applying the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package. This response is because some people in the SBC did not have experience implementing the EBITDA‚ÄìEVM integration. The SBC was in the early stage of implementing EBITDA‚ÄìEVM integration using its information technology system, the ITS. The senior vice president of corporate transformation (Interviewee D) confirmed this explanation in the Interview. Regarding H5, less than 70% of the SBC respondents agreed that applying EBITDA to EVM and WBS enables companies to display and control project management profitability daily. This response is because some SBC employees need experience managing daily Profitability. However, the management expected the situation to change because the Company has begun implementing daily control and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system, supported by their information system, ITS. The vice president of human capital (Interviewee M) confirmed this explanation and explained the Company‚Äôs policy to control employees‚Äô daily activities using handphone devices provided by the Company. After eleven months of maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management, we found significant improvement in understanding the concept from the survey of both companies. Regarding the first research question, we found that the respondents agree that EBITDA is appropriate for project management profitability. Fig 2 displays the integration of EVM into the Income Statement using seven earnings steps. Fig 3 shows EBITDA under the control of Operation Management and Project Management. On the other hand, Depreciation, Amortization, Interest, and Tax are not under the control of Operation Management but of the Board of Directors. Regarding the second research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company can maximize daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS). Regarding the third Research Question, we found that the respondents agree that the Company can get the benefits of using EBITDA to measure project management profitability from Integrating EBITDA as a target in Business Processes and Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) that will ease Operational Management and Project Management to display their Profitability every day. Regarding the fourth research question, we found that respondents agree that the Company improved its ability to support and make strategic decisions for project management using EBITDA from the availability of daily EBITDA information for divisions and company operational units, as well as project management to provide support for achieving successful strategy and project management. All proportions who answered 6 and 7 were more significant than 0.70 (70%) with a relatively small standard error. Standard Error measures the precision of estimates/estimates of population parameters, reflecting the accuracy of the values ‚Äã‚Äãcalculated from the sample against the population. A small standard error means that the sample mean/mean spread is also small, so the estimate of the population parameter is accurate. Based on our assessment, some employees need to understand the significance of EBITDA for project management. Less than 70% of the SBC respondents initially agreed to incorporate EBITDA into WBS and apply the target EBITDA margin in WBS and the Work Package to optimize EVM. The SBC is still in the early stages of integrating EBITDA and EVM using its information technology system, the ITS. Significant improvements were observed after nearly a year of focusing on integrating EVM into income statements and maximizing daily EBITDA in the EVM system project management. The respondents concur that EBITDA is the appropriate measure for project management profitability. The consensus among respondents was that the company could enhance daily EBITDA project management in the EVM system by integrating EBITDA as a target in business processes and work breakdown structures (WBS). Concerning management practices, when proposing a program like integrating EVM into an income statement in project management, managers consider the expected costs of adoption against the expected benefits. The new system‚Äôs speed and ease of adoption will depend on corporate and national cultures [86]. It is strategically advantageous to incorporate EBITDA into every Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and Work Package. This integration allows the management team to effectively oversee job assignments. When combined with Earned Value Management (EVM), this approach can significantly enhance profitability by improving efficiency and productivity. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS aligns project management and financial systems. This common language enables leaders to cultivate a robust corporate culture, enhance efficiency, and improve productivity for superior performance and profitability. By comparing EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends before and during project management execution, organizations can make informed decisions about resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio. Despite the importance and widespread nature of projects, there is currently little space devoted to project management research in leading business and management journals. We need more research for systemic approaches to projects, situating them in broader organizational landscapes. Addressing grand challenges involves changing project management practices to create and distribute value among diverse stakeholders [3]. The principles of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are accessible to all project management professionals and can be applied across various business and management domains. It is hoped that professionals in fields other than project management will adopt these concepts. This study demonstrates that incorporating EVM into income statements can enhance project management profitability, reduce information asymmetry, and garner support from stakeholders for making strategic decisions to ensure project management success. Specifically, this integration allows project managers to optimize Daily EBITDA within each Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and achieve improved performance and profitability. Integrating EVM into the income statement was challenging and required a shift in organizational culture. However, after eleven months of focusing on maximizing daily EBITDA within the EVM system, there was a notable improvement in understanding the concept based on the survey responses from participating companies. The study also highlights that EBITDA is a suitable metric for assessing project management profitability, as it is within the control of Operations Management and Project Management. Conversely, factors such as depreciation, amortization, interest, and taxes fall under the purview of the board of directors rather than operations management. Furthermore, by incorporating EBITDA as a target within each WBS, companies can effectively maximize daily EBITDA in project management within the EVM system, providing a clear view of profitability daily. This integration will facilitate communication between project management professionals and business management and foster greater acceptance of project management concepts within the business and management fields. Hopefully, this will also encourage dialogue between project management scholars and those in related disciplines, particularly business and management. The integration of EVM into income statements and EBITDA into WBS not only combines the project management and financial systems but also integrates the language of both fields, enabling leaders to foster a strong corporate culture, improve efficiency, and enhance productivity for better performance and profitability. The Organization can improve its decision-making regarding resource allocation priorities in each WBS Project portfolio by conducting a thorough comparison of EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and their respective trends both before and during project management execution. This study provides valuable insights and evidence-based ideas about project management and can potentially enhance its use in the business and management sectors. The author‚Äôs unique contribution lies in integrating EVM into the income statement with EBITDA into WBS. This research ensures we can apply the theoretical concepts effectively in practical settings with broader implications. The implications of Earned Value Management (EVM) and Project Management theory are understandable to any project management professional and can be applied across various business and management sectors. It is hoped that professionals in fields beyond project management will embrace these concepts. These topics warrant further in-depth exploration in future research. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s001 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s002 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s003 (DOCX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s004 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s005 (XLSX) https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0312956.s006 (DOCX)

Title: Is AI A Boom, Bubble, Or Con? Here‚Äôs What The Evidence Suggests
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnrau/2025/01/03/is-ai-a-boom-bubble-or-con-heres-what-the-evidence-suggests/

Robot and young woman face to face. Everyone knows that the stock market‚Äôs super-run in recent years has revolved around seven core stocks: The ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù of Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (in alphabetical order). Most of the seven, if not all, are assumed to be the beneficiaries of the stupendous growth of artificial intelligence. The ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù have a combined market value of more than $17 trillion, and accounted for over half of the S&P 500‚Äôs total return in 2024. Over the last five years, all seven have seen annualized appreciation rates of 20 percent or more, with Tesla hitting 73 percent and Nvidia exceeding 90 percent. Is this sustainable? How does it all end? And what does it say about the AI boom that plays a pivotal role in the seven‚Äôs success? Two years ago, I published a Forbes column about Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX, and the bitcoin mania. Back then, the price of a single bitcoin hovered around $20,000, while it hovers around $100,000 today. Then, like now, a key question was being asked: Is bitcoin a boom, a bubble, or a ‚Äúcon‚Äù? The Wall Street Journal‚Äôs Vicky Ge Huang recently compiled the warnings that some of the world‚Äôs great investors gave the public about cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and yet the $100,000 valuation suggests we‚Äôre not listening. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has called bitcoin a useless ‚Äúpet rock,‚Äù while Citadel CEO Ken Griffin wonders aloud, ‚ÄúWhat problem does it solve for our economy?‚Äù But what about AI? Is artificial intelligence something that the truly sophisticated suspect to be another bubble, and we‚Äôre ignoring that risk? Or is AI an actual boom, and the question is how and when the ‚Äúlanding‚Äù comes? My conclusion is the latter. AI is a real investment in something that even less experienced investors can understand where big-league returns may arise. From medical applications to breakthroughs in content creation or computer science, AI is already revolutionizing the world of work, and there‚Äôs no reason for the innovation to stop now. And yet, will the returns be big enough or likely enough to warrant the kind of investment it now takes to ‚Äúget in the game‚Äù? That‚Äôs where I get more skeptical. There is a long list of things that have to go right for the value creation of the magnitude assumed by today‚Äôs AI pricings to materialize: One thing is clear: AI is a very real and transformative technology, but scale will be integral to addressing such problems. The market will only want‚Äîand can only afford‚Äîfour or five surviving players. As product competition leads to commoditization, competitive pricing and the ability to ‚Äústay current‚Äù will be the keys to survival. As always, a select few investors will make enormous sums of money either by riding the wave and getting out of the water in time, or picking one of the ultimate survivors and hanging on for the ride. Countless start-ups and venture capital firms will see 100 percent losses as they stall out on scale or fall outside the cone of competitive capability. However, all of the evidence suggests AI is neither a bubble nor a con; it is a boom with lasting potential. While there is plenty of irrational exuberance related to AI, that is the free market‚Äôs way of experimenting and learning, which have always given the U.S. economy its edge. AI‚Äôs biggest winners will have solutions that address real problems and create new forms of competitive advantage, and we should be ready for those benefits to materialize in the coming years. On the other hand, hindsight will become 20-20 for the losers who assumed it was a ‚Äúsure thing.‚Äù When only a few numbers will come up winners, I don‚Äôt see anyone winning by placing bets across the board. AI will be a long-term winner for a select‚Äîand potentially magnificent‚Äîfew who successfully sell their wares with scale to customers who happily pay for the cost and productivity gains they will create.

Title: The Morning After: FCC‚Äôs attempt to restore net neutrality didn't work

The Sixth Circuit US Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the FCC does not have the "statutory authority" to implement net neutrality rules. Since the rules were established in 2015, the FCC argued that classifying ISPs as "telecommunication services" gives it broad authority to regulate them. The decision to redefine ISPs as "information services" during the first Trump Administration led to the repeal of net neutrality in 2017. The current FCC voted to restore net neutrality on April 25 last year. The difference between 2015 and now is the Supreme Court's recent, radical reinterpretation of an important legal doctrine. The Chevron doctrine said that if Congress doesn't weigh in on an issue, courts are supposed to defer to the interpretation of government agencies. Now, interpretation falls to the individual judge, and the Sixth Court doesn't agree with the FCC. This is the end of the road for the FCC‚Äôs attempts to wrench a little bit of the power from internet providers and carriers and level speeds and access regardless of service. Net neutrality rules will remain in California and other states, but anything at the federal level will require either an act of Congress or, for this case, be appealed to (and succeed in front of) the Supreme Court. ‚Äì Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox.

The clips were said to include medical information, criminal activities and even ‚Äúsexual encounters.‚Äù Reuters notes that $95 million in cash amounts to about nine hours of profit for the company.

The shake-up comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and it's the latest sign of how tech companies are positioning themselves for a new administration in Washington. Clegg, a former British deputy prime minister, said he is stepping down, citing the new year as the right time to move on. He'll be replaced by Kaplan, who will take on the title of chief global affairs officer. Kaplan was White House deputy chief of staff under former President George W. Bush, and he appeared at the New York Stock Exchange with Vice President-elect JD Vance and Trump in December. He also attended Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing in 2018 as a personal friend, causing a controversy for the social media company. "I will look forward to spending a few months handing over the reins ‚Äî and to representing the company at a number of international gatherings in Q1 of this year," Clegg wrote in a memo to his staff that he shared on Facebook on Thursday. Clegg joined the company in 2018 after a career in British politics with the Liberal Democrats party, and he helped Meta navigate incredible scrutiny, especially over the company's influence on elections and its efforts to control harmful content. Clegg also helped steer the company through the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which Facebook shared user data with third-party political consultants. He also represented the company in Washington and London, frequently at panels for artificial intelligence and at congressional hearings. "My time at the company coincided with a significant resetting of the relationship between 'big tech' and the societal pressures manifested in new laws, institutions and norms affecting the sector," Clegg wrote. In his note, Clegg said Kevin Martin, a former Federal Communications Commission chairman, would replace Kaplan as Meta's vice president of global policy. He mentioned that Kaplan would work closely with David Ginsburg, the company's vice president of global communications and public affairs. "Nick: I'm grateful for everything you've done for Meta and the world these past seven years," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement. "You've ... built a strong team to carry this work forward. I'm excited for Joel to step into this role next given his deep experience and insight leading our policy work for many years."

Title: Report: Apple Has Halted Production Of Its Colossally Expensive Vision Pro VR
URL: https://kotaku.com/apple-vision-pro-vr-mixed-reality-report-1851731279
Time Published: 2025-01-02T18:15:00Z
Full Content:
Apple has certainly carved itself a market for selling extremely well-made products at ludicrously high prices. Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it‚Äôs perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn‚Äôt. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production. This is all based on a report from October 2024 on The Information (a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release. The Vision Pro‚Äôs failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don‚Äôt want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you‚Äôd have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn‚Äôt do that either. Back in October, The Information said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they‚Äôd supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with ‚Äútens of thousands of undelivered parts‚Äù filling the suppliers‚Äô warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros‚Äîa figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple‚Äôs tech. If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As MacRumors points out, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it‚Äôs likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely. Meta‚Äôs relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame. We‚Äôve contacted Apple for a comment. .

Title: The 14 predictions that came true in 2024 ‚Äî and the 10 that didn‚Äôt

It requires resources, dedication, and independence. And that‚Äôs where you come in. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The 24 forecasts we made in 2024, revisited. by Bryan Walsh, Dylan Matthews, Marina Bolotnikova, Sigal Samuel, Kenny Torrella, and Izzie Ramirez Making predictions is a tricky business, and here at Future Perfect, we don‚Äôt pretend to have a crystal ball. But we do think there‚Äôs real epistemic value in putting our forecasts out there and ‚Äî just as importantly ‚Äî owning up to how they turned out. (Something that happens too rarely in the media, as we learned after November‚Äôs election.) Looking back at our predictions for 2024, we had a wild ride trying to anticipate a year that threw more than a few curveballs our way. For 2024, we made 24 predictions in total, covering everything from who would win the White House to whether Elon Musk could actually get those Cybertrucks on the road. When the dust settled, we got 14 right and 10 wrong ‚Äî batting .583. That‚Äôs Shohei Ohtani on a hot streak, though down somewhat from our 2023 results. But I did say it was a topsy-turvy year. Some calls were right on the money, though. We correctly saw Trump‚Äôs comeback and the GOP taking back the Senate. We nailed it when we said Oppenheimer would grab Best Picture (I mean, who didn‚Äôt love watching Cillian Murphy brood for three hours?). And we were spot-on about some big international news, like Claudia Sheinbaum making history as Mexico‚Äôs first woman president and Modi keeping his grip on power in India. But hey, nobody‚Äôs perfect. We thought the FDA would greenlight MDMA therapy for PTSD ‚Äî that was a swing and a miss. We seriously underestimated how many Cybertrucks Tesla would crank out. And while we got some tech predictions right (looking at you, Waymo and SpaceX), we whiffed on predicting OpenAI‚Äôs moves. The whole point isn‚Äôt just to keep score ‚Äî it‚Äôs about getting better at this prediction thing through practice and learning from our mistakes. And in a world that seems to get more unpredictable by the day, we think that‚Äôs a pretty useful skill to develop. ‚ÄîBryan Walsh I like to imagine that at least one incredibly sheltered person is learning this fact from this article: Donald Trump was elected to a second nonconsecutive term as president. There wasn‚Äôt much courage or confidence in this prediction, which I put at only 55 percent odds. My basic approach was to try to use a political science model incorporating national polling, and I came up with a prediction of a narrow Trump victory. President Joe Biden was fairly unpopular, and Trump was narrowly leading him in polling. I wasn‚Äôt confident that advantage would persist ‚Äî but it did. I will say that if I had updated my prediction throughout the year, it would have changed a lot. I remember in June, before the disastrous Biden-Trump debate, telling friends I gave Trump a 75 percent chance to win; after the debate, I bumped it up to around 90 percent. When Vice President Kamala Harris replaced Biden and surged in polling compared to her predecessor, I reverted to something like 50-50 odds. The actual race and its contours were changing dramatically, and my sense of the race changed dramatically too. Almost by coincidence, the ultimate election wound up being the narrow contest that polling would‚Äôve predicted at the end of 2023. ‚ÄîDylan Matthews I think my past self explained the reasoning here well: ‚ÄúThere are many, many ways for Republicans to retake the Senate. Everything has to go right simultaneously for Democrats to keep it.‚Äù Everything did not go right simultaneously for Democrats this election. They had already lost a seat forever when Joe Manchin decided to retire in West Virginia, a place where no other Democrat-caucusing candidate could ever win, which left them with a 50-seat maximum in 2024. Then they lost Sherrod Brown in Ohio and Jon Tester in Montana, red states that were going to be tough for Democrats to hang on to in a presidential election year. Then, in something of a shock, Pennsylvania‚Äôs Bob Casey was defeated by a private equity multimillionaire who doesn‚Äôt really live in the state and can‚Äôt tell the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers apart. When that guy wins, you know Democrats are having a bad year. On the plus side, it could‚Äôve been much, much worse for Democrats. Despite Harris losing Arizona, Democrat Ruben Gallego won the Senate race there narrowly. Tammy Baldwin barely hung on in Wisconsin, and Elissa Slotkin won an open seat in Michigan by 0.3 percentage points, even as those two states went for Trump. If the Senate results had followed the presidential map, Republicans would have a 56-seat majority and no trouble confirming anyone Trump wants in his Cabinet. Instead, they ended up with 53 seats, which might be just small enough to cause Trump actual trouble. ‚ÄîDM My reasoning here was that Republicans held a very small majority in the House going into the election, and Democrats seemed likely to pick up a number of seats in New York in particular due to redistricting. Sure enough, the party picked up three seats in New York, but lost others to pick up only one seat on net ‚Äî not enough to flip the chamber. In my defense, I was clear this might happen, writing, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs still an easy-to-imagine world where Republicans hold the House, especially if Trump wins the presidential race and if he pulls out a popular vote victory this time.‚Äù As it happens, that is the world we live in. But with 220 Republicans in the House and 218 needed to pass anything, there might not be much that Trump can do with this majority. ‚ÄîDM I have not always had the best track record when it comes to inflation predictions, but this one worked out. It was clear in 2023 that inflation had started to decline rapidly in the wake of the Fed‚Äôs interest rate hikes, and that decline continued through 2024, enough so that the Fed was able to start cutting again. By the Fed‚Äôs preferred measure ‚Äî the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy ‚Äî prices grew by 2.8 percent from October 2023 through October 2024. That‚Äôs an annual rate below 3 points, though not by a whole lot. The Fed‚Äôs goal is to get the number down to 2 percent. I find it hard to see prices stabilizing that much, especially if tariffs from the Trump administration cause consumer prices to spike in a one-off event. But we‚Äôre clearly doing better than a few years ago. ‚ÄîDM I like to make this prediction mainly to draw our readers‚Äô attention to the scandalous number of Americans killed by our transportation system. In 2023, according to statistics released this year by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, that number dropped by about 3.6 percent from 2022, to a still-abysmal 40,990, a figure that remains significantly elevated after a Covid-era spike erased more than a decade of progress in reducing car crash deaths. How many is that, exactly? It‚Äôs about as many Americans as are killed by guns and more than double the number killed in homicides overall, though it‚Äôs far fewer than the numbers of Americans who die from diseases like heart disease and cancer. It‚Äôs twice the number of people killed by cars in the European Union, even though the EU has 100 million more people. And the federal car fatality statistics are actually around 10 percent lower than the true number of Americans killed by cars because they exclude some cases, including crashes on private roads and parking lots. If today‚Äôs rates remained steady, a rough estimate would suggest that about 1 percent of all Americans would be killed by cars ‚Äî a stunningly high cost of admission into our car-dependent society. ‚ÄîMarina Bolotnikova I almost always predict that Netanyahu will stay in power, but I made an exception when writing last year‚Äôs predictions because the Israeli public was so incredibly furious at him after Hamas‚Äôs October 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Polls were showing that voters wanted him out ‚Äî by a wide margin. I figured if ever there was a time when he could be pushed out, this was it. But even this wasn‚Äôt enough. Israel has a parliamentary system, where governments typically form on the basis of coalitions. Netanyahu is really, really good at pacifying his allies in the governing coalition ‚Äî and they have kept him in power. ‚ÄîSigal Samuel Climate change is very obviously making its effects felt. This summer was the hottest on record globally. By November, scientists said this year is ‚Äúvirtually certain‚Äù to break 2023‚Äôs record. They also noted that 2024 marks the first year that Earth is more than 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than in the pre-industrial period. Sadly, this prediction was a pretty solid bet: You can make it every year and you‚Äôll get it right about 80 percent of the time. As my colleague Kelsey Piper has noted, ‚ÄúThis is based on looking at the last 25 years of atmospheric temperature data: On average, in four out of five years, this prediction would be right.‚Äù ‚ÄîSS Modi secured a third straight term as India‚Äôs prime minister after this spring‚Äôs massive elections, which saw over 640 million voters turn out. It‚Äôs an achievement equaled only by India‚Äôs founding prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, and one that was about as easy to predict as any outcome in this record-breaking year of global elections. Modi rolled into the elections with an approval rating in the mid-70s, or roughly twice as high as Biden‚Äôs popularity around the same time. In a year when incumbent leaders around the world fell in election after election, Modi and his BJP party were a sure thing ‚Äî so much so that my only regret was not choosing a probability of 99 percent. Even so, this election did not turn out the way many prognosticators expected, myself included. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance secured a majority in Parliament with 293 seats, but that was well short of the 400 seats the alliance was shooting for. And the BJP itself only won 240 seats, a significant drop from the 303 seats it had won in the previous election. As a result, the party lost its solo majority in the lower house of parliament for the first time in 10 years. As my colleague Josh Keating wrote, the results were bad for Modi but good for India as a whole, showing that the world‚Äôs biggest democracy remains a democracy. An overwhelming victory would have fed into Modi‚Äôs growing authoritarian inclinations, which were on display this year as the Indian government attacked critics at home and abroad ‚Äî including in the US. India was a rare example in 2024 of the people successfully pushing back against a would-be autocrat. ‚ÄîBW There was no courage in the prediction that the massively popular, but term-limited, left-wing President Andr√©s Manuel Lop√©z Obrador (AMLO) would be succeeded by his prot√©g√©e, Claudia Sheinbaum, a past mayor of Mexico City and climate scientist. The polling, even that early on, showed Sheinbaum with a massive lead over challenger X√≥chitl G√°lvez, an indication of both Sheinbaum‚Äôs talent and the popularity of AMLO and his Morena party. Sheinbaum‚Äôs election was historic: She is not only the first woman elected president of Mexico, but the first Jewish person and (to the best of my knowledge) the first scientist. Climate advocates shouldn‚Äôt be too sanguine, though. Despite her professional background, Sheinbaum has no interest in shrinking the popular state-owned petroleum sector. ‚ÄîDM After the chaos of 2022, when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and 2023, when Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner Group of mercenaries mutinied and nearly took Moscow, 2024 was a less momentous year in the war. There were major shifts, to be sure: Ukraine seized part of the Kursk region in Russia, giving it Russian land it might be able to trade for Ukrainian territory now under Russian occupation, and North Korea sent troops to the front line, signaling both that Russia has serious allies in the war and that it‚Äôs desperate enough to call upon them. But there were no major battlefield breakthroughs, and one of the biggest goals of the Ukrainian military (splitting Russian troops on the Crimean peninsula from troops in the Donbas, the east of Ukraine) did not come to pass. Here is the map of military control I used in last year‚Äôs predictions: This is what the map looks like today: If you look carefully, you can see some modest differences between the maps. But overall, they‚Äôre nearly identical. The lines of control haven‚Äôt moved much in the past year, and with Trump ascending to office and seemingly hostile to extending aid to the Ukrainian military, the future is looking rather grim for Ukrainians defending their sovereignty. ‚ÄîDM I don‚Äôt feel too bummed about having erred in my prediction here because the FDA‚Äôs rejection came as a surprise to almost everyone involved. When I made this prediction a year ago, patients, therapists, and policymakers alike were anticipating that Lykos Therapeutics, the company trying to get MDMA-assisted therapy approved, would be successful. After all, Lykos had collaborated with the FDA on the trial design, and the latter had signed off on the methodology. But in March, a report raised fresh concerns about the trial design and unreported adverse events. In May and June, more researchers and advocates started to sound the alarm ‚Äî not just about the psychedelic part of psychedelic-assisted therapy but about the therapy part. Some went so far as to accuse Lykos of being a ‚Äútherapy cult,‚Äù one with a style that could increase risk to patients. Ultimately, the FDA responded to this new information by deciding not to approve Lykos‚Äôs application. ‚ÄîSS Did OpenAI release a whole lot of stuff in 2024? It sure did ‚Äî so much so that the company decided to rebrand 12 days during the holiday season this December as ‚ÄúShipmas,‚Äù releasing everything from ChatGPT Pro (a $200/month plan that includes unlimited access to its top model OpenAI o1) to its video creation model Sora to something called ‚ÄúSanta mode.‚Äù The blizzard of product shipping ‚Äî one matched by competitors like Google and Meta ‚Äî is a sign of what my colleague Kelsey Piper identified as a shift in AI, away from a single-minded focus on advancing technical progress and toward creating products that people will actually be able to use (and even more importantly, given how expensive frontier AI work is, actually buy). It came as concerns were growing over whether AI was hitting a scaling wall and AI companies were hitting ‚Äúpeak data.‚Äù But as I wrote last year, ‚Äúfor the purposes of this prediction, OpenAI will need to release a product called ‚ÄòChatGPT-5‚Äô ‚Äî no ‚ÄòChatGPT-4.5 Turbo‚Äô or whatever.‚Äù Whether because it was running out of data or because it didn‚Äôt want to lock itself into ever-escalating model versions, OpenAI did not. I‚Äôll take the L. ‚ÄîBW 2024 was a banner year for SpaceX‚Äôs Starship, which saw four test launches. The first in March is a difficult case for my prediction: While the launch itself was successful, the booster stage burned up while hurtling back to the ocean and the ship itself appears to have disintegrated at some point. I predicted that neither stage would ‚Äúexplode,‚Äù and it‚Äôs hard to know if either did in this test. They certainly didn‚Äôt operate the way SpaceX had hoped. Luckily for the company, and for my prediction, its three subsequent launches were all smashing successes. In its June 6 launch, the booster and second stage splashed down, intact, in the Gulf of Mexico and Indian Ocean respectively. The November 19 launch, viewed in person by SpaceX founder Elon Musk‚Äôs political ally Donald Trump, got the same results. But the one for the history books came on October 13, when the booster stage returned not to the Gulf of Mexico but to the very same launchpad in Texas from whence it came, where it was caught by two massive mechanical ‚Äúchopsticks.‚Äù Whatever else you think about Musk ‚Äî and I think a lot of negative things ‚Äî that was a fairly awe-inspiring achievement, and easily met my prediction that the Starship project would notch major successes this year. ‚ÄîDM I biffed this one pretty bad. For quarters one through three of 2024, Cybertruck sales totaled 28,250 in the US. Anecdotally, they seem to be everywhere in Washington, DC. My rationale was that the extremely unusual design of the truck, complete with a metal rather than painted exterior and a truly massive windshield, would prove challenging to produce at scale. Moreover, Tesla tends to operate with extreme delays, which made me pessimistic that it would meet its timelines for the vehicle. Ultimately, though, it‚Äôs a company with a lot of experience building EVs at scale, and the Cybertruck proved to be no exception. I did predict, however, that the nearly 4-foot ‚Äúmonowiper‚Äù used on the windshield would break down immediately in inclement weather. Guess what? Tesla had to launch a recall in June over exactly this. ‚ÄîDM The industry leader on self-driving cars, a sister company to Google, entered the year operating in San Francisco and Phoenix but had announced plans to expand to Los Angeles and Austin. The latter city has seen testing among Waymo‚Äôs own employees but is not yet available to the general public through either the Waymo One app or Uber (which has partnered with Waymo in Phoenix). In Los Angeles, however, driverless taxi rides are now widely available: In March, Waymo started letting Angelenos off its waitlist so they could hail rides, and as of November 12, anyone in LA County can use the service, without any waitlist. That fits my prediction that at least one city would see driverless rides become widely accessible the way they already were in SF and Phoenix. ‚ÄîDM Most antibiotics sold in the US don‚Äôt go to hospitals or pharmacies, but to farms. These antibiotics are used to make animals grow faster and keep them alive in overcrowded, unsanitary factory farms, and they‚Äôve given rise to new antibiotic-resistant ‚Äúsuperbugs.‚Äù When humans fall ill from these superbugs, the typical course of antibiotics may not do the trick to heal them. Former Future Perfect fellow Miranda Dixon-Luinenburg called the growth in antibiotic resistance a ‚Äúhidden epidemic.‚Äù Tracking the amount of antibiotics sold to meat producers is a good proxy for understanding whether we‚Äôre backsliding or making progress on this epidemic, and last year, I predicted antibiotic sales for livestock would have increased by 1 percent in 2023. Instead, they went down by 2 percent. It makes sense that they declined because beef production decreased by almost 5 percent, and cattle account for around 40 percent of livestock antibiotic sales, while pork production remained stable. (I predicted 2023 sales because data is delayed by about a year.) I more or less knew this would happen, as the US Department of Agriculture predicted decreased beef production, and they‚Äôre usually right about these things. Nevertheless, I ignored common sense and predicted livestock antibiotic sales would increase because they had been on the rise for the previous five years. It‚Äôs a mistake to assume that trend lines will always continue, and a lesson I‚Äôll incorporate into future predictions. ‚ÄîKenny Torrella Sadly, I was right on this one. Oatly‚Äôs stock has remained below $1.40 all year, hitting a low of just 61 cents in mid-November (it peaked at nearly $29 per share in the summer of 2021). It‚Äôs been a long fall from grace for the company that single-handedly made oat milk cool, moving it from the fringes of the dairy aisle to seemingly every coffee shop menu in America. As I wrote about last year, the company has been beset by manufacturing problems and an onslaught of imitators. And it just hit another roadblock: In early December, a UK judge decided that Oatly can‚Äôt use the word ‚Äúmilk‚Äù on its products after a UK dairy trade group sued the company over the matter. It‚Äôs part of a larger trend of the livestock industry‚Äôs effort to restrict how plant-based companies can market their products. In brighter news, the company recently reported its third-quarter revenue was up about 10 percent compared to 2023, with growth in the main regions in which it operates. Despite a flagging stock price, Oatly is down but not out. ‚ÄîKT The US egg industry is still headed toward a cage-free future, but in 2024, it moved slower in that direction than I thought it would. Instead of amounting to 45 percent of the egg supply, cage-free reached 40.3 percent, just a 1.5 percent increase from late 2023. I was confident it would reach 45 percent for three reasons: Since 2019, the share of egg-laying hens raised cage-free had been growing by about 5 percent annually, several states had cage-free laws ‚Äî banning the sale and production of caged eggs ‚Äî going into effect in 2024, and many large food companies had committed to a 100 percent cage-free egg supply by 2025. Why was I so off? I likely discounted the impact the bird flu has had on the US egg industry; in 2024, the virus resulted in the mass killing of 39.6 million hens ‚Äî almost triple that of 2023. I was also overconfident on corporate progress; according to the animal protection group the Humane League, many large food companies are behind on fulfilling their cage-free pledges. Lastly, I probably overestimated the impact of the 2024 state laws in Nevada, Oregon, and Washington; each have small egg industries and relatively small populations. We might see the pace of progress accelerate in 2025: The states implementing cage-free laws next year ‚Äî Michigan and Colorado ‚Äî have a slightly bigger combined population than the three states from last year and, more importantly, they have much bigger egg industries. Meanwhile, the country‚Äôs largest egg producer, Cal-Maine, will have a number of new cage-free farms going online in summer 2025. But the ongoing bird flu outbreak ‚Äî combined with the unpredictability of corporate pledges ‚Äî could shift the trajectory. ‚ÄîKT I hate that this is true, but I was right on this one two times over. More than 40 million chickens and turkeys were killed in the poultry industry‚Äôs H5N1 bird flu outbreak. And that‚Äôs just this year ‚Äî since the outbreak began in early 2022, over 120 million have been culled. Most of those are not killed by the avian flu itself; rather, any time there‚Äôs a single detection of the disease at a poultry facility, all of the birds are exterminated, often with gruesome methods, like literally overheating them to death with industrial heaters. Three years into this never-ending nightmare, both the factory farm industry and animal advocates are faced with the reality that the bird flu may be here to stay. And one disturbing development we couldn‚Äôt have predicted last year: H5N1 is now pervasive in another farm animal species, dairy cows, across the country. Next year, I think this disease will keep surprising us. ‚ÄîMB My reasoning here was based on criminal trials being incredibly unpredictable ‚Äî so while I thought it was more likely that at least one animal rights activist would be incarcerated than any other single outcome, I put the probability at less than 50 percent. The prediction was mostly a product of recency bias: Barely a month before we made our 2024 predictions, Wayne Hsiung, one of the most prominent US animal rights activists and a co-founder of the group Direct Action Everywhere (DxE), was convicted and sentenced to jail for his involvement in actions at two California factory farms. DxE activists have run many similar actions over the last decade, employing a strategy they call ‚Äúopen rescue,‚Äù in which they enter factory farms and other places where animals are exploited, remove a few animals and take them to live at a sanctuary, and invite confrontation with the criminal legal system. The first few criminal cases I covered involving the group ended in either dismissals or miraculous acquittals. But Hsiung‚Äôs 2023 jail sentence made it feel like the bill was coming due. This year, I suspected that a long-awaited DxE court case, involving the rescue of three beagles from a company that breeds them for animal testing, would end in prison time because I knew it would be harder for the activists to make a legal argument for acquittal than in farm animal cases. But sure enough, the case was dismissed shortly before trial. More DxE trials are scheduled for next year, but now I know better than to try to predict the outcome. ‚ÄîMB This was a big year for Billie! I didn‚Äôt predict her new album or extensive world tour, but it‚Äôs not rocket science to know that the academy loves her work. With a previous win for the James Bond theme she did back in 2020, the Song of the Year award was a shoo-in. This year‚Äôs Future Perfect 50 honoree and superstar is only missing a Tony and an Emmy for that sweet, sweet EGOT status. ‚ÄîIzzie Ramirez I was wrong on this one ‚Äî it wound up being Jennifer Lopez who looked beautiful in Schiaparelli. Whichever Kardashian-Jenner decided to read this and prove me wrong: noted. But honestly it‚Äôs better this way. J. Lo was a co-chair for the event alongside fashion darling Zendaya, so she needed the extra zhuzh. ‚ÄîIR What did I write last year? ‚ÄúThe Academy loves biopics, it loves period pieces, and for some reason, it weirdly loves modern films that feature black-and-white scenes.‚Äù To no one‚Äôs surprise, Oppenheimer ran away with the show at the 96th Academy Awards, winning seven Oscars, including Best Actor for Cillian Murphy, Best Director for Christopher Nolan, and yes, Best Picture. Hot dog! So, since explaining why something we knew would happen happened is pretty boring, I‚Äôm going to instead discuss an all-time-great Oppenheimer-related query posted on the subreddit r/NoStupidQuestions: Well, Rafe_Cameron_OBX, is it weird that your boyfriend watches Oppenheimer for as much as 15 hours a week? I think it depends on a few things. Does he obsessively watch and rewatch the bravura scene of the Trinity test? Has he started mumbling something about being ‚Äúdeath, destroyer of worlds‚Äù in his sleep? (Assuming he sleeps.) You say he always makes time for you, which is great, but does he insist on reciting lines from the Bhagavad Gita when he‚Äôs, uh, making time? While I‚Äôm hesitant to interfere in another person‚Äôs relationship, if the answer to any of these questions is ‚Äúyes,‚Äù I strongly suggest you drop him immediately. I‚Äôm worried that if he doesn‚Äôt get treatment he may progress to a more advanced stage of Christopher Nolanism and start making you watch Interstellar three to five times a week. ‚ÄîBW You don‚Äôt have to be Bill James to know that two-way baseball super-duper megastar Shohei Ohtani had a pretty good year in 2024, his first with the Los Angeles Dodgers, even though an elbow injury kept him from pitching. He hit .310, good for fifth in the majors. He recorded 130 RBIs (second in the majors) and had an OPS (on-base plus slugging percentage, the gold standard hitting stat) of 1.036, also good for second in baseball. He became the first player in major league history to hit more than 50 homers and steal more than 50 bases, becoming the only player in the 50/50 club. On September 19, he had what many people consider the single best offensive game in the 121-year history of Major League Baseball, going 6-for-6 with three home runs, two doubles, 10 RBIs, and two stolen bases. Oh, and he went on to win a championship, too. The one thing Ohtani did not do is the one thing I predicted he would do: lead the major leagues in home runs in 2024. Ohtani mashed 54 taters, which would have been good enough to at least tie for the majors lead in all but three of the past 24 seasons. Unfortunately, very big boy Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees took the crown this season with 58 home runs. I‚Äôll admit, my mistake here was forgetting that as spectacular as Ohtani is across the board in baseball, the 6-foot-7, 282-pound Judge is really, really good at mashing dingers, at least in the regular season. He flamed out in his championship series against Ohtani‚Äôs Dodgers, going 4-for-18 with just one homer and three RBIs, enraging Yankees fans across the country. So even though my prediction failed, I‚Äôd say advantage: Ohtani. ‚ÄîBW Correction, January 2, 2025, 10:25 AM ET: An earlier version of this story overstated the number of hens killed in the break flu outbreak in 2024.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains ‚Äî something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year ‚Äî making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year. Tesla had warned in 2023 that production growth would be "notably lower" in the year ahead, as Pras Subramanian noted in his roundup of Tesla's biggest news in 2024 (you can read that story here).

Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund‚Äôs call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund‚Äôs returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (‚Äúcleared derivatives‚Äù). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund‚Äôs counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (‚Äúclearing members‚Äù) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund‚Äôs investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund‚Äôs other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund‚Äôs investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund‚Äôs holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund‚Äôs expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ‚Äúnon-diversified,‚Äù it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX¬Æ, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund‚Äôs assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosure (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current ‚Äúspot‚Äù or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (‚ÄúADRs‚Äù). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX¬Æ‚Äôs investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX¬Æ‚Äôs investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX¬Æ), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX¬Æ, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current ‚Äúspot‚Äù or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund‚Äôs indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin‚Äôs price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund‚Äôs synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund‚Äôs indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund‚Äôs put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund‚Äôs returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund‚Äôs strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund‚Äôs potential losses from the Fund‚Äôs short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund‚Äôs losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund‚Äôs value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund‚Äôs investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (‚Äúcleared derivatives‚Äù). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (‚Äúclearing members‚Äù) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund‚Äôs investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund‚Äôs other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund‚Äôs investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund‚Äôs holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is ‚Äúnon-diversified,‚Äù it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund‚Äôs assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund‚Äôs synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund‚Äôs indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund‚Äôs NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund‚Äôs ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options‚Äô expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund‚Äôs NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund‚Äôs NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract‚Äôs expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund‚Äôs NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund‚Äôs options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund‚Äôs NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund‚Äôs NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Title: Stocks surged in 2024 even as Americans fretted over US economy

Returns from the tech-focused Nasdaq have frequently been impressive. Photo / Getty Images If you invested in the stock market in 2024, chances are you came out pretty well. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite index rose to record highs, as investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence fueled a massive bull run, and investors cheered the Federal Reserve‚Äôs shift to lower interest rates. Participants in 401(k) and 403(b) plans also benefited big, with Fidelity Investments reporting that account balances reached their highest averages on record. The stock market soared despite Americans‚Äô widespread discontent with the economy, highlighting a disconnect between the experiences of many US households and the performance of their investments. US markets outperformed those in Europe and Asia: The S&P 500 gained 23% this year, while the Shanghai Composite Index rose 13%, and the STOXX Europe 600 moved up 6%, earlier this week. The strong performance also came amid expectations of an economic slowdown in 2024. ‚ÄúThere were real concerns over the summer about whether we were once again heading for a hard landing and/or a recession,‚Äù said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. But in a way, those fears came at a good time, Bespoke Investment co-founder Paul Hickey said, because it helped push the Fed to ease monetary policy. ‚ÄúIt almost panicked the Fed into cutting 50 basis points at its annual meeting‚Äù in September, Hickey said. Markets rallied further late in 2024, fuelled by what analysts say was exuberance over the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term. The president-elect punctuated the ‚ÄúTrump trade‚Äù when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in December, though stocks fell days later on signals that the Fed, rather than cutting interest rates further, planned to leave them at their current level for longer than many observers had expected. Here are the highlights of a momentous year in stocks. The S&P 500‚Ä≤s record gains in the first half of 2024 were driven by seven tech stocks that significantly outperformed the other companies on the index. The ‚ÄúMagnificent Seven‚Äù - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla - have an outsize effect on the S&P 500 because the index is weighted by market capitalisation, a shorthand for companies‚Äô size and value. The rest of the index started to catch up in the latter half of the year, a rally that showed ‚Äúit‚Äôs not just seven companies driving the entire economy,‚Äù Hickey said. But the technology and AI sectors continued to dominate investors‚Äô attention. And no stock captured their enthusiasm like AI chipmaker Nvidia, whose earnings calls have inspired rapturous takes from traders and casual investors alike. ‚ÄúEvery bull market has a theme, and the theme of this bull market has been AI,‚Äù Hickey said. Chris Rupkey, with Fwdbonds, said Nvidia‚Äôs juggernaut status has made it something of a bellwether for the broader market. ‚ÄúFollow the bouncing ball of Nvidia,‚Äù he said in August. ‚ÄúNvidia down, sell everything. Nvidia up, buy it all.‚Äù Nvidia‚Äôs growth has slowed in recent months and its stock has taken temporary hits after strong earnings reports, as analysts set exceedingly hard-to-meet expectations and some raise concerns that rampant spending on AI is creating a financial bubble. But some analysts say Nvidia will have staying power and catalyse further investment in AI. ‚ÄúThis is the fourth industrial revolution playing out across tech,‚Äù said Dan Ives, global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs led by Mag 7, but now software and cybersecurity players are getting in.‚Äù US stocks dipped, then surged, after the Fed cut interest rates by a half-percentage point in September, easing monetary policy for the first time since March 2020 amid signs that inflation was moderating. That, in turn, boosted consumer sentiment and took the edge off interest rates. ‚ÄúA funny thing kind of happened on the way to the recession and or economic slowdown that we all anticipated, which is basically that the [middle- and high-income] consumer just never flinched,‚Äù Samana said. US stocks jumped on the news that Trump would return to the White House after campaigning on promises to slash regulations. Companies expected to benefit under the Trump administration - such as private prison company Geo Group and Tesla, which is led by Trump adviser Elon Musk - leaped while renewable energy and pharmaceutical stocks sank in the immediate aftermath. But Hickey said the conventional wisdom about winners and losers in the market doesn‚Äôt always pan out when it comes to politics. ‚ÄúComing into the first Trump administration, you would have thought the energy sector would have done well,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was the worst performing sector.‚Äù Looking ahead, Hickey expects the industrial sector will perform well in 2025, especially if loosened regulations help lingering construction projects break ground - such as renewable energy proposals green-lit by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. ‚ÄúWhether it was Trump or Biden that was elected president, the overall trend in the economy is to bring more production back to the United States,‚Äù Hickey said. The biggest wild card going into 2025 is tariffs, said David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar. Trump has said he intends to impose a blanket tariffs on imports, but it‚Äôs unclear what countries or sectors would be covered and how much of the promise is campaign rhetoric. Bitcoin had a massive year - and that was especially reflected in the share price of MicroStrategy, a business software company that has snapped up several billions of dollars in bitcoin. The company‚Äôs stock is up more than 340% year to date, with much of those gains coming after the presidential election. Bitcoin itself began the year with a massive boost, as the Securities and Exchange Commission approved exchange-traded funds tied to the price of bitcoin. In the following months, bitcoin‚Äôs price nearly doubled, from around US$40,000 per coin in January to about US$73,000 per coin in March. The price largely held steady until Trump was elected to a second term. After the November election, bitcoin‚Äôs price soared and at one point surpassed US$100,000 per coin, a milestone cheered by the cryptocurrency community. The first and most valuable cryptocurrency is up more than 120%. . While Magnificent Seven stocks received big publicity this year, a few lesser-known companies dwarfed their gains - at least when it came to growth. Sezzle, a ‚Äúbuy now, pay later‚Äù company, is up more than 1000% on the year, with much of its gains coming after the November election, though some of those gains were wiped out in December when an activist short-selling firm released a report accusing the company of risky lending practices. Shares in NuScale Power, a nuclear power company focused on small modular reactors, is up more than 450% on the year. The rise reflects investor excitement over the transition to low-carbon energy sources, particularly new technologies such as NuScale‚Äôs designs. AppLovin, a mobile app development and marketing company, also had a banner year on Wall Street, with the companies‚Äô shares up more than 700% on the year. Analysts say the company has been able to wield AI to more effectively market apps. There was continued interest in Contact and Mercury ahead of an index change.
