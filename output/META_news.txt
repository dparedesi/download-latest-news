Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is upping the ante in the AI business, triggering a bidding war for talent and he’s willing to poach from competitors. Why? Well, like most of us, Mark is in hot pursuit of Godlike super intelligence. pic.twitter.com/0MqEqiiKpK — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Perfectly rational man in a perfectly rational society that has truly mastered rational resource allocation. pic.twitter.com/H58LvHoh7S — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 Ed Zitron summed up Zuckerberg’s recent moves and his overall strategy: Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, my previous subject in this King Idiots of AI mini-series squealed like a stuck pig: pic.twitter.com/LXfthZ4STJ — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 I really should quote a little from the NY Times piece I referenced above: In April, Meta released two new versions of Llama, asserting that the models performed as well as or better than comparable ones from OpenAI and Google. To prove its claim, Meta cited its own testing benchmarks. On Instagram, Mr. Zuckerberg championed the releases in a video selfie. But some independent researchers quickly deduced that Meta’s benchmarks were designed to make one of its models look more advanced than it was. They became incensed. Mr. Zuckerberg later learned that his A.I. team had wanted the models to appear to perform well, even though they were not doing as well as hoped, people with knowledge of the matter said. Mr. Zuckerberg was not briefed on the customized tests and was upset, two people said. His solution was to throw more bodies at the problem. Meta’s A.I. division swelled to more than 1,000 people this year, up from a few hundred two years earlier. The rapid growth led to infighting and management squabbles. And with Mr. Zuckerberg’s round-the-clock, hard-charging management style — his attention on a project is often compared to the “Eye of Sauron” internally, a reference to the “Lord of the Rings” villain — some engineers burned out and left. Executives hunkered down to brainstorm next steps, including potentially ratcheting back investment in Llama. In fairness to Meta, the NYT failed to mention that Ahmad Al-Dahle, VP of generative AI at Meta, said that it’s “simply not true” that Meta trained its Llama 4 Maverick and Llama 4 Scout models on “test sets.” And if you can’t trust the fine folks at Meta, who can you trust? But I don’t want to dismiss Zuckerberg too cavalierly. I’m a serial sucker taking things at face value, investing based on business fundamentals and underlying product value, and betting on professional wrestling. He’s a stone playa who read the true nature of this society at a very early age, from The Harvard Crimson, 2003: The creator of the short-lived but popular Harvard version of the Am I Hot or Not? website said he will not have to leave school after being called before the Administrative Board yesterday afternoon. Mark E. Zuckerberg ’06 said he was accused of breaching security, violating copyrights and violating individual privacy by creating the website, www.facemash.com, about two weeks ago. The charges were based on a complaint from the computer services department over his unauthorized use of on-line facebook photographs, he said. Zuckerberg said he will not be forced to withdraw or leave school for any amount of time, but declined to elaborate on whether the board took some lesser action. …“I understood that some parts were still a little sketchy and I wanted some more time to think about whether or not this was really appropriate to release to the Harvard community,” Zuckerberg wrote in an e-mail to The Crimson earlier this month. After taking it down, Zuckerberg decided that criticism of the site was too strong to re-post it. “Issues about violating people’s privacy don’t seem to be surmountable,” he wrote at that point. “I’m not willing to risk insulting anyone.” The site was created entirely by Zuckerberg over the last week in October, after a friend gave him the idea. The website used photos compiled from the online facebooks of nine Houses, placing two next to each other at a time and asking users to choose the “hotter” person. Students were ranked within the general Harvard community and individual Houses according to attractiveness. Zuckerberg hacked into House websites to gather the photos, and then wrote the codes to compute rankings after every vote. The programming and algorithms that made the site function were Zuckerberg’s primary interest in creating it, he said. After creating the website, Zuckerberg forwarded the link to a few friends for advice. But the link then was sent out on several campus group list-serves, and traffic skyrocketed. In the course of one day, the number of visitors quadrupled—by 10 p.m., the site had been visited by 450 people, who voted at least 22,000 times. The part I love about the story above is the way Zuckerberg is the only source quoted. Those Harvard educated journalists are allowed to be awful from the get. She also didn’t report the blog post he put up the night he launched the site: “I’m a little intoxicated, not gonna lie. So what if it’s not even 10 p.m. and it’s a Tuesday night? What? The Kirkland [dorm] facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous facebook pics. I almost want to put some of these faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on which is more attractive. By the time of his 2018 congressional testimony Zuck had gotten some press training: Zuckerberg, 33, paused and smirked. “No, congressman. FaceMash was a prank website that I launched in college, in my dorm room, before I started Facebook,” he said. “You put up two pictures of two women and decided which one was the better, more attractive of the two, is that right?” Long asked. Zuckerberg responded, with an emphasis on his youth at the time: “That is an accurate description of the prank website that I made when I was a sophomore in college.” Ok, so he’s always been ruthless, shrewd and openly anti-social but I’m not sure he’s really that smart. Social media had been pioneered by MySpace, Friendster and several other companies long before Zuckerberg allegedly stole the idea for Facebook from classmates. Facebook primarily rose to the top because of three factors: Since launching Facebook, his biggest wins have come from buying budding competitors like Instagram and WhatsApp more than from any internally created ideas. Never forget, this is the same guy who spent $47 billion in five years on “the Metaverse.” He clearly cannot tell a good idea from a bad one. He’s explained his recent AI spending spree to investors (who have no ability to depose him) in April: “The major theme right now, of course, is how AI is transforming everything we do.” At the same time, Meta upped its capital expenditures range for the year to between $64 billion and $72 billion from between $60 billion and $65 billion to reflect more data center investments in AI and potentially higher hardware costs. What Zuckerberg didn’t say then is that he was about to start shelling out mounds of cash to revamp his AI organization. “Mark Zuckerberg is in founder mode and he’s not going to be stopped,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at D.A. Davidson, in an interview on Friday with CNBC’s “Money Movers.” Luria has a buy rating on the stock, but said that to win in AI, Meta needs to be successful with the next round, with the dream team that they’re building.” I had to include the hypersonic quote from D.A. that CNBC featured. I’m sure it made great TV. It wouldn’t be American corporate media if it didn’t feature interchangeable hustlers competing to spout the most ridiculous nonsense in the most simplistic terms. They’re all like a TV sportscaster talking to drunks at noon on a Sunday except with no contract and an urgent need to be invited back right away. Also making me doubt Zuckerberg’s wisdom was his recent, much publicized decision to hire the Ultimate Fighting Championship’s CEO Dana White to be a board member for a reported seven figure stock and cash compensation package. Although there was some logic behind that decision. From The MMA Draw, a publication aimed at investors in the fight sports industry: This well-planned and well-executed attention-getter kicked off Meta’s 2025 with a bang. That’s right, Meta, a company with a $1.59 TRILLION market cap has brought America’s best-known fight promoter (and wife-beater) on their board of directors. The collective “WTF?!?” spawned headlines and social media posts all over the Internet. Based on this round-up of headlines from Google News, the mainstream media already has a theory and it has to do with a certain newly re-elected President celebrating a big anniversary on January 6th. pic.twitter.com/zQb8SgdvWq — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 4, 2025 It’s also, according to The MMA Draw, part of Zuckerberg personally rebranding himself for the Trump era: Reason #2: Zuck Is Getting Based 2024 saw Mark Zuckerberg embark on what Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian called “a wider strategic overhaul of the tech mogul’s public image.” She also explained why Zuckerberg might be doing this: Meta is embroiled in an anti-monopoly lawsuit and is being sued by dozens of states alleging that Facebook and Instagram are exploiting children to boost profits. Far better, don’t you think, that we all talk about how handsome a bearded Zuck would be rather than dwell on Meta’s less attractive business practices? Honestly, it’s been a pretty incredible rebranding campaign for Zuckerberg, scoring wins by showing off his wakeboarding, flag-waving, and beer-drinking mastery. Anyone who remembers Zuckerberg’s pathetic attempt to launch himself as a potential political candidate in 2017 should be impressed by how dramatically he’s improved his PR game. He’s even gotten favorable notice from the Twitter fashion guy. Zuck’s (seemingly genuine) fondness for training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a big part of this rebranding and a great excuse to pal around with Dana White. Zuckerberg been talking up his love for BJJ since at least this 2022 appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. Mark Zuckerberg on what he loves about BJJ: (It’s) a thing that is both super engaging physically but also intellectually and where you can’t afford to focus on something else. I think (it’s) the perfect thing because if you stop paying attention for one second you’re gonna end up on the bottom. So I’ve just found that is just really important for me in terms of what I do. Being able to maintain my energy level, maintain my focus… then after an hour or two of working out or rolling or wrestling with friends, now I’m ready to go solve whatever problem at work for the day. Zuckerberg has also medaled in a BJJ tournament and at one point even had Dana White calling up the Roman Colosseum looking for the right venue to host a bout between himself and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Naturally with 2020’s Zuckerberg, even the cage fight was vaporware. Caveat: The Market, aka the most effective price discovery system ever invented disagrees. pic.twitter.com/eGqayBw4If — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) July 5, 2025 Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. The dual share structure grants him dictatorial powers at Meta, meaning the guy has Imprimatur to do pretty much what he wants, including torching $47bn on what amounted to little more than a personal obsession with the metaverse, memory-holing that episode, and then lining up hundreds of billions more in his continuing quest for a defining “second act” that will secure his place amongst the pantheon of great innovators (as opposed to being known as the guy who stole the idea for facebook from a friend and has since built his empire on strangling emerging competitors in the crib). He’s as desperate for this second act as Trump is for a Nobel Peace Price. His strategy clearly rests on aggregating the critical inputs for AI supremacy ie data (expect Meta’s family of apps to be harvested for every last bit of training data, user privacy be damned), algorithms (Deepseek’s algorithmic breakthroughs shocked SV titans, including MZ, to their core, hence his poaching spree to build bench strength and an AI intellectual aristocracy within Meta to push forward the frontier of algorithmic discovery, which by the way, given Meta’s history, will likely mean just copying whatever the real frontier players are doing) and compute (data centre build out is the sport of kings and given his profligate pursuit of metaverse supremacy, the man can outspend an army of drunken sailors everyday and twice on Sunday). We sure do live in interesting times. https://youtu.be/_v3KiaAjpY8?feature=shared I would recommend this video in full as it does flesh out the whole notion of how one reinvents themselves (or as this video calls it – becoming a new guy) as part of the broadrler topic. It does address Zuck in particular around 42:37. Zuckerberg and the other techbros are looking several steps ahead, but they’re not great at watching their feet. Hey we saw the movie version, Aaron Sorkin on top of every PMC trend. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_social_network It’s not exactly warm and friendly toward Zuck but does seem enamored of Larry Summers. As for Zuckerberg’s trial and error business model that’s so very much a Silicon Valley thing is it not? Musk blows up a giant rocket and just shrugs. break things Contrast with Zuck against say, Bill Gates who quite famously took others ideas or seriously underpaid in hindsight, either is applicable. Good connections and voila, now IBM has a supplier in Microsoft for their software OS on this new idea called the PC…Mark just took the same steps but got to the wealthy billionaire level much quicker. So much to add about my personal experience but I enjoy many of the films directed or helmed by Fincher. Even the occasional dud or a film he disavowed, Alien 3 being a key example. Speaking of the Facebook/Zuck movie, it was recently rated as the 10th best movie of the 21st century by both fans and critics. I mean, I liked the movie OK, but 10th best of the (quarter) century? Not even close, and I don’t watch that many movies. https://uk.movies.yahoo.com/best-movies-21st-century-new-york-times-films-111414429.html I was listening to a podcast about AI and investing. Regardless of what you think about it, it is getting lots of attention from investors that don’t want to be left out. Meaning if you are not investing in it you look like a fool and they will take their money elsewhere. Never mind what China keeps doing with low cost AI. Whether he’s interested or not, he kinda has to go along with the narrative > Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Good Money After Bad #NitPick: Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg Loves To Throw Unearned, Magic Money Made Up Via Market Malfeasance After Bad It’s all Unicorn Rainbow Poop, designed via finacial chicanery to become high powered money. All of it, inflated value made real via stock “money”. That’s why he can pelt it around like tennis balls at a summer carnival trying to win prizes. Ugh. It’s family-blogging tragic when you think about it from the perspective of the public good being laid waste to by the US uni-party. And another “inception” subtext to all this is our collective sanitization of the term “billionaire”, and the notion of “a billion dollars”. And absolutely obscene amount of money that could fuel a thousand lifetimes, sadly made acceptable for one person to have in a single lifetime. #GuillotineWatch lost the last of 3 baby geese. and i stepped on a wire or something in the flooded road(tetanus vaxxed)…so my feets are both wrinkled and one is sorta sore. no other casualties. i am alone with the animals on this place. we’re all good. 23″. since thursday afternoon. 7-7-2025 so heres how it happened for me. july 3rd, afternoon, check weather, as usual. Looks like heavy rain and some flooding…so I decide, after evening chores…critters put up, etc…to sit out at the wilderness bar, drinking beer(started w a margarita(likker first!)) and rolled 4 little joints(lack of proper zigzags), and determined to watch the storm…as is my wont…..my fone is filled with vids of these often dramatic events…usually brief. This event didnt turn out to be brief,lol. When im out here, I have my laptop for music and for occupying myself with the web. And also for weather. First place I go when I get up(4am) is NWS and Wundermap, to see whats happening…and then I do this regularly, all day. So I had all my weather shit in one window…so i’m watching the storms IRL, and on the near real time radar. And a brief, relatively minor event, turned into a catastrophe….storms just sat there, dumping rain by the tankerfull…all over from here to kerrville. (turns out I got the most rain from this event…24” on my place, since thursday afternoon…more than kerr cnty..but I dont live on a river, nor have canyons). So I watched it rain…hard. Threw a tarp over the laptop and retreated(quite drunk and high, mind you) to the spots that generally stay dry. And it just kept on raining, superhard. Im from houston, and ive spent a lot of time in a vw van all over the gulf coast, and ive never seen a monsoon, before, save in films. Thats what this was like…bangladesh. So im out here, 5 sheets to the wind(by now, im sipping tequila…because why the hell not?) watching this incredible monsoon hammer down and I remember thinking, “ well, this aint what they predicted”. So I watched and watched…and soon, I heard a sound that I know well…rushing water…like over a rapids at a river. But way out here. It was the road and my almost always dry gully…which is not connected(for 40 years) to any current drainage system in this watershed. I had a pond…but filled with rushing water, calf-high…and so did the road,,,,and it stayed that way for…well…well into the next day(saturday), and I couldnt get to the highway until sunday. Im 20+ miles from the Llano river, maybe 12 from the San Saba. We do flood, due to the hills…but rarely anything like this. But we dont have canyons…and we have more silt…often deep, between the hills, instead of the limestone caliche that they have down there(about 50 miles as crow flies from me, to my southwest) Its now monday evening, july 7th…and it only stopped raining about 4 hours ago. Ive had some breaks…such to pick squash and zukes and a whole lotta green beans to can…and ive been to the highway, to look at the dirt road…torn up, but passable once the water ran off. That was saturday midday, I think,lol. Maybe sunday///it all runs together. \ive had intervals where I could go out and do farmer things…but then it rains again. I was out in the worst of it…thursday night, all day friday….half of that time drunk as a skunk,,,with a headlight, crocs and naked(why get yer clothes wet?) and checking on the critters….and just surveying what was going on. I am currently alone on this place…mom’s been at galveston for a week now, with my brother and his brood. This is NOT how I wanted to spend my vacation from her,lol. I’ve got a leaky house…due to being bad at roofing,lol…so my house is wet and moldy. Take a week of fans and dry weather to even begin. But I aint in kerrville, or comfort, or any of a thousand little wide spots in the road(and real cities, too) who have had it much, much worse than I. I feel for those folks…and recognise immediately many of the places in all the vids out there. I have lived out here in the texas hill country for 30 and a half years, now. I know this place, this area, this region. In that time, ive seen catastrophic floods…more often than not, along the guadalupe. But ive never seen anything as catastrophic as this. Pray, or send $, or sacrifice a chicken or whatever. A hurricane came to the middle of texas. So glad to hear from you and that beyond some very annoying property damage, you came through OK! We missed your comments. It reminded me of childhood when a tooth came out and before the adult tooth erupted you keep noticing the gap. The mouth is functional but incomplete….. that’s probably a stupid analogy but just woke up. Here in middle England we are supposedly about to enter phase 2 of our summer record breaking heatwave. This time round my dad has been a total star and I have portable A/C unit now fully set up with appropriate window covering for exhaust fan set up. Hardly very environmentally friendly but after attending a meetup group of locals and seeing where the mood of this country is taking us, I don’t feel very inclined to do my bit anymore for the next generation. UK entering FAFO phase. glad you are for the most part ok Was hoping you and your’n were ok… and glad to hear it’s so… Glad you survived, what a storm! What a tale to tell… Glad everything is jake~ Glad to hear that you made it though the storm OK. Lots of people were asking after you the past coupla days and were worried about you. Guess that you have a boat load of repairs and work to do now that the storm has abated. You wonder if this will be the last such storm that you will see or if there will be more such storms down the track. #Amen Facebook’s ethical failures are not accidental; they are part of the business model https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8179701/ Your email address will not be published.

It’s likely to be the latter more often. But the opposite is true, as well: We also believe that the best place to hire from is the competition. Just recently, Meta’s new division — with an eye on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) — announced 11 key hires from arch rivals like OpenAI, Anthropic and Google. If reports are to be believed, Mark Zuckerberg has been personally leading the hiring campaign by hosting some of the potential hires at his home. This prompted OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to claim that Meta offered $100 million signing bonuses to some of his employees. And Meta isn’t alone. The move echoes industry-wide trends. This year alone, Microsoft spent $650 million acquiring much of Inflection AI’s team while Amazon hired the co-founders of Adept, a start-up developing AI-powered agents. Begs the question whether anti-compete contracts aren’t at play? In a recent case of a software engineer vs his former employer, the Delhi High Court ruled that the non-compete clauses blocking job switches are not enforceable. The court said that Section 27 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, clearly says that any agreement that restrains anyone from exercising a lawful profession, trade or business shall be void. A research handbook published by the leading global law firm DLA Piper offers insights into anti-compete laws worldwide. Interestingly, among the 34 major countries they studied, only in five, including India, are the non-compete employment contracts non-enforceable. But, just in case you have forgotten the fine print of your employment contract and want to browse it again, you will find an anti-compete clause glaring at you. Did the MNCs bring their global template to India and were we only too happy to copy and paste it from entry-level jobs to senior leaders, making no distinction between the dictates of the roles and the laws of the land? Cognizant’s hiring of Wipro’s former CFO sparked a legal battle, which eventually got settled after nine months. The current legal proceedings between Cognizant and Infosys, involving allegations of anti-competitive practices in the US healthcare IT market, show that the stakes are high for these enterprises. When firms lose leaders who hold key customer relationships or techies who have the IP to build new-age products or platforms at the competition, the threat is real. This may prompt organisations to protect their interests, which explains the suits. In spite of these potential legal exposures, why do boards still hire CEOs from the competition? The mindset of large enterprises with deep pockets is to ‘buy’ talent, rather than ‘build’ it, since this takes time, and the risks of a potential anti-compete suit are outweighed by the benefits of the hiring. The popular ask from hiring managers is “We want to recruit someone who hits the road running”. When Zomato wanted to boost its live events business, it didn’t promote someone internally— it hired the live events head from BookMyShow and designated him as Founder. Ditto Starbucks — within 17 months of hiring a new CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, it replaced him with a leader from Chipotle, and immediately its stock price went up by 20 per cent and has remained steady since. Even the stock market cheers when you hire from the competition. The hypocritical mindset of enterprise culture is hard to miss. We hire our top talent from rivals but internally we berate them on a regular basis to build the competitive spirit in our teams. Whenever we chest-thump about our products, services or employers, we can’t help but reference them against our competitors, and hence it’s emotionally hard to accept anyone amongst us joining a rival. Hence, we resort to practices like ‘garden leave’, immediate relieving, legal threats, and/or holding on to financial dues as a mark of retaliation. All these also send a ‘message’ to colleagues of the consequences of joining the competition. These over-the-top reactions breed a different set of behaviours among team members, who eventually start lying about their health and personal matters when they leave or join friendly employers briefly and eventually join competitors a couple of months later. I agree it’s an uphill task to eliminate the anti-compete clauses we have included in all roles within our enterprises. But can we take a leaf out of Belgium, where non-competition clauses are valid only if the employee earns an annual gross remuneration of at least €78,706? Day in and day out, our leaders talk about the strength of our brands, the legacy of the company, loyal customers, enviable culture, best financial rewards and, not to forget, the Best Employer certificates that we keep flashing. However, our employment contracts don’t reflect the same spirit that we find on our office posters. Are enterprises built with such weak foundations that one leadership movement to the competition can bring them down? What’s the fear? When sports clubs and premier leagues allow players to be bought and compete against the club where they were trained at, why not enterprises?

As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not.

Title: India-US Trade Deal, Q1 Results, FOMC Minutes: The Week Ahead

Time Published: 2025-07-06T08:47:17Z

Global developments will shape market sentiment in the coming week along with quarterly earnings. Among important events is the announcement of US-India trade deal. Along with US President Donald Trump’s move to inform trading partners about planned tariff rate. The US Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. The June 2025 quarter earnings season begins this week, with Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. set to announce its results. On the IPO front, Travel Food Services’ public issue opens for subscription, and Crizac is set to debut on the stock exchanges. Back home, Indian equities ended last week in the red amid caution around the India-US trade deal, foreign capital outflows, and the start of the earnings season. The Nifty formed a small bearish candle on the weekly chart, suggesting a phase of consolidation after recent gains. Analysts expect the index to trade with a positive bias within the 25,200–25,700 range, with stock-specific action likely to drive market direction. Benchmark indices broke a two-day losing streak to settle higher on Friday but on a weekly basis the Nifty 50 and Sensex declined over 0.75%. The NSE Nifty 50 ended 55.70 points or 0.22% higher at 25,461, while the BSE Sensex closed 193.42 points or 0.23% up at 83,432.89. This week, the broader market indices outperformed the benchmark indices, with the Nifty and Sensex experiencing declines after two consecutive weeks of gains. The Nifty Realty sector saw a significant drop of over 2%, making it the worst-performing sector of the week, with Macrotech Developers Ltd. and Brigade Developers leading the declines. Investor focus in the coming week will remain firmly on the uncertain India-US trade deal, with US President Donald Trump's July 9 deadline approaching. Despite months of negotiations, no breakthrough has been achieved, and it is expected that the deal will be announced in the coming week. Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal made it clear that India will not rush into any deal based on external deadlines, insisting that any agreement must be fully concluded and in the national interest. Markets are also preparing for the start of the fr=irst quarter earnings season. IT majors Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Tata Elxsi Ltd. will report their results during the week, offering early insights into sector performance amid ongoing global demand concerns. Retail giant DMart is scheduled to announce its results on Friday. Apart from corporate earnings, India’s weekly foreign exchange reserves, will be released on Friday. While investors wait for US President Donald Trump’s move ahead of the deadline of July 9, they will also track US Federal Reserve's minutes of its June policy meeting, and investors will track interest rate decisions from central banks in Australia and South Korea. US crude oil inventories will also be released on Wednesday. Additionally, the US will release the jobless claims data for the week ending July 5. UK will release its GDP date for the May. The primary market is set for a busy week with six new public issues lined up, including one major mainboard IPO and five SME offerings. The headline act is Travel Food Services, a Mumbai-based operator of airport lounges and quick-service restaurants across India and Malaysia. Its Rs 2,000 crore public issue opens on July 7, with a price band of Rs 1,045–1,100 per share. The offer comprises 1.82 crore existing shares, and investors must apply for a minimum of 13 shares. On the SME front, upcoming IPOs include GLEN Industries, Chemkart India, Smarten Power Systems, CFF Fluid Control, and Asston Pharmaceuticals. These smaller offerings aim to tap into investor appetite for niche, high-growth companies in specialised sectors. The listings provide a range of options for investors seeking opportunities outside of large-cap names. Several IPOs are also set to make their stock market debut this week. Pushpa Jewellers, Silky Overseas, Vandan Foods, Cedaar Textile, and Marc Loire will list on July 7. Crizac in the only main board listing in the week and will debut on July 9, followed by Cryogenic OGS and White Force on July 10, and Meta Infotech on July 11. The upcoming week is set to be active with various corporate actions, including several companies going ex-trade for dividends, bonus issues and rights issues. Investors looking to benefit from these actions should pay close attention to the ex-dates to ensure their eligibility. Key names in focus this week include HDFC Bank, Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., among others, all of which have record dates for final and special dividends coming up. Titan Co., JSW Steel Ltd., Mphasis Ltd., Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd., Apollo Tyres Ltd. and IDFC First Bank Ltd. are among the many stocks that will trade ex-dividend this week. Meghna Infracon Infrastructure Ltd., Alkosign Ltd., Dynamic Cables Ltd. and Roto Pumps Ltd. are scheduled to distribute bonus shares to their stakeholders, ahead of their respective record dates next week.

Title: The Force-Feeding of AI on an Unwilling Public

Time Published: 2025-07-06T06:19:41Z
Full Content:
A few months ago, I needed to send an email. But when I opened Microsoft Outlook, something had changed. Microsoft asked me to use Copilot to write my email. Copilot is my AI companion. (That’s the cute word they use.) Hey I don’t want a companion—especially not a fake AI buddy. I never asked for this. And what about the people receiving my emails? They don’t want this either. They want to hear from me, not a bot. How do I turn my companion off? After some trial-and-error, I found a way to disable Copilot. Phew! But a few days later, Microsoft surprised me again. It wouldn’t let me save an Excel file until I had agreed to new terms for my software account. Guess what? AI is now bundled into all of my Microsoft software. Even worse, Microsoft recently raised the price of its subscriptions by $3 per month to cover the additional AI benefits. I get to use my AI companion 60 times per month as part of the deal. But I don’t want to use it. I want to kill it. As you can see, I’ve never used this service. I still have all 60 credits unused. But I’m paying for it—because it’s now embedded into Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. This is how AI gets introduced to the marketplace—by force-feeding the public. And they’re doing this for a very good reason. Most people won’t pay for AI voluntarily—just 8% according to a recent survey. So they need to bundle it with some other essential product. You never get to decide. Before proceeding let me ask a simple question: Has there ever been a major innovation that helped society, but only 8% of the public would pay for it? That’s never happened before in human history. Everybody wanted electricity in their homes. Everybody wanted a radio. Everybody wanted a phone. Everybody wanted a refrigerator. Everybody wanted a TV set. Everybody wanted the Internet. They wanted it. They paid for it. They enjoyed it. AI isn’t like that. People distrust it or even hate it—and more so with each passing month. So the purveyors must bundle it into current offerings, and force usage that way. There’s another reason why huge tech companies do this—but they don’t like to talk about it. If they bundle AI into other products and services, they can hide the losses on their income statement. That wouldn’t be possible if they charged for AI as a standalone product. That would make its profitability (or, more likely, loss) very easy to measure. Shareholders would complain. Stock prices would drop. Companies would be forced to address customer concerns. But if AI is bundled into existing businesses, Silicon Valley CEOs can pretend that AI is a moneymaker, even if the public is lukewarm or hostile. It’s like a restaurant selling granite rocks for dessert. Nobody will buy them or eat them—so the product fails miserably. But if a popular restaurant adds a dollar to the meal price, and gives every customer a rock with their bill—well, then they can say that: Every customer gets rocks for dessert. Every customer pays for it. Their business is more profitable because of the tasty granite rocks. This is how AI accounting works in Silicon Valley. And that’s why Google does something similar to Microsoft. They add AI to search results—you don’t get to choose. It’s force-feeding all over again. So these huge digital platforms can pretend that users have totally embraced the new tech. Shut up, buddy, and chew on your rock. This is how AI gets implemented everywhere. You don’t get to choose. You’re never asked. It just shows up. Now you have to deal with it. I don’t want AI customer service—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI responses to my Google searches—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI integrated into my software—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI sending me emails—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI music on Spotify—but I don’t get a choice. I don’t want AI books on Amazon—but I don’t get a choice. If they gave people a choice, they would reject this tyranny masquerading as innovation. The AI business model would collapse overnight if they needed consumer opt-in. Just pass that law, and see how quickly the bots disappear. Customer surveys prove that. The survey cited above presented customers with descriptions of different refrigerators. When AI was added as a feature, people showed a preference for all the other models. The Wall Street Journal concludes that companies should “beware of promoting AI in products.” And it’s more than just products and services. People don’t even want AI in texts or documents of any sort. In an earlier day, customer feedback would discourage businesses from adding AI. But the dominant AI companies are huge quasi-monopolies. So they don’t ask, they don’t care—they just do it. Every day it gets more brazen. Meta is now planning to unleash bots on you in even more aggressive ways than Google or Microsoft. They are training AI bots to send you messages, whether you want them or not. And I know (from painful personal experience) that you cannot disable Facebook Messenger without shutting down your entire Facebook account. There’s a word for this. It’s called spam—and people hate it. But that’s the blight of the AI revolution. It looks like spam. It smells like spam. It tastes like spam. What happens if we decide to boycott AI? The sad truth is that we can’t. It’s already too powerful. If I wanted to boycott AI, I would need to give up My email account All Google searches My word processing software Also Excel, PowerPoint, etc. Amazon and many other online retailers Spotify and any other music streamer that allows it Contacting customer service at many companies Etc. etc. etc. That’s bad news—because most of us need some of those things to live and work. But it will soon get much worse. Just wait and see. The day will eventually come when… You want to see a doctor or nurse—but you will be forced to use the AI chatbot. You will desperately need counseling, but only AI will be available. You seek legal advice, and just get a bot. You apply for a job, but they give it to a bot instead. You need an emergency responder—police, firefighter, paramedic—but you can only reach a bot. We already know that they won’t let us choose. That’s already decided. So now the only question is how quickly they will remove the few remaining instances where humans deal with humans. Judging by the current situation, tech companies will move quickly. They don’t ask for permission. It just happens. What’s most shocking is that they have done all this before making AI reliable. Every day I hear accounts of stupid and ridiculous things coming from bots. You would think they would fix this mess before forcing AI on us. But here’s the harsh reality. They won’t fix it, because they don’t know how. Despite that, they will accelerate the force-feeding. There should be laws against this. There should be transparency laws. There should be opt-in laws. There should be liability laws. There should be IP laws. We’re lucky that AI bots don’t write the laws—at least not yet. We should take action before that happens. And if politicians won’t act, let’s turn to voter initiatives (which are binding in many places) or class-action suits or take other steps. I have a hunch that juries will be sympathetic to our plight. After all, they are getting force-fed too. Let me address a final question—which is the frequently mentioned argument that the US needs to develop AI as fast as possible to get there before the Chinese. I’m not sure where there is. But I’m happy to let China or other countries arrive at that unhappy destination while I wait behind and watch. I’m absolutely certain that getting there will be a matter of great regret. There might even be the last place you would want to be. So I’d rather it happened as far away from here as possible. Ted, you called it "spam." My term for it is far less polite. I'm off all social media. I refuse to use AI for my writing. When AI "overviews" come up on Google searches, I immediately skip past them to real sources. I opt out as much as one individual can. There are free alternatives to Microsoft Office and they don't have AI. No posts Ready for more?

Title: Nvidia Briefly on Track to Become World's Most Valuable Company Ever
URL: https://www.gadgets360.com/ai/news/nvidia-on-track-worlds-most-valuable-company-ever-8825548
Time Published: 2025-07-04T13:39:29Z
Full Content:
Photo Credit: Reuters Nvidia was co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4 percent to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalization than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5 percent at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalization of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7 percent to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8 percent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 percent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7 percent of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28 percent of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © Thomson Reuters 2025 For the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

The holiday season is make-or-break for many retailers, with Christmas marketing turning up the heat on sales and customer engagement. The National Retail Federation (NRF) reported U.S. holiday (November-December) retail sales reached a record $994.1 billion in 2024, up 4% from 2023. That’s nearly $1 trillion of buying power in just two months. And about 55% of e‑commerce Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is generated in the last two quarters of the year. With consumers ready to spend, it’s essential to have a solid plan in place. Here are 22 proven Christmas marketing ideas, complete with real examples and practical tips to help inspire impactful festive campaigns. Holiday shoppers behave differently from other times of year. Many start early: roughly 28% of consumers begin holiday shopping before Labor Day, and nearly 73% aim to have most gifts purchased by December. In other words, planning for Christmas Marketing should begin well in advance (late summer or early fall) to catch early-bird buyers. Mobile and social channels dominate this season: mobile devices generate 71% of digital traffic and 56% of orders during the holidays, while 89% of consumers say social media influences their holiday shopping. Moreover, festive campaigns also play by different rules than everyday promotions. Shoppers expect holiday-themed storytelling, festive visuals, and limited-time urgency. Campaigns that feel warm, joyful, and generous can cut through the clutter. As Subharun Mukherjee, Head of Marketing at CleverTap, notes in the Guide to Optimizing Massive Online Sales (OMOS) Events e-book: “Global online events are revolutionizing the e‑commerce landscape, with companies reporting their highest sales during the holiday season. During online sales events, customers are inundated with deals, discounts, and exclusive offers, making it even harder for businesses to differentiate themselves from the competition.” Merchants must align their Christmas marketing ideas with today’s realities: digital-first, mobile-optimized, and emotionally resonant campaigns that stand out in a crowded and competitive environment. Christmas marketing requires early, creative planning and strategies tuned to seasonal mindsets. With that in mind, here are 22 top Christmas marketing ideas to boost sales this holiday season: Run a “25 Days of Christmas” sale or advent-style countdown on your site. Feature a different deal or product each day and promote it via email marketing, SMS, and push notification. Daily surprises (e.g., flash discounts or bonus gifts) build excitement and urgency as Christmas approaches. You can use CleverTap for Christmas marketing to schedule automated push or in-app messages for each day’s offer, keeping users engaged with timed alerts. This approach gamifies shopping and drives repeat visits to see what’s next. Create themed gift bundles (e.g., “Holiday Wellness Kit” or “Winter Warmth Bundle”) that group complementary products with a special price. Bundles encourage customers to buy more in one order. Product bundles drive up the average order value (AOV) by encouraging customers to purchase more items in one go. For example, Apple’s holiday strategy includes exclusive bundles with premium services, targeting loyal users with limited-time offers, proving that even simple bundles can feel high-end with the right positioning. Source: KennyLee Creative Make the bundles feel exclusive (limited supply or exclusive items) and wrapped in festive packaging or imagery. For example, group best-selling items together or curate gifts around a theme like “Gifts for Her” or “Gourmet Food Basket.” CleverTap can help here by recommending bundles to customers based on their past purchases or browsing behavior, or by sending targeted emails promoting bundles to those who have shown interest in similar products. Occasionally run surprise flash sales or “lightning deals” on key days during Christmas marketing campaigns. Because these are on a very short deadline (hours or a day), they tap into shoppers’ fear of missing out (FOMO). Limited-time offers with a ticking clock get people to act fast. Promote flash sales aggressively: use site banners, social media posts, and especially SMS or push alerts to ensure customers see the deal immediately. CleverTap can orchestrate these multi-channel blasts, allowing you to reach email, push, and social channels simultaneously and follow up with reminders. Because timing is key, set up countdown timers on pages and send alerts at the sale’s midpoint and final hour. Offer free shipping on holiday orders (possibly with a minimum threshold) and emphasize hassle-free returns. Free shipping is one of the most powerful incentives: around 60% of shoppers will add extra items to their cart just to qualify for free shipping. Prominently advertise “Free Shipping” on banner ads, email subject lines, and product pages. Extend your return window as well, reassuring customers that any gifts that don’t fit can be returned in January at no additional cost. From an operational view, free returns are also important: 45% of consumers rank free return shipping as most important to them. Give your online store a seasonal look. Update homepage banners, product images, and CTAs with a holiday theme (think snowflakes, twinkling lights, or red-and-green color schemes). Change button text to holiday calls-to-action (“Shop Holiday Gifts” instead of “Shop Now”). These visual cues signal to visitors that they’re in a festive shopping environment. A themed site also feels fresh and can boost engagement. (Don’t forget holiday-specific SEO – e.g., update meta titles/descriptions to include keywords like “Christmas sale,” “holiday gifts,” etc.) Give your logo, product images, or packaging a limited-edition holiday twist. Even a slight seasonal makeover can make your brand more shareable on social. Iconic examples prove the power of this: Starbucks’ annual red holiday cup (introduced in 1997) became a cultural touchpoint signaling the start of the holiday season. Source: Forbes Similarly, Hershey’s Kisses added red-and-green foil wrappers and holiday ads, cementing their image as a holiday staple. Source: Herseyland You can do the same at your scale. Add Santa hats to your logo, wrap products in festive-themed boxes, or create holiday gift tags. When packaging looks gift-ready, customers are more likely to share photos on social media, amplifying your reach. Pick an overarching theme or narrative for your Christmas marketing. For example, run a “12 Days of Gifting” campaign, a Santa’s workshop theme, or a winter wonderland story. This theme should tie together your emails, social posts, ads, and on-site banners. For example, WestJet Airlines created a heartwarming “Christmas Miracle” narrative. They set up a video Santa to ask passengers what they wanted, then secretly bought everyone’s wishes and delivered the gifts on the baggage carousel. The whole event was filmed as a story and went massively viral (27+ million YouTube views in one week). Source: WestJet Christmas Miracle: Real-time Giving Story-driven campaigns make messaging cohesive and memorable. Each email or social post can continue the story (Day 1: “Santa’s stocking stuffers – 20% off!”; Day 2: “Elves’ favorite toys – buy one, get one”). A consistent theme reinforces your brand’s holiday voice. Craft a special holiday email series tailored to customer segments. Send promotional emails based on behavior: for instance, if a customer looked at winter coats, email them a curated gift guide of related items. If another customer was a frequent buyer last holiday, give them a VIP early access deal. Personalize subject lines (“[Name], unwrap your 20% off gift inside!”) and content by recipient. Segment your lists (e.g., “Frequent buyers”, “Browsers of category X”) and send each a custom holiday message. For example, you could send “Gifts for Tech Lovers” to gadget-seekers and “Gifts Under $50” to budget shoppers. For example, Travelodge’s festive email invited users to “Make a Wish This Christmas” for a chance to win a 2025 trip, combining seasonal visuals, interactive elements, and segmented travel suggestions by season. A smart blend of personalization and engagement to drive early bookings. Source: ReallyGoodEmails CleverTap’s email automation and segmentation make this easy: it can pull user attributes like past purchases or interest tags to populate email content and ensure each shopper sees relevant product suggestions. Leverage user-generated content with holiday-themed social media contests. For instance, challenge followers to share a photo of themselves with your product in a festive setting, using a branded holiday hashtag (e.g., #MyBrandGift). Or run a “12 Days of Christmas Wish List” challenge: each day, invite customers to comment with their holiday wishlist item from your store for a chance to win it. These interactive posts boost engagement and spread brand visibility. Encourage participants by offering small prizes (like a coupon code or free gift) for the best or most creative entry. Remember to repost the best entries on your own channels; it increases reach and adds authenticity. For example, Starbucks launched a #RedCupContest on Instagram where customers were invited to post creative photos of the seasonal red cup. One year, Starbucks received over 24,000 entries in just 5 days during the contest. Source: People Magazine Build fun, interactive web pages or microsites to engage visitors. Ideas include a “spin-the-wheel” discount game, a festive quiz (“Which Holiday Gift Suits You?”), or a digital advent calendar that reveals a coupon or product each day. Gamification can significantly boost engagement and conversions. In fact, research has found that 60% of consumers are more likely to purchase from a brand that includes a gamified experience, and conversion rates can jump up to 7X higher with game-like widgets. For example, a spin-to-win pop-up (“Spin Santa’s Wheel for Your Discount!”) rewards users with a random discount or freebie in exchange for an email signup. These interactive elements make shopping fun and encourage visitors to stay on your site longer. Sephora introduced a holiday “Gift Finder” quiz on its site. Visitors answer questions about the gift recipient and budget, and the quiz suggests products. They promoted the feature via Instagram and saw huge success. Source: Sephora Indonesia Capitalize on the popularity of short-form video. Create holiday-themed video content for ads and social reels (Instagram Reels, TikTok, YouTube Shorts). This could be a heartwarming story featuring your product as a gift, a quick demo of a holiday deal, or even a lighthearted Christmas jingle. Vertical videos with cheerful holiday music get high engagement on social feeds. For example, a restaurant might film quick clips of festive table settings and specials, or a clothing brand could showcase “Outfit ideas for Christmas parties” in a fast montage. Keep videos short (15–30 seconds) with a clear call to action (e.g., “Shop Now” or “Learn More”). Pair them with holiday hashtags and target them carefully using demographics/interests. Coca-Cola is a great example. Their 2024 “Share the Magic” holiday campaign had TikTok and Instagram influencers sharing personal holiday moments featuring Coca-Cola. They incorporated Coca-Cola’s iconic holiday assets (the vintage Santa, the red trucks) in these bite-sized videos to tap into nostalgia while reaching younger viewers on Reels. Source: Social Storis Publish curated gift guides targeted by shopper persona or recipient. For example: “Gifts for Him,” “Gifts for Kids,” “Gifts Under $25,” “Tech Lover’s Holiday Picks,” etc. Place these guides on your site or as separate landing pages, and link to them in your ads and emails. CleverTap can help personalize this even further. For instance, when a user in-app or on-site browses a category (say, beauty products), you could dynamically show the “Gifts for Her” guide as a suggested page. Gift guides not only simplify shopping, but they also give more exposure to your products. Send customers to the appropriate guide via segmented emails: e.g., email your fashion-loyal customers with “Holiday Style Gift Guide” and your gadget fans with “Best Tech Gifts.” This targeted approach can significantly increase conversions, since shoppers find gifts relevant to their needs. Wishlists make holiday shopping fun and viral: customers can build a list of items they want and easily send it to family and friends. Ensure your site or app supports sharing (via email, social media, or direct link) and display a “Most Wished For” carousel on your homepage. When someone shares a wishlist, you gain new potential customers (friends/family). Wishlists also give you valuable data about what people want. If a user adds an item to a wishlist, you could later send a reminder (“Hey, [Name], items on your wishlist are going fast – get 10% off them today!”). Following up with customers about items on their wishlist – especially if stock is low or a sale is ending – significantly boosts conversions. Amazon popularized this with its shareable Wish Lists. For the holidays, they even introduced a dedicated “Holiday Gift List” feature so families can aggregate gift ideas in one place and share the link around. Source: Amazon Reward and motivate customers who shop early. Offer an “early bird” discount or bonus gift for purchases made in October or early November. For example, a “Halloween to Black Friday” sale pass, or a limited-time code “EARLYXMAS” for 15% off purchases made by November 15. This not only drives early sales (helping you plan inventory and revenue) but also prevents waiting shoppers from drifting to competitors later. For Christmas marketing, CleverTap can identify customers who have previously purchased and automatically target them with these exclusive pre-holiday deals via push or email. Remind all subscribers with email campaigns highlighting inventory or shipping deadlines. Send customers a heartfelt holiday greeting (digital or even printed mailer) with a personalized touch and a coupon. A simple “Happy Holidays, and thank you for shopping with us” message can go a long way. Beyond just text, consider adding a small gift, such as a unique promo code or coupon, inside the card. This makes customers feel valued as individuals, not just revenue sources. With CleverTap’s Promos, you an make this happen easily. Handwritten notes or limited-edition printed postcards (sent to top customers) can also create a memorable “wow” moment during Christmas marketing campaigns. Either way, the aim is to strengthen loyalty by making customers feel appreciated during the season. Chewy, the pet supplies retailer, is renowned for sending actual handwritten holiday cards to its customers. They employ a whole team of card-writers to pen personal notes thanking customers (often including something personal like the pet’s name). Source: X.com Use CleverTap’s automation to trigger thank-you notes at scale: for instance, after a November purchase, you could send a “Thank You for Your Support – Enjoy 10% Off Next Order!” holiday email. Another Christmas marketing idea is to leverage the holiday goodwill by launching a seasonal referral bonus. Reward customers who refer friends and family with holiday-themed incentives. For example, “Give $10, Get $10” gift cards or double reward points if a new customer buys a gift. Make it a win-win: the referrer gets a reward, and the friend also enjoys a welcome discount. Promote the referral offer in your emails, app, and on receipts (“Refer a friend this holiday and you’ll both get $10 off!”). During Christmas, people love recommending gifts. You’re just amplifying word-of-mouth in a measurable way. Run a Christmas-themed giveaway to boost engagement and follower counts. For example, host a social media contest: “Win a $100 Gift Box from us” by liking, sharing, or tagging friends. Alternatively, a photo contest like “Most Festive Decorated Tree” or “Coziest Winter Workspace” featuring your products. Contests create buzz, user-generated content, and excitement around your brand. Make sure the prize is something attractive (perhaps one of your bundles or gift cards). Collect entries and emails (with permission) so you can notify winners. Featuring user photos as part of the contest also builds social proof. Team up with influencers or bloggers for holiday gift roundups. Identify micro-influencers in your niche (e.g., parenting, tech, beauty) and send them a curated holiday gift set. Have them unbox or review the products on social media or YouTube, ideally in a Christmas-themed video (e.g., “Top 5 Holiday Gifts I’m Giving” featuring your products). Alo Yoga did a special holiday collaboration: they released a limited Advent Calendar box of goodies and sent it to wellness influencers, who then unboxed one item each day on TikTok and Instagram. Those influencer videos not only reviewed the products but also built excitement day by day. Source: Alo Yoga Influencers’ authentic recommendations can reach highly targeted audiences. Provide them with a unique discount code to share, creating urgency for their followers. Partner with another brand or artist for a co-branded holiday product or bundle. For example, a fashion retailer might team up with a local accessory designer to create a limited-edition holiday ornament or scarf. Such collaborations generate press and social media interest. Promote the special product jointly in both partners’ marketing channels and offer it as a gift idea. Even a small co-branding (e.g., a custom gift card design with a local artist) can add novelty. CleverTap can assist by creating segments of customers who like either brand and sending them announcements about the new launch, maximizing reach across both customer bases. “Give back” campaigns resonate deeply at Christmas. For instance, run a “buy one, donate one” promotion (e.g., for every product sold, you donate the same item to charity) or pledge a percentage of holiday revenue to a cause. Customers feel good about purchasing when they know it helps someone else. Promote this heavily: add a banner like “This Holiday, Every Purchase Helps [Cause]” on your site. A great campaign idea is to let customers choose between several charities at checkout and match their choice. Not only does this increase goodwill, but it also encourages buyers who prioritize ethical brands. The more visible the campaign (social posts, emails, site banners), the more it amplifies both the impact and your brand’s feel-good story. For example, Lego’s annual #BuildToGive campaign asks fans to build a Lego ornament and share it; for each one posted, Lego donates a set to a child in need. Source: Lego Incorporate local or community elements into your holiday marketing. For example, you could highlight artwork from local artists on your holiday cards or use photos of your local team prepping for Christmas (if appropriate). Feature stories about how your business is celebrating with the community. By foregrounding a local angle (e.g., “Made in [Your City] with love” or “Local artisans in our holiday market”), you tap into that trend. Host a local pop-up event or collaborate with a neighborhood charity, and share it on social. These efforts humanize your brand and can foster loyalty from customers who value community impact. Use clever follow-ups to turn one-time buyers into repeat customers. For everyone who purchased during the Christmas season, send a thank-you email or in-app note in early January. Include a New Year coupon or free shipping code to entice another purchase. Showing appreciation after the fact builds loyalty. A simple “Thank you for your support – enjoy 15% off your next order” goes a long way. Schedule these as automated flows in CleverTap so that every holiday buyer enters a post-purchase sequence. You can also use behavioral triggers, such as offering early access to your January sales to customers who have made multiple holiday purchases. This recency-based outreach keeps your brand top-of-mind and can turn satisfied holiday shoppers into regulars. CleverTap provides the personalization and automation backbone to scale these ideas. Its platform unifies customer data and engagement across push, in-app, email, SMS, and more. For example, CleverTap can create user segments (by location, purchase history, or holiday affinity) and automate tailored campaigns: sending a “12 Days of Deals” push series to one group, while emailing “Gifts for Her” guides to another. Features like behavioral triggers and real-time analytics enable you to instantly remarket to a wishlist user, trigger a cart abandonment email, or send a holiday thank-you flow with minimal manual effort. Many brands use CleverTap to send millions of holiday notifications at peak times, ensuring personalized offers reach the right customers. CleverTap helps you plan, personalize, and perfect your Christmas campaigns. It handles large holiday traffic with built-in scalability, and its reporting lets you see which strategies are driving sales and where to tweak.

Title: Nvidia on track to become world's most valuable company
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/0704/1521822-nvidia-on-track-to-become-worlds-most-valuable-company/
Time Published: 2025-07-04T09:08:55Z
Full Content:
Nvidia hit a market value of $3.92 trillion yesterday, briefly putting it on track to become the most valuable company in history, as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips rose as much as 2.4% to $160.98 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. The shares were last up 1.5% at $159.60, leaving Nvidia's stock market value at $3.89 trillion, just short of Apple's record. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.7% to $499.56. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021 to now near $4 trillion. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the UK. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. The sharp increases in the shares of Nvidia and other Wall Street heavyweights have left people who save for their retirements through widely used S&P 500 index funds heavily exposed to the future of AI technology. Nvidia now accounts for 7% of the S&P 500. Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet together make up 28% of the index. "I strongly believe that AI is a greatly productive tool, but I am fairly sure that the current delivery of AI via large language models and large reasoning models are unlikely to live up to the hype," cautioned Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Title: Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia lead Wall Street’s AI revolution

Nvidia touched a market value of $3.92 trillion on Thursday, briefly overtaking Apple's record valuation. Its stock climbed as high as $160.98 in early trade before settling at $159.60, placing its valuation at $3.89 trillion—just short of Apple’s all-time high of $3.915 trillion from December 2024.(Source: Reuters) Investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence continues to surge, with Nvidia at the center of this wave. Its high-end chips are now essential for training advanced AI models, making the company a prime beneficiary of the current AI investment cycle. Tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Alphabet, and Tesla are racing to build out AI data centers. This has created unprecedented demand for Nvidia’s processors. Microsoft’s market cap stands at $3.7 trillion, while Apple, now in third place, is valued at $3.19 trillion. Nvidia’s transformation has been dramatic. From a valuation of $500 billion in 2021, the company’s worth has soared nearly eight-fold, nearing the $4 trillion mark. It’s now more valuable than the entire Canadian and Mexican stock markets combined and surpasses the market cap of all UK-listed companies. Despite the explosive stock gains, Nvidia trades at about 32 times expected earnings for the next 12 months. That’s actually below its five-year average of 41, signaling that earnings estimates are rising even faster than its share price. Nvidia’s shares have rebounded over 68% since their April low, which followed market fears around President Trump’s global tariff plans. Optimism around potential trade deals has helped ease concerns, reigniting investor confidence. As Nvidia becomes increasingly dominant, its influence is spreading across the broader market. The company now makes up 7% of the S&P 500. Together with Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Alphabet, these tech giants comprise 28% of the entire index, impacting millions of retirement portfolios. Despite the enthusiasm, some experts urge caution. Kim Forrest of Bokeh Capital Partners warns that while AI is a powerful productivity tool, the current models—especially large language and reasoning models—may fall short of expectations. Founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Nvidia started as a niche GPU company for video games. Today, it has become Wall Street’s go-to indicator for the AI sector, even replacing Intel in the Dow Jones index in a landmark shift for the semiconductor industry. While Nvidia’s future looks bright, challenges remain. In January, a Chinese AI startup, DeepSeek, shook markets with a cheaper model that outperformed Western rivals. If such trends continue, spending on high-end processors could come under pressure. However, Nvidia’s momentum and strategic positioning still keep it ahead of the curve.

Δ The artificial intelligence chip designer’s market capitalization rose as high as $3.92 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s record closing value of $3.915 trillion on Dec. 26, 2024, Reuters reported Thursday. Nvidia’s market cap dipped to $3.89 trillion later Thursday, according to the report. The company still has the largest market value at this time, with Microsoft ranked second at $3.7 trillion and Apple third at $3.19 trillion, the report said. The report attributed Nvidia’s surge to Wall Street’s continued optimism about AI; tech giants’ demand for the company’s products, which they need to build their AI data centers; and Nvidia’s relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation. Nvidia’s market cap has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, according to the report. The firm’s stock has rebounded from its recently closing low on April 4, which was attributed to the announcements of new tariffs in the United States that were made at that time, per the report. When Nvidia’s market cap hit what was then its all-time high on June 25, Bloomberg reported that the company faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China but also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building AI infrastructure. During a May 28 earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said new U.S. export controls have effectively “closed” the $50 billion Chinese market to American companies. Despite that setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. The company is doing so because demand for AI inference — the AI workloads in which new data is applied to trained models to generate outputs — is soaring. Other areas of growth include enterprise and industrial AI, and Nvidia has solutions for both, Huang said during the call. When Apple’s market capitalization surged in late December, analysts attributed the rise to the company’s involvement with AI and an expectation that the technology would lead to a wave of consumers deciding to upgrade their phones at once.

Title: Accenture warns AI’s carbon emissions could surge 11-fold. But Big Tech’s still racing to build—and not slow down for sustainability

Time Published: 2025-07-03T17:28:23Z
Full Content:
Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition...Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence…Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance…Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up…Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. As an early-summer heat wave blanketed my home state of New Jersey last week, it felt like perfect timing to stumble across a sobering new prediction from Accenture: AI data centers’ carbon emissions are on track to surge 11-fold by 2030. The report estimates that over the next five years, AI data centers could consume 612 terawatt-hours of electricity—roughly equivalent to Canada’s total annual power consumption—driving a 3.4% increase in global carbon emissions. And the strain doesn’t stop at the power grid. At a time when freshwater resources are already under severe pressure, AI data centers are also projected to consume more than 3 billion cubic meters of water per year—a volume that surpasses the annual freshwater withdrawals of entire countries like Norway or Sweden. Unsurprisingly, the report—Powering Sustainable AI—offers recommendations for how to rein in the problem and prevent those numbers from becoming reality. But with near-daily headlines about Big Tech’s massive AI data center buildouts across the U.S. and worldwide, I can’t help but feel cynical. The urgent framing of an AI race against China doesn’t seem to leave much room—or time—for serious thinking about sustainability. Just yesterday, for example, OpenAI agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. The additional capacity from Oracle totals about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the U.S., according to Bloomberg reporting. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses. And this week, Meta was reported to be seeking to raise $29 billion from private capital firms to build AI data centers in the U.S., while already building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana. As part of that deal, the local utility, Entergy, will supply three new power plants. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made his intentions clear: The U.S. must rapidly expand AI data center construction or risk falling behind China in the race for AI dominance. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast in May, he warned that America’s edge in artificial intelligence could erode unless it keeps pace with China’s aggressive build-out of data center capacity and factory-scale hardware. “The U.S. really needs to focus on streamlining the ability to build data centers and produce energy,” Zuckerberg said. “Otherwise, we’ll be at a significant disadvantage.” The U.S. government seems to be aligned with that sense of urgency. David Sacks, now serving as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, has also underscored that energy and data center expansion are central to America’s AI strategy—leaving little room for sustainability concerns. On his All In podcast in February, Sacks argued that Washington’s “go-slow” approach to AI could strangle the industry. He emphasized that the U.S. needs to clear the way for infrastructure and energy development—including AI data centers—to keep pace with China. In late May, he went further, saying that streamlining permitting and expanding power generation are essential for AI’s future—something he claimed has been “effectively impossible under the Biden administration.” His message: the U.S. needs to race to build faster. Accenture, meanwhile, is urging its clients to responsibly grow and engineer its AI data centers in a bid to balance growth with environmental responsibility. It is offering a new metric, that it calls the Sustainable AI Quotient (SAIQ), to measure the true costs of AI in terms of money invested, megawatt-hours of energy consumed, tons of CO₂ emitted and cubic meters of water used. The firm’s report says the metric will help organizations answer a basic question: “What are we actually getting from the resources we’re investing in AI?” and allow that enterprise to measure its performance across time. I spoke to Matthew Robinson, managing director of Accenture Research and co-author of the report, who emphasized that he hoped Accenture’s sobering predictions would be proven wrong. “They kind of take your breath away,” he said, explaining that Accenture modeled future energy consumption from the expected number of installed AI chips adjusted for utilization and the additional energy requirements of data centers. That data was combined with regional data on electricity generation, energy mix and emissions, while water use was assessed based on AI data center energy consumption and how much water is consumed per unit of electricity generated. “The point really is to open the conversation around the actions that are available to avert this pathway—we don’t want to be right here,” he said. He would not comment on the actions of specific companies like OpenAI or Meta, but said that overall, clearly more effort is needed to avert the rise in carbonisation fueled by AI data centers while still allowing for growth. Accenture’s recommendations certainly make sense: Optimize the power efficiency of AI workloads and data centers with everything from low-carbon energy options to cooling innovations. Use AI thoughtfully, by choosing smaller AI models, and better pricing models for incentivizing efficiency. And ensure better governance over AI sustainability initiatives. It’s hard to imagine that the biggest players in the race for AI dominance—Big Tech giants and heavily funded startups—will hit the brakes long enough to seriously address these growing concerns. Not that it’s impossible. Take Google, for example: In its latest sustainability report released this week, the company revealed that its data centers are consuming more power than ever. In 2024, Google used approximately 32.1 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, with a staggering 95.8%—about 30.8 million MWh—consumed by its data centers. That’s more than double the energy its data centers used in 2020, just before the consumer AI boom. Still, Google emphasized that it’s making meaningful strides toward cleaning up its energy supply, even as demand surges. The company said it cut its data center energy emissions by 12% in 2024, thanks to clean energy projects and efficiency upgrades. And it’s squeezing more out of every watt. Google reported that the amount of compute per unit of electricity has increased about six-fold over the past five years. Its power usage effectiveness (PUE)—a key measure of data center efficiency—is now approaching the theoretical minimum of 1.0, with a reported PUE of 1.09 in 2024. “Just speaking personally, I’d be optimistic,” said Robinson. Note: Check out this new Fortune video about my tour of IBM’s quantum computing test lab. I had a fabulous time hanging out at IBM’s Yorktown Heights campus (a midcentury modern marvel designed by the same guy as the St. Louis Arch and the classic TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport) in New York. The video was part of my coverage for this year’s Fortune 500 issue that included an article that dug deep into IBM’s recent rebound. As I said in my piece, “walking through the IBM research center is like stepping into two worlds at once. There are the steel and glass curves of Saarinen’s design, punctuated by massive walls made of stones collected from the surrounding fields, with original Eames chairs dotting discussion nooks. But this 20th-century modernism contrasts starkly with the sleek, massive, refrigerator-like quantum computer—among the most advanced in the world—that anchors the collaboration area and working lab, where it whooshes with the steady hum of its cooling system.” With that, here’s the rest of the AI news. Sharon Goldmansharon.goldman@fortune.com@sharongoldman Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence, after Daniel Gross steps down to join Meta. Ilya Sutskever, the former OpenAI chief scientist who founded Safe Superintelligence (SSI) with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy a year ago, confirmed that he will now serve as SSI’s CEO after Daniel Gross stepped down. Sustkever posted on X saying: “Daniel Gross’s time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next endeavor. I am now formally CEO of SSI, and Daniel Levy is President. The technical team continues to report to me. ⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through.” Meta was rumored to have sought to acquire the $32 billion-valued SSI. Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese artificial intelligence companies are gaining ground globally, challenging U.S. supremacy and intensifying a potential AI arms race. Across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, organizations—from multinational banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered to Saudi Aramco—are increasingly adopting large language models from Chinese firms such as DeepSeek and Alibaba as alternatives to U.S. offerings like ChatGPT. Even American cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google now offer access to DeepSeek’s models, despite U.S. government security restrictions on the company’s apps. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT still leads in global adoption—with 910 million downloads versus DeepSeek’s 125 million—Chinese models are undercutting U.S. competition by offering nearly comparable performance at much lower prices. Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up. As Mark Zuckerberg rapidly staffs up Meta’s new superintelligence lab, his company has reportedly offered some OpenAI researchers eye-popping pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in first-year compensation, Wired reports. The offers, which include immediate stock vesting, have been extended to at least 10 OpenAI employees, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. While Meta’s aggressive recruiting tactics have caught the attention of top talent, some OpenAI staffers told Wired they’re weighing the massive payouts against their potential impact at Meta versus staying at OpenAI. A Meta spokesperson pushed back, claiming reports of the offer sizes are exaggerated. Still, even Meta’s senior engineers typically make around $850,000 per year, with those in higher pay bands earning over $1.5 million annually, according to Levels.FYI data. Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. Microsoft’s sales chief, Judson Althoff, is reshaping the company’s sales organization to double down on AI, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. Althoff’s Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) unit will now focus on embedding Copilot across devices and roles, deepening Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 adoption, winning high-impact AI deals, expanding Azure cloud migration, and strengthening cybersecurity to support AI growth. The memo, sent just one day before Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs—many of which affected Althoff’s sales teams—outlined his vision to make Microsoft “the Frontier AI Firm.” According to Business Insider, this restructuring follows Althoff’s earlier plan to cut the number of sales solution areas in half starting this fiscal year.

That’s how much U.S. investment in AI companies soared to in the first quarter of this year—a 33% jump from the previous quarter and a staggering 550% increase compared to the quarter before ChatGPT’s 2022 debut, according to PitchBook. The biggest price tag? Data centers. The New York Times reports that Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google plan to spend a combined $320 billion on infrastructure this year—more than double what they spent just two years ago. A huge chunk of that will go toward building new data centers to keep up with the exploding demand for AI. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Nvidia was on track to become the most valuable company in history today, with the chipmaker's market capitalisation reaching $3.92 trillion as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2% at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fueling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5% to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8%, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68% from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US.stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4% on the benchmark S&P 500. AI poster child Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Apple’s Big AI Bet: Could Perplexity Be A Game Changer?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/07/03/apples-big-ai-bet-could-perplexity-be-a-game-changer/
Time Published: 2025-07-03T11:59:17Z
Full Content:
ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Apple and Artificial Intelligence Apple’s stock is down nearly 20% so far in 2025, making it the only Magnificent Seven member in the red. Acquiring Perplexity AI, a leading AI search engine, could immediately boost investor confidence and give Apple a chance to seize AI leadership. The stakes are clear: On June 28, 2025, Bloomberg revealed that Apple's M&A chief, Adrian Perica, had discussed acquiring Perplexity with services head Eddy Cue. Analysts estimate such a deal could cost between $25 and $30 billion, roughly twice Perplexity's last funding round valuation, and consistent with recent acquisition premiums paid for strategic AI properties. Days later, reports emerged that Apple is also weighing partnerships with Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT to power a new Siri. Apple is racing to close its AI gap through whatever means necessary. Industry experts and Wall Street analysts believe a Perplexity deal could recast Apple as an AI orchestration leader, extend its high-margin services through renewed hardware demand, and potentially trigger a valuation rerating. Disclaimer: This article is based solely on publicly available information, market reports, and the author's independent research and analysis. The author has no insider contacts at Apple, Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, or any other company mentioned, and no direct knowledge of their internal strategies, acquisition decisions, or future plans. All strategic interpretations are speculative and intended for informational purposes only. Apple is reportedly considering acquiring Perplexity AI not just to buy another chatbot, but to build what could become the world’s first consumer AI orchestration platform. Instead of forcing users to choose between ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Search, its system would automatically call upon the best model for each task. This embodies Apple's 'it just works' philosophy, delivering seamless, intelligent experiences that are intuitive, invisible, and effortlessly powerful. This isn’t just about catching up in AI. It’s about redefining how humans interact with it. Using intent recognition (understanding what the user wants—like checking the weather vs drafting an email) and query analysis (figuring out the best way to answer—like searching real-time data vs explaining a concept), the system routes requests in milliseconds. Here's how it could work: For example, ask, 'Should I invest in Apple stock?' Perplexity pulls the latest market data and analyst commentary, with citations. ChatGPT explains investing principles and risk factors in conversational language. Apple Intelligence then combines everything into one smart, personalized response. Whether you're asking Siri a question, pointing your camera at a landmark, or drafting an email, each AI model contributes its unique strength, fused into one unified experience. Daily examples of this ambient intelligence include: "What's the weather?" → Apple Intelligence delivers local results on-device; "Cancel my meeting politely." → ChatGPT drafts the diplomatic email; "Any new research on quantum computing?" → Perplexity surfaces the latest studies; "Set a timer for 10 minutes." → Apple Intelligence handles it privately, on-device. Personal data remains protected on-device, with only anonymized queries sent to external services when necessary. Users retain override control, but most interactions become ambient and invisible. If Apple pursues an orchestration strategy, it would likely rely on each AI partner playing a specialized role. ChatGPT excels at conversation, Claude at reasoning, and Perplexity at real-time, citation-backed search. Unlike general LLMs, Perplexity is an AI-native search engine specialized for real-time, citation-backed answers atop these models. Think of Perplexity as Google Search reimagined for the AI era. Instead of giving you a list of blue links to sift through, it delivers direct, citation-backed answers in clear, conversational language, summarizing multiple sources so you can decide intelligently what to explore further. It also provides cues on related topics worth investigating. For example, when you ask “Should I buy Coinbase stock?”, Perplexity doesn’t just list articles. It offers a structured, conversational analysis including current price, valuation ratios, Morningstar fair value, fundamental risks, technical ratings, and professional opinions—all in one place—followed by suggested related questions like options strategies, historical comparisons, and upcoming catalysts. The acquisition logic becomes clear when comparing alternatives. ChatGPT's $300 billion valuation makes acquisition prohibitive, while partnerships suffice for conversational needs. Claude, valued at $61.5 billion, could cost $80–90 billion with market premiums, unjustifiable when licensing suffices. At a $14 billion last funding round valuation, Perplexity is the attainable target, with specialized search capabilities and an orchestration-ready architecture that appears well-suited to Apple’s potential orchestration approach. Apple and Perplexity Currently, Perplexity generates just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), doubling from ~$50 million in late 2024—a fraction of its potential under Apple’s vast distribution and financial moat. With more than 2.2 billion active devices, a premium user base, and seamless payment infrastructure, its revenue baseline could expand dramatically. Even at a 30% conversion rate among more than 2.2 billion devices, priced at $15 to $20 per month, consumer revenue alone could reach $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually. Enterprise markets offer additional upside, as AI tools command premium pricing: Microsoft Copilot starts at $30 per user monthly, Lexis+ runs around $300–400 per attorney per month, Westlaw starts near $133 and rises for advanced tiers, and Bloomberg Law costs roughly $6,000 per lawyer annually. Law firms spend up to $21,000 per attorney on specialized research tools, while major universities allocate up to $12.5 million annually to digital resources. Pre-installed across Apple’s ecosystem, Perplexity would gain instant reach unmatched by competitors, transforming it from a standalone service into a defensible, multibillion-dollar AI search powerhouse. Combined consumer and enterprise potential creates a clear path to recovering the estimated $30 billion acquisition cost within a decade or sooner, and could catapult Apple onto offense rather than leaving it on the defensive. Apple's current partnership with ChatGPT illustrates the limitations of relying on external AI providers. Each query requires user permission, incurs per-request costs, and faces security restrictions and delays due to routing through external providers. More importantly, these models cannot fully leverage Apple's Neural Engine architecture to deliver optimal performance. The Microsoft–OpenAI relationship offers a cautionary parallel. Despite Microsoft’s $13 billion investment, strategic tensions have emerged as it now competes directly with OpenAI in search, coding, and enterprise AI services. OpenAI has even considered filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft, and ongoing governance disputes continue to hinder both companies' strategic goals. Acquiring Perplexity AI could avoid these partnership pitfalls while delivering four key advantages. Seamless integration could eliminate permission prompts for factual queries, remove external API dependencies, and reduce latency through direct local processing. Hardware optimization could allow Perplexity's search models to run natively on Apple's M4 Neural Engine, minimizing network delays while maintaining privacy through unified memory architecture. The deal could also provide immediate talent acquisition—Apple would instantly gain proven AI experts who've already built a successful search-AI hybrid at scale. This specialized expertise could become crucial as Siri improvements remain delayed until at least 2026. Moreover, top talent attracts top talent: having Perplexity's team in-house could significantly enhance Apple's ability to recruit other leading AI researchers. Finally, cost efficiency could emerge from owning the highest-volume use case—factual queries—allowing Apple to avoid per-API-call expenses while continuing to license specialized conversational models only where necessary. This orchestration approach creates multiple competitive advantages: For users: No more wondering which AI tool to download or try, or AI app hopping. Just ask and get the best answer from whichever AI knows best. For Apple: It could deliver the unified experiences users expect from Apple and create true platform differentiation. While Android users juggle separate apps, iPhone users could get everything integrated intelligently. For competitors: In the face of Apple’s seamless AI orchestration, their offerings may quickly feel outdated and like disjointed point solutions. Microsoft’s Copilot could seem bolted-on, Google’s AI Overviews might remain limited to a single Gemini-driven perspective, and Meta could continue focusing mainly on social features. Just as the iPhone transformed how we used phones, Apple’s orchestration could transform how we use AI. On the other hand, if rivals like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon were to acquire Perplexity instead, they could embed it deeply at the OS level, leaving Apple to continue developing such solutions in-house, where it has seen only limited success so far. Acquiring Perplexity could put Apple on a fast track to deliver the premium “wow” experiences it is known for, securing advantages that could be extremely costly for competitors to counter. Samsung's reported partnership discussions with Perplexity this year add immediate pressure. Preferential Android access could not only weaken Apple's differentiation but also drive Perplexity's acquisition cost even higher. While Apple is late to AI, monetization remains largely unproven across the industry, giving it a rare chance to leapfrog competitors by executing orchestration better than anyone else. The challenges are significant. Bringing together multiple AI systems at Apple's scale will be an enormous engineering lift. Orchestrating requests in milliseconds without glitches demands flawless backend architecture. Apple's brand is built on privacy: even anonymized external queries could trigger user concerns if transparency isn't crystal clear. With Siri upgrades delayed to 2026, a 12 to 18-month Perplexity integration risks missing the AI wave entirely if rivals move faster. The estimated $30 billion price tag could rise further if other bidders enter the fray. These risks are real, but with AI becoming the next battleground, Apple may have no choice but to tackle them head-on if it wants to become a leader. The stakes are high. This move could trigger a valuation rerating and preserve Apple’s leadership in the next tech battleground. However, delay or indecision risks ceding ground to rivals and forfeiting a valuable strategic edge. This orchestration bet could redefine human-AI interaction, but only if Apple acts decisively before the window closes.

ByJohn Kang ByJohn Kang, Forbes Staff. Shina Chung and Sam Altman are hoping for a win-win. Striding purposefully across the stage at a packed media briefing held in Seoul in early February, Shina Chung, CEO of Korean internet giant Kakao, leaned in to greet OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman. After six months of negotiations, the two companies had just sealed a partnership that would give Kakao (market cap: $20 billion) access to the American AI titan’s powerful technology. As Chung declared on stage, it could potentially turn “all imaginable AI-era services into reality”—and give Kakao a fighting chance to leapfrog the competition. With OpenAI’s help, Kakao hopes to realize its ambitions of being at the forefront of providing hyper-personalized services to the 49 million users of its ubiquitous superapp KakaoTalk, which equals about 94% of the country’s population. Chung is targeting a November rollout of so-called AI agents—next generation virtual assistants that can go beyond answering basic questions to making decisions and even taking actions on behalf of users. Shina Chung, CEO of Kakao “We needed a partner we could trust, especially one who leads the field in performance and innovation,” says Chung in an exclusive interview with Forbes Asia at Kakao’s office in Pangyo, South Korea’s Silicon Valley, just south of Seoul. “We had the same philosophy.” For Kakao and its first woman CEO, the OpenAI alliance could be nothing less than a game-changer. Since taking the top job in March 2024, Chung’s biggest challenge is to steer the company through the longest stretch of sluggish sales in its 15-year history. The 50-year-old Chung, who featured on Forbes Asia’s Power Businesswomen list last year, is betting that going all-in on AI will be a catalyst for growth. “We are now preparing to significantly change KakaoTalk so that AI can penetrate its many services,” she says. The collaboration isn’t a one-way deal. For OpenAI, it offers an opportunity to further its global ambitions by providing access to one of the world’s most tech-savvy markets, which has the highest number of paying subscribers outside the U.S. for ChatGPT, its revolutionary chatbot. “We’re excited to bring advanced AI to Kakao’s millions of users and work together to integrate our technology into services that transform how Kakao’s users communicate and connect,” says OpenAI’s chief product officer Kevin Weil by email. Just the day before the glad-handing event with Chung, Altman was in Tokyo with SoftBank’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, announcing a new joint venture to market AI services to Japanese companies. SoftBank recently led a $40 billion funding round in OpenAI and the two companies are also partners in the $500 billion Stargate project to build AI data centers in the U.S. Jaehyun Kim For Forbes ASIA It’s a critical turning point for Kakao. The company’s business is dependent on the Korean market—compared with blue-chip stalwarts like Samsung and Hyundai whose fortunes are determined by global exports—which faces a deepening economic slump. The country’s GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter amid the threat of a global trade war, weak consumer spending and months of political turmoil. In 2024 the company narrowed its net loss to 161.9 billion won ($119.4 million) from 1.82 trillion won the previous year, on a 4% uptick in revenue to 7.87 trillion won. The alliance with OpenAI could yield as much as double-digit sales growth within two years, according to Kakao as it transforms itself into a company where AI is at the core of its operations and services. Percentages have been rounded. Chung will need to act fast to hard-bake the fast-evolving tech into Kakao’s businesses, which run the gamut of everyday activities, from messaging and online banking to music streaming and taxi-hailing, to gain an edge on its chief rival Naver, South Korea’s biggest internet company by revenue (2024: 10.73 trillion won). The Seongnam-based firm is widely seen as being a step ahead of Kakao in the AI race with its large language model (LLM) HyperClova X, launched in 2023 and tailored for the Korean language and culture. Also closing in is a fast-growing crop of local AI native startups. “The AI agent will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is.” Already Chung has begun laying the foundation. In mid-June, the company announced a 600-billion-won investment to build a 92,000-square-meter AI data center in Namyangju city, about 25 kilometers from Seoul. The data center—its second after last year’s launch of a facility in Ansan with 6 billion gigabytes of data storage capacity—will break ground in 2026 and is slated to open by 2029. By leveraging OpenAI’s LLMs, which undergird ChatGPT, Kakao is developing a suite of services with the aim of getting users to increase their time on the superapp—and spend more money while using it. “We saw diminishing returns trying to compete in the benchmark tests for the most powerful AI models, so we decided on a more practical approach seeking cost efficiency,” says Chung. OpenAI-powered AI agents have the potential to autonomously plan and take action across Kakao’s digital ecosystem, with limited human direction; for example, make a restaurant booking on behalf of a KakaoTalk user, add a calendar reminder, book a taxi and pay for a meal. That stickiness, Chung believes, will result in more ads—one of Kakao’s main revenue drivers—reaching users across its chats and channels. “AI enhances our core business, especially advertising and commerce,” she says. Advertising accounted for 15% of group revenue last year while its commerce unit contributed 11%. Kakao earns commissions of up to 8% per transaction for gifts sent between KakaoTalk users. An average of 600,000 gifts (from chocolate to vitamins to cosmetics and clothes) are exchanged daily, the company says, in the form of mobile vouchers that can be redeemed at participating restaurants and retailers or ordered from the platform’s gift shop. “The advertising business, which currently operates as the main cash cow of internet companies, will undergo dynamic changes with the introduction of AI-based services,” says Jingu Kim, a Seoul-based analyst at Kiwoom Securities. He predicts there will be a rapid uptake in B2C-based subscription plans that include AI agent services. “In this process, we expect that Kakao will be able to secure sustainable growth and level up its corporate value through its collaboration with OpenAI.” A Kakao Friends store selling character merchandise such as Ryan (the lion) and the radish-in-rabbit clothing Muzi. In a dry run with OpenAI’s tech in early May, Kakao launched a new standalone messaging app called Kanana for closed beta testing that features AI agents Kana and Nana. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT and its own small language model (SLM), it can assist users in personal and group chats by answering questions, summarizing group conversations, setting meeting times for events and sharing updates. Kakao declined to say how much it has spent but discloses that some 400 employees, or about 10% of its workforce, are working on AI projects. “For everyday-use cases, we don’t need to [invest in] a large language model,” says Chung, as that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to develop. Besides being cheaper to train and run, SLMs are safer to use as they’re less likely to provide incorrect answers to user queries, known as hallucinations, while also being more secure, she adds. It doesn’t require a network connection to a cloud, which is vulnerable to server breaches. Kakao will use its SLM to perform simple tasks, while relying on OpenAI’s powerful LLM to manage more complex, multistep and linked applications across Kakao’s ecosystem, says Chung. It’s the same strategy used by Apple: simple queries are answered by Siri, powered by Apple’s in-house Apple Intelligence LLM, and more complex questions are directed to ChatGPT. “Everyone was defaulting to GPUs for AI, but does it make sense to use the most expensive chips for small inference tasks?” explains Chung. A taxi operated by Korea Mobility. The company expects to complete Kanana’s closed beta testing in November, around the same time that it plans to launch the OpenAI-Kakao AI agent. “The virtual assistant will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is,” says Chung. “Because now you need to find which app to use, go to the app, take action. With agentic AI it will be seamless.” Alongside her tech focus, Chung has been striving to make Kakao leaner. This has involved shedding non-core businesses—the number of affiliates has dropped by a fifth over the past two years to 115 from 147, the company says. Then there’s the planned spin-off of Daum, the country’s second-largest portal site by daily visitors, which Kakao acquired in 2014. This will allow Chung to concentrate on juicing up other parts of Kakao’s portfolio, both domestic and overseas, and in particular its banking, entertainment and digital healthcare services. In June, a joint venture between its internet banking arm Kakao Bank and Thai financial group SCBX, which controls Siam Commercial Bank, received approval from the Thai government to establish a virtual bank in Thailand, making it the first Korean bank to operate in the country in 25 years. Earlier this year Kakao Entertainment announced the global launch of its fan-community app Berriz as Kakao Healthcare forged a partnership with Seoul-based elderly-care startup Caring and expanded into Japan. Source: Kakao Kakao’s sales started to lose steam after peaking at 2 trillion won in the third quarter of 2023. With the company being under pressure to boost revenue and earnings, founder Kim Beom-su embarked on an aggressive expansion of its entertainment portfolio. Kim, who has a 24% stake in Kakao and a net worth of $5.1 billion, made the fate­ful call to get into a bidding war for K-pop agency SM Entertainment with Korean billionaire Bang Si-hyuk’s Hybe, manager of boy band sensation BTS. While Kakao was ultimately successful, snatching a 35% stake in SM for 1.3 trillion won in March 2023, prosecutors alleged that Kim, long-hailed as an internet pioneer, had manipulated SM’s stock price to ward off Hybe. Kim, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested in July 2024 and is currently out on bail awaiting trial. In a statement to Kakao employees at the time, he said: “The allegations are not true. I have never instructed or condoned any illegal acts.” A crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” During the takeover battle for SM, Chung was running venture capital arm Kakao Ventures and also had a board seat at Kakao. She had made a name for herself as a VC investor with a portfolio that produced four unicorns. To steady the ship, Kakao’s board enlisted Chung as CEO last year. “I saw that period as a turning point for Kakao,” she recalls, adding that a crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” Chung’s forward-looking approach was honed over a 25-year career that has included roles at Boston Consulting Group, eBay and Kakao rival Naver. Chung studied French literature at Yonsei University in Seoul (not because she particularly liked French lit, she says, but because back then it was the subject du jour among brainy female students), followed by a master’s degree in marketing from the same college and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. Photo by Jaehyun Kim for Forbes Asia In 2014, she joined Kakao Ventures as a partner, becoming its CEO four years later. Her decade-long stint at the VC arm taught her how to deploy “my imagination with curiosity,” she says. “For example, the market for most early-stage investments wasn’t there yet, so I needed to imagine it.” She did just that with Kakao Ventures’ early backing of South Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, contributing 2 billion won of the 5.5 billion won in seed funding in 2020. Last December, Rebellions became the country’s first AI chip unicorn, valued at 1.3 trillion won, equivalent to $1 billion at the time, after it merged with a rival chipmaker owned by Korean billionaire Chey Tae-won’s SK Group (Kakao retains a stake). It’s not a given that Chung’s big tech bet will pay off. There are concerns in the industry that AI agents are more hype than substance, and could struggle to gain traction with users, much like Facebook’s metaverse, which saw the social media giant rebrand itself Meta and pour tens of billions of dollars into a virtual world project that has so far flopped. Alongside OpenAI, tech firms Google, Anthropic and Salesforce have debuted AI agents for consumers and businesses but they are nowhere near mainstream. OpenAI is also restricted in its use of personal data collected from Kanana agents, per a government review requested by Kakao over concerns about sharing personal information such as bank account and credit card details. Chat data must be stored in a database controlled by Kakao and can’t be used by OpenAI for commercial purposes, the Personal Information Protection Commission ruled. Kakao Pay is accepted at stores throughout South Korea. For now, a campaign promise by South Korea’s new president Lee Jae-myung to invest 100 trillion won in AI and introduce measures to support the country’s internet giants has led Kakao’s previously moribund shares to surge over 85% in the past two months. Investors also piled in over a proposed law that would allow companies in South Korea to issue won stablecoins, with Kakao’s listed payments platform Kakao Pay seen as one of the main beneficiaries. Kakao Pay shares rocketed before correcting sharply recently after regulators highlighted the risks associated with stablecoins. Chung’s shown the stamina and smarts to meet such challenges and has a secret weapon up her sleeve: imagination. “It will work very well,” she says. “Especially when new eras come.”
