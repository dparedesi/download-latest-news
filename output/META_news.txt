ByForbes Asia Team, Forbes Staff. When Forbes Asia launched in September 2005, it marked the start of a dedicated focus on, as we then described it, the world’s most economically dynamic region. Over the past two decades our network of reporters and editors has documented the titans and companies forming the backbone of Asia’s economies and creating the wealth that has underpinned regional growth. We’ve journeyed with our readers through China’s prosperity boom and slowdown, India’s transformation under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ASEAN’s trade and economic expansion, the fallout of the 2008 global financial crisis, and, most recently, the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. As the trusted chronicler of wealth, we’ve tracked the explosion in the number of billionaires in this region. There were 115 Asians worth a collective $364 billion on our World’s Billionaires list of 2006. This tally has since soared. In the 2025 rankings, there were a total of 1,046 billionaires from the Asia-Pacific, collectively worth $4.2 trillion. China (including Hong Kong) and India had the second- and third-largest number of billionaires in the world after the U.S., with 516 and 205, respectively. Our dozen country rich lists, where the typical minimum net worth requirement of $1 billion does not apply, cast a wider net, though in China and India that sum is no longer enough to earn a berth among their 100 richest. We drilled deeper to uncover top-performing businesses (and future billionaires) through our annual Best Under A Billion list, which highlights 200 publicly listed small and midsized companies with sales below $1 billion. In 2012 we kicked off an annual roster to celebrate the growing presence of Asia’s power businesswomen. And 2016 saw the debut of a regional 30 Under 30 list to foreground young achievers, including entrepreneurs, artists and athletes. Our 100 to Watch list of small companies and startups on the rise was launched five years ago. The accompanying pages showcase many of the moguls featured on our covers over the past 20 years whose achievements have contributed to planting Asia firmly on the global economic map. Edited by Mary E. Scott We shadowed India-born, U.S.-based venture capitalist Promod Haque of Norwest Venture Partners as he crisscrossed his homeland searching for high-tech gold. In his 35-year career, Haque rolled the dice on some 70 companies, roughly 10% in India, with a combined exit value of $40 billion. That put him on the Forbes Midas List of top VCs more than a dozen times. Now in a part-time role at Norwest, the 77-year-old still believes India provides ample “opportunity for great investment success.” This compendium of Asia-Pacific’s 200 top-performing small and midsized companies with annual revenue under $1 billion often has titans in the making. Notable alumni of the Best Under A Billion list over the years range from China’s Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent to Malaysia’s AirAsia and the Philippines’ Jollibee to India’s Infosys and Biocon. We highlighted Singapore Airlines in the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, when it posted profits amid high fuel prices and a threat from Dubai-based Emirates. It has since won accolades as one of the world’s best carriers. In 2024, we revisited the airline after it had scooped up a 25% stake in the privatized Air India, partnering with the Tata conglomerate. Net profit hit a record $2.8 billion in the year to March 31, though the Air India bet has yet to pay off. U.S.-educated brothers Victor and William Fung were named our 2006 businessmen of the year for converting their family company, Li & Fung, into a world-class enterprise connecting American and European consumers to factories in 40 countries. While they still retain significant stakes, Victor’s son Spencer is now group executive chairman. In 2020, the family partnered with Singapore logistics firm GLP to take Li & Fung private, delisting it from the Hong Kong stock exchange after a 28-year run. Korean skincare and cosmetics maker Amorepacific drew our attention long before the K-beauty phenomenon exploded, with products now routinely flogged by influencers on social media. In 2015, we named its billionaire chairman and CEO, Suh Kyung-bae, grandson of the founder, as businessman of the year. Today, as Americans panic buy their favorite K-beauty brands before the Trump tariffs hit, the company’s $3 billion in annual revenue looks set to get a lift. Nandan Nilekani was facing a problem at Infosys, the software company he cofounded: hiring 28,500 people in one year. In today’s AI world, the Indian IT behemoth has reportedly slowed recruitment. More than 80% of the 324,000 people it employs—up fivefold since 2006—are tagged “AI aware.” Nilekani left Infosys in 2009 to work with the government to build Aadhaar, India’s mammoth identity card scheme. A boardroom shake-up eight years later brought him back to Infosys as chairman. We profiled Li Ka-shing, nicknamed Superman, who at the time was the richest man in Asia and running his telecom-to-ports empire with an eye on China expansion. Today the 97-year-old’s CK Hutchison, from which he retired as chairman but remains as senior advisor, is in the throes of a complex $23 billion deal to sell its port assets, including two at the Panama Canal, which is strategically important to both the Americans and Chinese. The possible buyer is a consortium that includes U.S. investment firm BlackRock and, potentially, state-owned China Cosco Shipping. Li, who got his start making plastic flowers, is now among Asia’s richest with a $40 billion fortune. Vaccine billionaire Cyrus Poonawalla, founder of privately held Serum Institute of India, was the face of our 2007 list of 50 richest Indians. By 2014, the roster had expanded to 100 and each had to be worth at least $1 billion to qualify. In 2020, when the pandemic shut down the world, Poonawalla’s son Adar stepped up to produce a Covid-19 vaccine licensed from AstraZeneca. Last year was a record breaker for the list: the combined wealth of India’s 100 richest surpassed $1 trillion for the first time. When we met with Edwin Soeryadjaya, he was dead set on restoring the family fortune, wiped out when his father sold a stake in automotive group Astra to bail out a bank that was run by another son. Soeryadjaya rebuilt the clan’s wealth largely through a stake in coal miner Adaro. Lately he’s been greening his portfolio with solar and carbon-offset investments. Nvidia was named company of the year when the California-based chipmaker’s graphics processors were revolutionizing how we watched TV, gamed and used the internet. Today, the company is making a bigger killing as the supplier of the world’s most powerful AI chips, propelling its market cap to over $4 trillion. Founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s wealth has ballooned to $157 billion, making him the world’s seventh-richest person. In 2020, Hong Kong billionaire Francis Choi put his money behind biodegradable plastics to make environmentally friendly toys. This was a break from 2007, when Choi’s Early Light Industrial’s China-made toys for Mattel were found to contain lead paint. The “King of Toys” now has broader interests, from property to luxury watch retailing. Unfazed by the global financial crisis, brandy billionaire Andrew Tan teamed up with Malaysian gaming tycoon Lim Kok Thay’s Genting to invest $1.6 billion in building two casino resorts to make Manila the next Monte Carlo. While the partnership ended in 2023, it was a smart bet for Tan. Last year, the Philippines hit a record $7 billion in gross gaming revenue, higher than Singapore’s estimated $6 billion but dwarfed by the $27 billion for Macau, still the world’s top gambling city. Just months after featuring on our cover, William Amelio stepped down as CEO of Lenovo after a four-year stint; Yang Yuanqing—who in 2004 transformed Lenovo into a global tech player by buying IBM’s PC business for over $1 billion—was reinstated in his place, and founder Liu Chuanzi returned as chairman. The leadership overhaul came after sales plunged and the company slid into the red. Today, Lenovo is the world’s No. 1 PC maker in unit terms, up from No. 4 in 2008. Yang is CEO, chairman, and a billionaire. Liu is honorary chairman. Tadashi Yanai’s goal was to have more people wear his threads than those made by rivals Gap, H&M and Zara owner Inditex. He has since nearly tripled Uniqlo’s store network to some 2,500 outlets worldwide. Based on its $21 billion revenue for fiscal 2024, Yanai’s Fast Retailing has trounced Gap, is closing in on H&M, but has still to catch up with Inditex. Yanai, who became Japan’s richest person in 2009 and is now worth $45 billion, has said that he spends the bulk of his time mentoring potential successors. Our World’s Billionaires List saw a wealth meltdown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and India’s Gautam Adani was no exception. We met the commodities-and-infrastructure tycoon three months after he’d narrowly survived a terror attack by gunmen in a Mumbai hotel. Atop a shipping container at his Mundra port, Adani posed gamely for our photographer. He went on to greater heights, briefly surpassing the likes of Jeff Bezos, Warren Buffett and fellow Indian Mukesh Ambani in 2022 to become the world’s second-richest person, worth $143 billion. Months later, that went into freefall when U.S. firm Hindenburg Research accused Adani and his companies of financial fraud and stock market manipulation, allegations the businessman denied. His wealth has climbed again since, though not to the same stratospheric level. One year after we profiled Baidu cofounder and CEO Robin Li, Google quit China amid a cyberattack and concerns about censorship, clearing the way for Baidu to become the mainland’s top search engine. The homegrown internet giant has waded into cloud computing and is investing heavily in AI with a ChatGPT-like service called Ernie. Australian trucking billionaire Lindsay Fox declared that the global economic downturn had delivered a record year for his privately owned Linfox, a mover of goods across Asia-Pacific: “Everyone’s eating more at home, everyone’s drinking, and everybody who’s a miner is digging.” A decade later, Covid-19 was a mixed bag. Linfox snagged a government contract to transport tens of millions of vaccines but profits were hit by higher supply chain costs. Fox, 88, has handed running of the business to son and executive chairman Peter. Quitting his career as a banker, Singapore’s Simon Cheong plunged into property development, founding SC Global in 1996 to build ultra-luxury properties, well before the influx of the wealthy from overseas turned into a flood. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Cheong set a then-record with the Marq, where a four-bedroom unit fetched $16 million in 2011. Tony Fernandes single-handedly made air travel affordable for millions of people when he relaunched AirAsia as a no-frills carrier in 2001. The journey’s been bumpy at times, but the former music industry executive is still flying high as CEO of Capital A, the holding company for the Malaysia-based airline. Charles Chao, CEO of news and entertainment portal Sina, launched microblog Weibo just as Twitter (now X) and Facebook (now Meta) were banned in China. Weibo took off, becoming a forum for popular opinion since surging to 600 million active monthly users. But its Nasdaq-listed shares are down about 90% from a high of $142 in 2018, battered by a massive data breach in 2020 and a weak advertising market. Our reporter tagged along with Jackie Chan as he raced around Asia combining his job as an action movie celebrity with charitable works, which put him on our annual Heroes of Philanthropy list. His Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation, launched in 1988, offers scholarships to students as well as medical services and aid during natural disasters. In 2004, he kicked off his Dragon’s Heart Foundation to build schools and help the elderly in remote parts of mainland China. Chan has said he plans to give his estimated $400 million fortune to charity when he dies. Thailand’s richest person, Dhanin Chearavanont, was then busy hatching a plan for his Charoen Pokphand group, an early mover in China, to build megafarms to feed the country’s growing middle class. In 2024, the group’s Bangkok-listed CP Foods unit drew two-thirds of its $18 billion revenue from overseas. Dhanin stepped back from running his agribusiness-to-telecoms conglomerate in 2017, handing charge to his two sons, though he remains senior chairman. Teresita Sy-Coson was the cover star for our inaugural Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. More than a decade later she remains at the top of the Sy family’s SM Investments holding company, building on the vision of her father, founder Henry Sy, who died in 2019. In the 20 years since listing on the Philippine Stock Exchange, the retail, banking and property conglomerate has seen its shares soar almost sevenfold. Vincent Tan brought McDonald’s to Malaysia, laying the foundation for Berjaya, a retail, property and financial services group that made him one of the country’s richest people. But in 2012, on turning 60, Tan took a back seat to embark on a new mission, helping ordinary Malaysians speak better English. Tan returned as Berjaya’s executive chairman five years later, moving into an advisory role in 2023. He reportedly plans to donate half his estimated $800 million fortune to charity. At the time, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), founded by Morris Chang in 1987, was growing fast, driven by surging demand for its chips for smartphones and tablets. Today, the AI boom is fueling sales at one of the world’s largest chipmakers, with Apple and Nvidia among its biggest customers. With substantial investments in the U.S., TSMC is likely to be exempted from Trump’s tariffs. Chang, 94, who has long since retired, was named by Forbes in 2017 as one of the 100 Greatest Living Business Minds. Peter Woo, one of Hong Kong’s ten richest people, spoke to us at a time when Hong Kongers were complaining about the influx of mainland Chinese visitors. The owner of two flagship shopping malls, whose wealth had doubled in a year to $8 billion thanks to the shopping frenzy, was more welcoming. Two years later, Woo handed charge of his holding company, Wheelock, to son Douglas. We outed Pham Nhat Vuong, founder and chairman of Vingroup, one of Vietnam’s largest conglomerates, as the country’s first billionaire. The self-made Vuong, now worth around $13 billion and the country’s richest person, has been on an expansion binge since, muscling into everything from EVs to renewable energy and hotels. In June, Vingroup revealed plans to build a $14 billion port-and-logistics hub outside Hanoi, where it is based. The founder and executive chairperson of Biocon, which made her the richest self-made woman in India when it went public in 2004, has poured her energy and resources into making a range of low-cost drugs, including for chronic diseases. After losing a friend to cancer, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw set up a cancer center in Bangalore as well as centers for advanced therapeutics and research. Shaw, now 72, whose late husband, John, was also a cancer patient, has pledged to leave 75% of her $3.3 billion wealth to charity. Chew Gek Khim wrested control of Singapore’s Straits Trading in 2008 after a high-profile bidding war with OCBC’s Lee family. Then she got busy revamping the staid colonial-era tin smelter into a sleek 21st-century holding company, broadening its activities to include property, hospitality and asset management. Known for her signature cheongsams, Chew still runs the show as executive chairman. Neil Shen cofounded Sequoia Capital China in 2005, at a time when Chinese internet companies were way behind their American counterparts, and turned it into an investment juggernaut. The key, disclosed the China-born, Yale-educated Shen, was to understand Chinese culture and business practices. Sequoia Capital China was split from its Silicon Valley parent in 2024 and renamed HongShan Capital Group, where Shen is founder and managing partner. The billionaire investor has been on our Midas list more than a dozen times. Piyush Gupta retired as CEO of Singapore’s DBS in March, more than a decade after he shared with us his plan to turn the stodgy local bank into a nimble regional player by digitalizing its services. The bank has been named the world’s best digital bank several times and continues to harness cutting-edge technology such as blockchain and AI. Gupta handed charge to DBS veteran Tan Su Shan, who earned a place on our Asia’s Power Businesswomen list in 2024. Lei Jun, founder, chairman and CEO of China’s Xiaomi, which made smartphones affordable for hundreds of millions of people, was a shoo-in for our businessman of the year. Xiaomi, which means “small rice” in Mandarin, was founded in 2010. Since our sit-down with Lei, it has expanded its portfolio to include wearables, IoT devices and more recently, EVs. Lei’s $42 billion fortune makes him China’s sixth-richest person today. This issue was largely dedicated to Singapore’s founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, who died March 23, 2015. Remembered by Steve Forbes and others as one of the great statesmen of the post-WWII era, LKY was a clear-eyed pragmatist with superb political skills who built Singapore into the economic powerhouse it is today. LKY also shared his views with our readers as a Forbes columnist for 15 years, starting in 2001. The then-34-year-old Frank Wang was the world’s first drone billionaire, having amassed a fortune with DJI, the company he founded in 2006 and ran out of his dorm room at a Hong Kong university. Today, Shenzhen-based DJI continues to dominate the consumer-drone space, giving Wang a net worth of $5.4 billion. Nepal’s first, and only, billionaire, Binod Chaudhary, raced to the rescue when a 7.8 Richter-scale earthquake devastated the country, distributing essentials in the immediate aftermath, including his company’s Wai Wai instant noodles, and helping longer term with rebuilding. His Chaudhary Foundation, the philanthropic arm of his CG Corp Global conglomerate, was set up in 1995 to support education, disaster management and healthcare, particularly for children. The year marked our first 30 Under 30 Asia list of the Millennials making good in this part of the world. Ten editions later, the roster continues to showcase young entrepreneurs, innovators and artists who are disrupting their chosen fields; only now, Gen Z is taking over, with nearly half of the 2025 cohort aged 27 or under. We flagged Nita Ambani, wife of Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, as the first lady of Indian business and an Asian power businesswoman. At the time, she was a Reliance director, overseeing the launch and branding of telecoms arm Jio, which now has almost 500 million subscribers. Though she retired from the board in 2023 as her children stepped up, she remains chairperson of philanthropic arm Reliance Foundation and is even more visible today. Nita shows up at Premier League cricket matches, rooting for Reliance’s Mumbai Indians team. As a member of the International Olympic Committee, she’s lobbying for the Games to be held in India. A prominent cultural and convention center in Mumbai that was her brainchild bears her name. Hary Tanoesoedibjo, founder and executive chairman of Media Nusantara Citra group, is sometimes called Indonesia’s Donald Trump. Hary (as local media call him) built a fortune in real estate and TV broadcasting and likes to post on social media. He also happens to be the U.S. president’s business partner, owning several Trump-branded resorts in Indonesia. Hary attended the 2017 presidential inauguration and was hobnobbing in Washington D.C. when Trump was sworn in for his second term. He had ambitions to become Indonesia’s president but gave control of the political party he founded to daughter Angela last year. Sonia Cheng grew up in hotels owned by New World Development, a property company founded by her grandfather, Cheng Yu-tung. Under her guidance as CEO, its Rosewood Hotels brand, acquired in 2011, was quickly becoming one of the world’s fastest-growing upscale hotel chains. It now manages 33 properties, including The Carlyle in New York and Hotel de Crillon in Paris, with 27 more being developed. In 2022 Cheng also took on the role of co-vice chairman at Chow Tai Fook Jewellery, the Cheng family’s crown jewel. Meanwhile, New World has been weighed down lately by debt. What was only a dream in 2017 is now reality: Wang Chuanfu’s BYD is the largest EV maker in the world in terms of auto sales. The company’s 2024 revenue exceeded $100 billion, blowing past chief rival Tesla. However, BYD’s shares are off the all-time high they hit in May as investors worry about an EV price war. Joseph Tsai, cofounder and then-executive vice chairman of e-commerce giant Alibaba, had a slam-dunk year in 2017. Of note: his high-profile acquisition of 49% of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team for $1 billion. Three years later, the sports fan paid nearly $1.4 billion for the remaining stake. (He has since sold part of his holding but maintains control.) Tsai rose to chairman of Alibaba in 2023 and is now worth $11.5 billion. We were among the first to spot standout executive Jane Jie Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group (formerly Ctrip). She was in the midst of transforming the China-based online travel agency into a global player that today offers the gamut, from flights and hotels to rail travel and rental cars anywhere in the world. Sun still runs the company—and marathons. Referred to by his staff as “big brother Zhang,” the high school dropout became the world’s richest eatery entrepreneur after listing his Sichuan hot pot chain, Haidilao, in 2018. The business, which Zhang Yong cofounded with his wife, Shu Ping, is not quite sizzling these days. A consumer spending slump in mainland China prompted Zhang, now a Singapore citizen and resident, to diversify into other dining options as well as focus on U.S. expansion. In an exclusive interview, Eduardo Saverin, cofounder of Facebook, explained the investment mantra of B Capital Group, the venture capital firm he established with business partner Raj Ganguly. The duo, based in Singapore and Los Angeles, respectively, were out to prove that innovation can happen anywhere, not just in Silicon Valley. It certainly has. B Capital’s assets under management now stand at $8 billion, invested in more than 190 companies in sectors such as healthcare and AI. Once China’s richest person, beverage billionaire Zong Qinghou talked candidly of his efforts to rekindle sales at his privately held Hangzhou Wahaha Group with its portfolio of bottled water and milk drinks. He also spoke about his daughter, Kelly, as a potential successor. A year after Zong’s death in 2024, Kelly, who now leads Wahaha, is embroiled in an inheritance fight with three people who claim to be the late Zong’s offspring. In the year 2000, Forbes Global (the forerunner of Forbes Asia) put Jack Ma, cofounder of China’s Alibaba, on its cover when the e-commerce company had just 150 employees (vs 124,000 today). Almost two decades later, as Ma stepped down as chairman, announcing that he was switching his focus to philanthropy, he graced the cover again. The former teacher’s meteoric rise as one of China's top tech entrepreneurs earned him the Malcolm S. Forbes Lifetime Achievement Award in 2019. Martin and Peter Lee, the sons of Lee Shau Kee, then Hong Kong’s richest person, had spent less than a year as co-chairmen at the family’s property flagship, Henderson Land, when they agreed to open up about how they planned to carry the legacy forward. The patriarch’s death in March 2025 makes them co-owners of one of Hong Kong’s largest landlords at a time when the property market is in a prolonged slump. In 2020, Masayoshi Son, founder of Japanese investment giant SoftBank, had hit a wall. Some big-money bets made by his $100 billion Vision Fund had gone spectacularly south, forcing Son to divest assets to pay down debt. Today, the entrepreneur has a new vision, one focused on AI, with investments in ChatGPT creator OpenAI and chip giants Nvidia, TSMC and Intel. The result: Softbank returned to profit in fiscal 2025 after four years in the red, and a surge in its stock has made Son once again Japan’s richest person with a $54 billion fortune. When most businesses were reeling under Covid-19 lockdowns, Singapore-based Sea, an online provider of shopping, games and payment services, led by cofounder Forrest Li, was on a high. It had become Singapore’s most valuable company with a market cap of $69 billion. Today, New York Stock Exchange-listed Sea’s market cap exceeds $110 billion amid buoyant revenue from its gaming (Garena), e-commerce (Shopee) and payments (Monee) arms. Li was first covered by us as an entrepreneur to watch in 2010. Roshni Nadar Malhotra became chairperson of HCL Technologies in 2020, taking over from her billionaire father, Shiv Nadar, who cofounded the company as a garage startup in 1976. That made the former TV news producer one of the first women to lead a listed IT outfit in India and earned her a spot on our annual Asia’s Power Businesswomen list. With the successful takeover of Indonesia’s Bank Permata in 2020, third-generation president Chartsiri Sophonpanich set the stage for a significant expansion of Bangkok Bank’s regional presence. The $2.7 billion deal was the biggest in the bank’s history and marked a departure from its past strategy of growing organically. It also gave Chartsiri, who agreed to a rare interview, a way to cement his legacy at the institution cofounded by his grandfather in 1944. Grab’s group CEO, Anthony Tan, gave us the lowdown on how he planned to take his Singapore-headquartered superapp company, best known for its ride-hailing and delivery services, to the next level. His blueprint included transforming Grab, which he cofounded in 2012, into a listed entity and boosting its presence in fintech. A month later, Grab went public on the Nasdaq via a SPAC merger that valued the company at $40 billion, making it the biggest-ever listing of a Southeast Asian business. Its market cap has since halved to $21 billion. Data centers are multiplying around the world, and one person who saw the coming wave and rode it to become a multibillionaire is Otto Toto Sugiri, cofounder of DCI, Indonesia’s biggest data center operator by capacity. The serial tech entrepreneur launched the country’s first internet service provider in 1994 and is sometimes referred to as Indonesia’s Bill Gates. We sat down with GGV Capital’s Jenny Lee, the first woman to break into the top ten of the Midas ranking in 2012 and who had just completed an unbroken, 11-year run on that list. Now as senior managing partner at Granite Asia, which was split off from GGV in 2024, Singapore-based Lee’s winning streak continues. She was at No. 75 on this year’s Midas List and successfully launched Granite’s first private credit fund in May, securing more than half the targeted $500 million from anchor investors. In the Philippines, billionaire Enrique Razon, known for his twin successes in ports and casinos, was systematically building a third source of wealth: infrastructure. With interests in water utilities, hydropower, gas fields and solar farms, Razon stressed he wasn’t fazed by bureaucratic hurdles. “We’re very persistent, very aggressive. We don’t make crazy proposals. We study things very carefully.” Skyrocketing coal prices resulted in a fivefold jump in the wealth of Low Tuck Kwong, the founder of coal miner Bayan Resources, pushing him to No. 2 on our Indonesia rich list from No. 18 the year before, with a $12.1 billion fortune that has since more than doubled. Despite the global shift toward renewables, Low said he was confident the so-called black gold had a profitable future and of Bayan’s industry prospects, thanks to its low-cost base and low-emissions coal. Hong Kong developer Vincent Lo gambled big on mainland China after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, ploughing money into his Xintiandi lifestyle and entertainment district in Shanghai. The bet paid off, turning his listed Shui On Land into his empire’s crown jewel. A meticulous planner, Lo chose daughter Stephanie as his successor. He continues to bet on China, despite its property distress, agreeing in June to invest in a premium Shanghai project. The wealthy Aboitiz family of the Philippines has a track record of reinventing its portfolio to keep pace with the times. We dug deep into Sabin Aboitiz’s $7 billion blueprint to expand century-old Aboitiz Equity Ventures, the country’s second-biggest electricity producer, into a banking, infrastructure and F&B powerhouse. “We’re transforming from a 100-year-old man to a 25-year-old athlete,” the fourth-generation president and CEO said. Malaysian billionaire brothers Lee Yeow Chor and Lee Yeow Seng, who inherited palm oil business IOI from their late father, Lee Shin Cheng, caught our eye for their bet on property in neighboring Singapore. Up next: a REIT listing that could hold as much as $6.2 billion in assets. The repositioning of Philippine F&B giant San Miguel as a nation builder by chairman Ramon Ang was a compelling story of a self-driven tycoon seeking to cement his legacy while preparing his son John Paul Ang to carry it forward. Third-generation scion Miwako Date’s strategy to double down on Mori Trust’s hotels and resorts business now looks savvy: visitors to Japan, led by the Chinese, surged 21% in the first half of 2025 to 22 million, putting the country on track to draw 45 million visitors this year, as estimated by Mori. Kuok Meng Wei, whose legendary grandfather Robert Kuok was described by Forbes as the world’s shrewdest businessman in a 1997 cover story, revealed his strategy of driving the storied Kuok Group into what he believes is the hottest industry in decades. Backed by his family, the 42-year-old’s K2 Strategic has become one of the leading builders of data centers in the region, notably in Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand. Not long after she brokered a deal with Sam Altman of OpenAI, Shina Chung, the first woman CEO of Kakao, outlined to us her plan to tap its next-gen technology for AI virtual assistants to jumpstart growth at the Korean internet giant. Nikhil Sawhney, fourth-generation successor of a Delhi clan that got its start in the sugar business, gave us the lowdown on how he transformed Triveni Turbine, a company appearing on our Best Under A Billion list for the second year, from a small domestic outfit into the world’s second-largest maker of turbines of up to 100MW capacity. His strategy: a laser focus on R&D and staying “paranoid” about competition.

Title: Job Growth Sputters: Rate Cuts And Recession Incoming?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Worse-than-expected job growth on Friday sent the S&P 500 lower after reaching a closing high on Thursday. Employment grew by just 22,000 nonfarm jobs, which was below expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, though only by 21,000, compared to the massive downward revision last month. The household survey data were solid, with a gain of 288,000 jobs following a decline of 260,000 jobs the previous month. The household survey research series, which aligns with the payroll report criteria, increased by 781,000. The significant increase in the research series is merely little more than a slight reversal of the 753,000 decline from the previous month. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3% from 4.2%. This increase in unemployment was mainly due to relatively positive reasons, with job gains of 288,000 in the household survey and an increase of 436,000 in the labor force. The underemployment rate is a broader measure of unemployment, which includes “unemployed people, plus everyone marginally attached to the workforce, plus all people employed part-time for economic reasons.” The underemployment rate is 1.5 percentage points above the December 2022 low, while the unemployment rate has risen 0.9 percentage points from its low. The underemployment rate can serve as a leading indicator of unemployment, reflecting the growing slack in the labor market. Wage growth was below expectations at 3.7% year-over-year, down from 3.9% last month. The average workweek hours held steady at 34.2, just above the five-year low of 34.1 in January, which was depressed by weather and the LA fires. Monitoring the employment-to-population ratio among prime-age individuals, aged 25 to 54, should signal when concern about the unemployment rate is warranted. The three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio has been teetering around the current level, but the labor market has remained resilient. It should be monitored closely, but it has been able to maintain a steady level so far and improved fractionally this month. Initial weekly filings for unemployment benefits remain benign. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired after losing their jobs. The Sahm Rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises by 0.5 percentage points or more relative to its low during the previous 12 months. The three-month average of the US unemployment rate is 4.23%, well below the 4.51% Sahm Rule trigger. The Sahm Rule has had an unblemished historical record of predicting recessions. However, its perfection is in jeopardy since the rule was triggered in July and September 2024 with no economic contraction yet in sight. Another useful predictor of recessions has been earnings growth, as a recession is typically associated with a year-over-year decline in corporate profits. For this analysis, the NIPA corporate profits are used rather than S&P 500 earnings. NIPA data includes all US companies, including both public and private entities, as well as small companies and S corporations. For the second quarter of 2025, NIPA profits grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which remains positive but looks to be decelerating. Notably, S&P 500 earnings grew at a 12% year-over-year pace; however, much of that rapid growth was driven by technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Therefore, NIPA provides a better window into the overall economy. Following the weaker jobs data, markets expect three 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025. The softer labor market has made a 25-basis-point cut at the Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting a virtual certainty. Bottom line: Following the shockingly large downward revision last month, this month’s jobs report makes it clear that the labor market has been softening and is teetering on the edge. These facts will not escape the Fed’s notice, so a September rate cut is now a fait accompli following the release of the monthly payrolls report last week. The S&P 500 reached an all-time high during the week but declined fractionally on Friday following the release of the jobs report. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed primarily due to a favorable legal outcome for Alphabet and enthusiasm about Elon Musk’s ambitious Tesla performance targets. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied to new highs. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Though the recession odds rose intra-week, the betting odds held steady week-over-week. There are only four companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, but Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe (ADBE) are certainly notable. Producer (PPI) and consumer inflation (CPI) rates for August are scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday respectively. While a higher-than-expected PPI report would garner attention, the CPI will be more critical, as the extent to which price increases, including those from tariffs, reach consumers is the crucial variable. CPI is expected to rise year-over-year to 2.9% from 2.7%. The consensus forecast is consistent with the estimates from the Cleveland Fed, so this result is unlikely to hinder the September rate cut. A hot set of inflation reports would likely decrease the number of rate cuts expected in 2025, rather than endangering the September move. Despite the slight decline on Friday, stocks are still pricing in low odds of recession and forecasting that the Fed will begin rate cuts soon enough for this to remain a soft spot in the labor market rather than a full-fledged downturn. The bond market is less sure of the Fed’s success, with corporate bond spreads widening to levels last seen during the build-up to the tariff worries earlier in the year. While conditions should be monitored closely, there is currently little evidence of an impending recession. However, as noted, some storm clouds are on the horizon that could shift the economy in that direction.

Title: Deutsche Bank on ‘the summer AI turned ugly’: markets are ‘more sober’ than the dotcom bubble, but with troubling data-center math

Full Content:
Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. Deutsche Bank analysts have been watching Amazon Prime, it seems. Specifically, the “breakout” show of the summer, “The Summer I Turned Pretty.” In the AI sphere, analysts Adrian Cox and Stefan Abrudan wrote, it was the summer AI “turned ugly,” with several emerging themes that will set the course for the final quarter of the year. Paramount among them: The rising fear over whether AI has driven Big Tech stocks into the kind of frothy territory that precedes a sharp drop. The AI news cycle of the summer captured themes including the challenge of starting a career, the importance of technology in the China/U.S. trade war, and mounting anxiety about the impact of the technology. But in terms of finance and investing, Deutsche Bank sees markets “on edge” and hoping for a soft landing amid bubble fears. In part, it blames tech CEOs for egging on the market with overpromises, leading to inflated hopes and dreams, many spurred on by tech leaders’ overpromises. It also sees a major impact from the venture capital space, boosting startups’ valuations, and from the lawyers who are very busy filing lawsuits for all kinds of AI players. It’s ugly out there. But the market is actually “more sober” in many ways than the situation from the late 1990s, the German bank argues. Still, Wall Street is not Main Street, and Deutsche Bank notes troubling math about the data centers sprouting up on the outskirts of your town. Specifically, the bank flags a back-of-the-envelope analysis from hedge fund Praetorian Capital that suggests hyperscalers’ massive data center investments could be setting up the market for negative returns, echoing past cycles of “capital destruction.” AI has captured the market’s imagination, with Cox and Abrudan noting, “it’s clear there is a lot of hype.” Web searches for AI are 10 times as high as they ever were for crypto, the bank said, citing Google Trends data, while it also finds that S&P 500 companies mentioned “AI” over 3,300 times in their earnings calls this past quarter. Stock valuations overall have soared alongside the “Magnificent Seven” tech firms, which collectively comprise a third of the S&P 500’s market cap. (The most magnificent: Nvidia, now the world’s most valuable company at a market cap exceeding $4 trillion.) Yet Deutsche Bank points out that today’s top tech players have healthier balance sheets and more resilient business models than the high flyers of the dotcom era. By most ratios, the bank said, valuations “still look more sober than those for hot stocks at the height of the dot-com bubble,” when the Nasdaq more than tripled in less than 18 months to March 2000, then lost 75% of its value by late 2002. By price-to-earnings ratio, Alphabet and Meta are in the mid-20x range, while Amazon and Microsoft trade in the mid-30x range. By comparison, Cisco surpassed 200x during the dotcom bubble, and even Microsoft reached 80x. Nvidia is “only” 50x, Deutsche Bank noted. Despite the relative restraint in share prices, AI’s real risk may be lurking away from its stock-market valuations, in the economics of its infrastructure. Deutsche Bank cites a blog post by Praetorian Capital “that has been doing the rounds.” The post in “Kuppy’s Korner,” named for the fund’s CEO Harris “Kuppy” Kupperman, estimates that hyperscalers’ total data-center spending for 2025 could hit $400 billion, and the bank notes that is roughly the size of the GDP of Malaysia or Egypt. The problem, according to the hedge fund, is that the data centers will depreciate by roughly $40 billion per year, while they currently generate no more than $20 billion of annual revenue. How is that supposed to work? “Now, remember, revenue today is running at $15 to $20 billion,” the blog post says, explaining that revenue needs to grow at least tenfold just to cover the depreciation. Even assuming future margins rise to 25%, the blog post estimates that the sector would require a stunning $160 billion in annual revenue from the AI powered by those data centers just to break even on depreciation—and nearly $480 billion to deliver a modest 20% return on invested capital. For context, even giants like Netflix and Microsoft Office 365 at their peaks brought in less than a fraction of that figure. Even at that level, “you’d need $480 billion of AI revenue to hit your target return … $480 billion is a LOT of revenue for guys like me who don’t even pay a monthly fee today for the product.” Going from $20 billion to $480 billion could take a long time, if ever, is the implication, and sometime before the big AI platforms reach those levels, their earnings, and presumably their shares, could take a hit. Deutsche Bank itself isn’t as pessimistic. The bank notes that the data-center buildout is producing a greatly reduced cost for each use of an AI model, as startups are reaching “meaningful scale in cloud consumption.” Also, consumer AI such as ChatGPT and Gemini is growing fast, with OpenAI saying in August that ChatGPT had over 700 million weekly users, plus 5 million paying business users, up from 3 million three months earlier. The cost to query an AI model (subsidized by the venture capital sector, to be sure) has fallen by around 99.7% in the two years since the launch of ChatGPT and is still headed downward. Praetorian Capital draws two historical parallels to the current situation: the dotcom era’s fiber buildout, which led to the bankruptcy of Global Crossing, and the more recent capital bust of shale oil. In each case, the underlying technology is real and transformative—but overzealous spending with little regard for returns could leave investors holding the bag if progress stalls. The “arms race” mentality now gripping the hyperscalers’ massive capex buildout mirrors the capital intensity of those past crises, and as Praetorian notes, “even the MAG7 will not be immune” if shareholder patience runs out. Per Kuppy’s Korner, “the megacap tech names are forced to lever up to keep buying chips, after having outrun their own cash flows; or they give up on the arms race, writing off the past few years of capex … Like many things in finance, it’s all pretty obvious where this will end up, it’s the timing that’s the hard part.” This cycle, Deutsche Bank argues, is being sustained by robust earnings and more conservative valuations than the dotcom era, but “periodic corrections are welcome, releasing some steam from the system and guarding against complacency.” If revenue growth fails to keep up with depreciation and replacement needs, investors may force a harsh reckoning—one characterized not by spectacular innovation but by a slow realization of negative returns. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is the richest person in the world and he's all set to get richer. Musk, whose current net worth is close to $378 billion, was the first person to have a net worth of over $400 billion in December 2024, according to Bloomberg. Now, a proposed new pay package could make him a trillionaire. Tesla (TSLA) is asking its investors to approve a massive pay package for Musk which would be valued at nearly $1 trillion if he can lead the company to achieve certain valuation and operations milestones over the next 10 years, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing. Musk's net worth is largely driven by his stakes in Tesla and privately held rocket and satellite manufacturing company, SpaceX. The additional shares under the new pay deal could push the value of Musk-owned Tesla shares to over $2 trillion. Tesla's share price increased more than 60% in 2024, with some of those gains coming after President Trump won the election in November. The company's shares were trading 8% lower year-to-date as of Sept. 5, 2025. An insider share sale of SpaceX in December 2024 also boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk was vocal in his support for Trump, Forbes reported, joining him on the campaign trail and becoming Trump's second largest donor by putting $118 million into America PAC, which Musk created. He also served on Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency till May this year. Musk's wealth surpasses other notable billionnaires including Amazon.com (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta's (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison according to Forbes and Bloomberg. Here's how the Tesla CEO made his billions. Tesla is one of the largest carmakers in the world. The company builds and designs fully electric vehicles and also makes energy generation and storage products like solar panels, solar roof tiles, and battery systems. Its vehicles include sedans, mid-size SUVs and the CyberTruck. Tesla was founded in 2003 as Tesla Motors by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Musk invested in the company and was a member of the board starting in 2004. He became CEO in 2008. Musk was allowed to claim the title of cofounder after an out-of-court settlement. Tesla went public in an initial public offering (IPO) on June 29, 2010. In 2021, Tesla moved its headquarters from its native Palo Alto, Calif., to Austin, Texas. In July 2023, Tesla unveiled its first Cybertruck built in its Texas factory, almost two years behind the original schedule. Musk is Tesla's largest shareholder, and owns 19.7% of the company's stock as of August 29, 2025. Musk is also the cofounder and CEO of SpaceX, a rocket manufacturing company that counts NASA as a client and helps resupply the International Space Station. SpaceX became the most valuable startup in the world when it considered raising funds at a $400 billion valuation in July 2025, according to Bloomberg. Musk owns 42% of SpaceX, which has launched over 400 rockets since it was founded in 2002, and has more than 4 million subscribers for its Starlink internet service. In April 2022, Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion after threatening a hostile takeover. The deal was finalized in October 2022 after Twitter sued Musk for trying to back out of the deal. His takeover has been controversial, as he laid off much of the company’s workforce and added a paid subscription service ($8 per month) for anyone who wants their account verified. In July 2023, Musk rebranded Twitter as X, replacing the blue bird logo with the letter. Fidelity estimates that X is worth about $9.4 billion, according to Forbes, per disclosures released by the investment firm in September 2024. Fidelity's stake in X is now worth about $4.19 million, down about 79% before Musk bought X. Musk founded artificial intelligence firm xAI in 2023. In July 2025, the company was looking to raise fund from investors that would peg its valuation up to $200 billion, according to the Financial Times. The company also raised $10 billion vis loans and cash investments in June, following a $300 million share sale in July, the Financial Times reported. Musk owns about 54% of xAI, per Forbes. The team at xAI is led by Musk and others who have previously worked with OpenAI, DeepMind, Google Research, Microsoft Research, and Tesla. Musk is also the founder of The Boring Company, a construction company that aims to “solve traffic” by building tunnels. The company raised $675 million in April 2022 at a valuation of $5.7 billion, according to a release. Musk co-founded a company called Neuralink which designed a "brain-computer interface," a chip that can be implanted into the brain and would allow users to control their computers and mobile devices with their thoughts. According to the company's website, Neuralink is working to help those with quadriplegia, a symptom of paralysis that affects a person's limbs and body from the neck down, with the ability to control their devices with their thoughts. The company, which launched its first human trial in January 2024, was valued at an estimated $9 billion, after a raising $600 million earlier this year according to Semafor.

Title: Google's $3.5B Fine Signals End of Big Tech's Free Pass

Google's regulatory reckoning has finally arrivedâand it's expensive. The tech giant is facing a historic $3.5 billion fine from European authorities for breaking antitrust laws, but this is just the tip of the iceberg. With courts finding Google liable for maintaining monopoly power and global antitrust enforcement fines hitting $6.7 billion in 2024âmore than double 2023's totalâwe're witnessing a fundamental shift in how regulators approach Big Tech monopolies. PRO TIP: This isn't just about one company getting fined. The coordinated global crackdown on Google represents the end of Big Tech's "move fast and break things" era. For consumers and competitors, this could mean real change in how we access information and digital services. Let's break down the scale of Google's legal troubles. In April 2025, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google liable for 'willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power' through its integration of advertising tools. The court found that Google violated antitrust laws by monopolizing open-web digital advertising markets for over 15 years, manipulating ad-tech auctions and stifling competition. Here's where it gets interesting: Google's dominance isn't just about search. The company commands more than 90% of Android app downloads and processes over 24 billion updates per week through its Play Store. That level of control means Google decides which developers succeed, what users can access, and how much everyone pays. The EU's approach has been particularly aggressive. The Digital Markets Act designated Google as a 'gatekeeper', imposing strict data governance rules. The EU can fine companies up to 10% of their global annual revenue for DMA violations, which translates to a potential $35 billion maximum penalty based on Google's 2024 earnings. The genius of Google's strategyâand what makes it so problematicâlies in how its 2008 DoubleClick acquisition created the infrastructure for today's violations. By purchasing the dominant ad-serving platform, Google didn't just buy a competitor; it acquired the tools to control every step of the digital advertising process. This acquisition enabled Google to implement the DMA-violating practices and Play Store restrictions that courts are now finding illegalâturning what appeared to be routine business expansion into the foundation of systematic market manipulation. Google's advertising empire is where the real money flowsâand where regulators are focusing their firepower. These ad tech tools account for roughly $95 billion in annual revenue, approximately 15% of Alphabet's total revenue. But here's the kicker: Google's advertising technologies generate about $30 billion annually and form the backbone of internet economics. The DOJ's case reveals how Google systematically eliminated competition. The DOJ has demanded a structural divestiture of Google's ad tech business, including the sale of DFP and AdX. Internal evidence shows Google takes a 20 percent commission on transactions carried out through its ad exchange, while Google's DFP ad server has enjoyed a market share of 84 to 90 per cent over the last ten years. The court's findings are damning. Google engaged in unlawful conduct to maintain monopolies by limiting publisher ad server access and requiring publishers who wanted access to AdX to use DFP. This isn't just market dominanceâit's market manipulation. Bottom line: Google essentially became the auctioneer, the auction house, and the payment processor all at once. When competitors tried to offer better deals or more innovative solutions, Google made it increasingly difficult for them to participate. Internal documents revealed that Google deliberately designed its systems to favor its own servicesâand when publishers tried to resist these changes, Google knew they had no choice but to comply or lose access to essential advertising revenue. The European Commission isn't playing games. Abuse of dominance decisions by The European Commission accounted for over 75% of the overall global fine volume in 2024. Beyond Google, the EC set its third ever highest fine with its EUR1.84 billion fine on Apple and fined Meta EUR792.7 million for abusing its dominance. Google's European troubles run deep. The EU's top court upheld a record-breaking â¬2.4 billion fine for anti-competitive promotion of its Shopping service. Google was leveraging its dominant position on the market for general search services to favour its own comparison shopping service, presenting search results with attractive visual information while relegating competitors to basic links. The pattern is clear: Google has accumulated penalty exposure of more than 8 billion euros by the EU for various antitrust violations. This isn't just about one caseâit's systematic regulatory pushback against Google's market practices. What makes Europe's approach revolutionary is its shift from traditional antitrust thinking. Unlike previous cases that focused on consumer harm through higher prices, the EU's Digital Markets Act targets "gatekeeper behavior" that stifles innovation and choice. In the Shopping case, the court found that Google's conduct was discriminatory and did not fall within the scope of competition on the merits. Translation: Google wasn't winning because it was betterâit was winning by rigging the game, and that's enough for enforcement action regardless of immediate consumer impact. The stakes couldn't be higher. The remedies trial will decide whether Google must divest its ad tech assets or adopt behavioral changes, with the U.S. Department of Justice's antitrust showdown with Google entering its final phase this fall. Google isn't going down without a fight. The company has opposed the breakup, warning of 'seismic disruptions' to its ad tech ecosystem and proposes behavioral adjustments, such as ending UPR and sharing bid data with competitors. But UBS warned in 2025 that a forced breakup of Google's ad-tech business could trigger a 30% stock plunge. The ripple effects extend far beyond Google. A breakup could create opportunities for rivals like Meta, TikTok, and independent ad tech firms, while the case mirrors EU antitrust actions against Google and could influence ongoing U.S. cases targeting Amazon and Meta. Here's what makes Google's predicament particularly challenging: the company has already tried to make concessions, proposing alternative billing options and even considering partial divestitures to appease European regulators. But publishers rejected the proposal, viewing these measures as insufficient half-steps that fail to address the fundamental structural problems. With the Biden and Trump administrations both supporting this case, there's rare bipartisan consensus that meaningful action is requiredâmaking it nearly impossible for Google to wait out the regulatory storm. Bottom line: We're witnessing the end of Big Tech's regulatory free pass. The Biden and Trump administrations both have supported this case, showing rare bipartisan cooperation in prosecuting tech monopolies. The current batch of significant antitrust cases working through the courts could eventually provide the U.S. Supreme Court an opportunity to reshape antitrust jurisprudence for the digital era. Google's $3.5 billion fine isn't just a penaltyâit's a signal that the era of unchecked tech dominance is ending. With global antitrust enforcement reaching unprecedented levels and regulators worldwide coordinating their efforts, the question isn't whether Google will face more consequences, but how dramatically the entire tech landscape will reshape in response. What makes this regulatory moment truly unprecedented is the coordinated international response. European, American, and other regulators are no longer working in isolationâthey're sharing intelligence, coordinating enforcement strategies, and learning from each other's legal frameworks. This makes it impossible for tech giants to play regulatory arbitrage or simply absorb fines as a cost of doing business. When the EU develops new approaches like the Digital Markets Act's "gatekeeper" framework, U.S. courts take notice, creating a global convergence toward tougher tech oversight. The implications cascade beyond Google to the entire interconnected web of Big Tech dominance. Apple faces its own antitrust challenges, Meta confronts divestiture demands around Instagram and WhatsApp, and Amazon faces scrutiny over its treatment of third-party sellers. Unlike previous enforcement efforts that tackled companies in isolation, regulators now understand how these platforms reinforce each other's market power and are addressing the ecosystem systematically. For users, developers, and competitors who've been squeezed by Google's dominance, this regulatory reckoning might finally level the playing field. If these enforcement actions deliver on their promise, we could see genuine choice in search engines, real competition in digital advertising, and innovation from companies that no longer face impossible barriers to entry. The real test will be whether these legal victories translate into tangible changes in how we experience and interact with digital platforms. The era of "move fast and break things" is over.

Title: Using The Blog Module vs Divi 5’s Loop Builder

Posted on September 5, 2025 by Christopher Morris Leave a Comment The Blog Module is Divi’s built-in feed generator that works out of the box. It gives you a fast way to list posts with toggles for titles, images, excerpts, and metadata. Divi 5’s new Loop Builder takes a different approach. You design the item with any modules, then feed dynamic content into it. Both tools display looped content, yet each shines in different scenarios. Knowing when to use which saves time and prevents frustration. Let’s compare the two. Subscribe To Our Youtube Channel This is a short set of terms for beginners who are new to the concept of a Loop Builder: If you get lost in some of the details, refer back to this glossary. But we’ll make things simple for you along the way. The Blog Module is built for recognizable blog patterns. It assumes common elements and lets you toggle what shows, keeping setup fast and decisions simple. Think about how blog posts work in WordPress. Every post shares certain common elements that make it recognizable as blog content. These shared characteristics include: The Blog Module was designed with traditional posts in mind. Titles tell you what the post covers. Featured images add visual draw. Excerpts preview the content. Metadata says who wrote it and when. Divi’s Blog Module syncs to these elements automatically. You drop it on the page and pick what to show. The feed appears with no custom query work at all (unless you want to limit what’s being shown, in which case there are built-in querying tools). The toggle approach makes changes painless. You can hide the author but keep the date, show the image, or skip the excerpt. Small decisions yield quick results. The Blog Module can display normal posts and properly register Custom Post Types. The Blog Module works fine when the CPT mirrors standard post fields. It becomes limiting when you need true custom data. So, a Team Member CPT works when things are kept simple. The Blog Module handles this situation with ease. Limitations appear with any fields that default posts don’t share. Social links, certifications, or years of experience won’t appear in the Blog Module because it was built for the standard fields found on default WordPress blog posts. The module has no toggle for those custom fields. Layout control is also slightly constrained; the module packs elements inside a fixed structure in a fixed order. You can’t reorder the title and image unless you use custom CSS. You can manage the layout of each blog card via flexbox or block, but child items (the cards) don’t have Sizing settings for child flexbox control (like shrink to fit or grow to fill). ﻿ The Blog Module is excellent and fast to use for standard card layouts. If you get a bit of a creative bug, you might find yourself looking for something more custom. Divi’s Loop Builder offers you a different approach to displaying dynamic content. Instead of working within the constraints of a single module with predetermined elements, Loop Builder allows you to construct your content display from individual Divi Modules arranged exactly as you envision them. Using the Loop Builder requires more thought and preparation, but you won’t be limited in the ways you were with the Blog Module. With the Blog Module, you work within existing constraints and make the best of predetermined options. With Loop Builder, you start with a blank canvas and construct exactly what you need using any combination of Divi Modules. Loop Builder is not a single module. It is a container with your chosen modules inside it. When the container is set to “Loop,” it repeats itself for each matching result. Inside the container, you can place Image, Heading, Text, and Button modules. You bind the content of each of those modules to the correct token. Divi’s UI makes this pretty simple. The Image points to the featured image. The Heading points to the title. The Button links to the post URL. This modular approach gives you structure and spacing control. You can put images above or beside titles. You can also add two text blocks for two custom fields. This way, you can build the card you need, not a card that is pre-configured via a module. Let’s make this concrete with a couple of quick scenarios. We’ll keep the pattern and swap the fields. Let’s use the card design from our previous example and see how it can be adapted using custom post types and custom fields. First, build a custom Loop for standard blog posts. Use the stand Posts ‘post type’ with the standard fields for title, category, publish date, and feature image. Map each to the respective module in your design. These use standard post fields but are arranged in a unique layout. We can do something similar for some simple real estate listings. Using the same card layout, we can populate content from our custom post type with the heading assigned to the property title, Text Modules assigned to bedrooms, bathrooms, and property description, and a Button bound to the property listing URL. The end result looks like our blog card, but uses the Loop Builder’s ability to assign content from Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. All this talk of CPTs, how do you make those? Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) is the go-to choice here. Pods, Meta Box, ACPT, and Toolset also create fields that Loop Builder can read. Use what fits your budget, experience, and stack. A note for real estate websites: You’ll want to use a dedicated plugin that pulls listings from an IDX into WordPress as a CPT. That way, you have fresh data and minimal manual work (no one wants to manually enter properties every morning). Flexbox pairs naturally with the Loop Builder. You can use it at two levels for a clean, responsive structure without custom CSS. First, style the outer loop container. Select the loop parent container. Turn on Flex layout. Set direction to Row. Enable Wrap if you want multiple flex-rows. Set Gap to control spacing between items. Then, adjust the sizing of the child container where your loop sits using the Sizing options. You can create a responsive and attractive layout for your looped elements between the container Flex controls and the child Flex controls. Second, style the inner card layout. Select the root container inside the loop item (the Column or Group Module, for instance). In Layout options, set Flex direction to Row if you want some elements side by side. Set the width of the image module to take up about half the space in the container. Let the text area (in this case, a Group container with various modules inside) fill the rest (Grow to Fill in Group Module Sizing options). You can arrange the various containers or modules however you want. You aren’t locked into a preconfigured layout. Here we put the Title in the left Group and set the right group to Flex Column. This gives us a subtle yet unique change of layout. There really is no shortage of possibilities. ﻿﻿ This is less about raw features and more about finding the right fit. Pick the fastest path that meets the requirement. Switch tools when the need changes. Sometimes the Blog Module will do the trick, but you have a strong pivot with the Loop Builder when it doesn’t. Reach for the Blog Module when content follows standard post patterns. Title, featured image, excerpt, and basic meta are its sweet spot. Basic news sites, company updates, and simple portfolios qualify. Visitors expect a conventional layout, and you may want a reliable solution with minimal setup. With the Blog Module, you can ship a working feed in minutes. Fewer moving parts also mean fewer chances to break things (or get confused). Non-technical users who might still be lost on the concept of a “loop” will still heavily rely on the Blog Module. It’s a great tool and should absolutely be used. Use Loop Builder when you need fields that posts don’t have, or when your card structure doesn’t match a stock pattern. Ecommerce, real estate, and education are typical industries that tend to need more customization. Each needs details that live in custom fields. When you are working with more content or more types of content, layouts tend to need more flexibility. Use Loop Builder when content relationships get complex. You may need to mix post types in one view and show content from repeaters. Divi’s Blog Module is still the fastest way to ship a standard feed. The Loop Builder unlocks custom cards, custom fields, and repeaters. The Loop Builder can also be customized and molded into the exact layout and design that you have in mind, while the Blog Module has some limitations there. The best part about this decision is that you can keep both in your toolkit and choose based on the job. Divi 5 is coming together and is more powerful (and stable) than ever.

Title: What’s up with… Ciena, Telecom Italia, Starlink in India
URL: https://www.telecomtv.com/content/access-evolution/what-s-up-with-ciena-telecom-italia-starlink-in-india-53773/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T14:47:16Z
Full Content:
Sep 5, 2025 In today’s industry news roundup: Ciena’s on a roll; Telecom Italia’s new largest shareholder is Italy’s state-owned postal service; Elon Musk’s Starlink is prepping for its satellite broadband launch in India; and more! As we reported on Thursday, Ciena is benefitting from the rising investments needed in network capacity as cloud, video and, in particular, AI-related data volumes increase, as it reported a 29.4% year-on-year increase in revenues to $1.22bn for its fiscal third quarter that ended on 2 August. In the company’s earnings presentation, the optical, routing and automation software technology vendor noted that in addition to that stellar growth continuing into its fiscal fourth quarter, it is also set to extend into its fiscal year 2026, which runs (roughly) November 2025 to the end of October 2026. The company expects full year revenues for fiscal 2026 to be 17% higher than in fiscal 2025 (which ends in late October), way higher than the 10% growth that financial analysts had been expecting. That growth is being driven by increasing investments from the hyperscalers, big tech giants/datacentre operators, such as Meta, and major US telcos, such as Verizon, AT&T and Lumen Technologies. Fiscal 2025 full year revenues are set to come in at around $4.7bn, so that puts Ciena’s expectation for its fiscal 2026 sales at $5.5bn. No wonder the vendor’s share price jumped by an incredible 23.3% on Thursday to end the day at $116.92. Italy’s state-owned postal service Poste Italiane has been given unconditional approval by the country’s antitrust authority, the AGCM (Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato), to acquire a 15% stake in national telco Telecom Italia (TIM) from French media giant Vivendi. The deal was first announced in late March. According to Poste Italiane, “the AGCM resolved to approve the transaction unconditionally and, therefore, not to initiate an investigation, as it does not significantly impede effective competition in the affected markets and does not result in the creation or strengthening of a dominant position”. As a result of the purchase, Poste Italiane is now Telecom Italia’s largest single shareholder, with a total stake of 24.81%. In August, Telecom Italia reported revenues of €6.6bn, up 2.7%, for the first six months of the year, and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) up 5% to €1.7bn. Starlink, Elon Musk’s low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellation that is having a major impact on the global broadband services and direct-to-cell (D2C) communications sectors, has received a provisional spectrum licence from India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) so it can trial its satellite broadband services in the country. The New India Express reports that Starlink is setting up ground stations at 10 locations across India as well as a main operations hub in Mumbai. The operator now has to prove it can comply with India’s security rules during a number of tests and trials: If it is successful it will be awarded a full licence, though the DoT noted that full licence pricing and terms are still to be finalised. The expectation, though, is that Starlink will proceed without any major issues and soon become an influential player in India’s broadband services sector, not least because it has already struck partnerships with India’s two largest telcos, Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel. US long-distance operator Lumen Technologies is to use Palantir Technologies’ Foundry and Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) to help transform its business. “Lumen is transforming from traditional telecom into a next-generation technology infrastructure company leveraging its physical fiber network, digitally powered platform and connected ecosystem,” noted Palantir in this announcement. “To meet customers’ evolving multicloud, AI-ready needs, Lumen is collaborating with Palantir across its operations, finance and technology functions to unlock new value. Palantir’s Foundry and AIP aim to streamline workflows, accelerate decision-making, and simplify complex legacy operations – from customer service and compliance reporting to the decommissioning of legacy telecom infrastructure and migration of products into modernised ecosystems. By surfacing actionable insights and enabling AI-assisted decision-making, the software is driving faster execution and improved operational efficiency, empowering Lumen to transform its network and services with speed,” added Palantir. Dave Ward, chief technology and product officer of Lumen Technologies, stated: “As Lumen powers the backbone of the AI economy, we’re determined to make our own operations intelligent and efficient, just like the networks we deliver to our customers. Working with Palantir allows us to harness AI to accelerate our modernisation efforts and deliver the network and services our customers need in the AI era.” – The staff, TelecomTV Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 9, 2025 Sep 8, 2025 Sep 5, 2025 Sign up to receive TelecomTV's top news and videos, plus exclusive subscriber-only content direct to your inbox.

Title: Marvell: MRVL Stock To $140?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/marvell-mrvl-stock-to-140/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T12:35:58Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) has been one of the tech sectors more puzzling stories this year. Despite delivering record second quarter results and showing signs of building a niche for itself in AI infrastructure, the stock has slumped 43% year-to-date - including a 15% slide in the last week - after management issued a cautious outlook for its data center business. Shares now trade at $64 apiece. The sell-off stems from lumpy orders for Marvell’s custom AI accelerators, but such quarterly volatility is fairly common in this market. Delays in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) next-generation AI chips amid design changes could be pushing back demand for Marvell’s silicon, while Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS which relies on Marvell for its Trainium AI chips has been losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Overall, these issues appear more like timing-related volatility than structural problems. Marvell’s long-term opportunity in AI looks compelling, given not just its custom accelerators, but also its optical connectivity chips. Could this underappreciated AI player be set up for a sharp rebound? We outline a case that could see the stock more than double to almost $140 per share from current levels. Separately, see important current market context – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Marvell's Long Growth Runway In AI Marvell’s push into the AI market began with its high-speed interconnect solutions for data centers. These optical and electrical interconnects are essential for moving the enormous volumes of data generated by AI and machine learning workloads. Since these workloads rely on massive parallel processing and ultra-fast data transfer, they place heavy demands on existing infrastructure, creating a need for the advanced connectivity technologies that Marvell provides. The bigger growth driver has been application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for AI. Unlike general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are customized for the requirements of individual customers such as hyperscalers, delivering better cost efficiency, lower power consumption, and superior performance. This could play to Marvell’s advantage in the long-run. Big tech is in the middle of an unprecedented AI spending spree. Amazon is expected to spend up to $105 billion on capex in 2025, while Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta are forecast to spend as much as $80 billion, $75 billion, and $72 billion respectively, much of it earmarked for AI infrastructure such as GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). However, investors will eventually begin to prioritize returns on AI investments and companies could become more judicious with spending. Big companies could seek alternatives to Nvidia, and Marvell’s specialized models could be a top choice for hyperscalers. Also see: What’s happening with SMCI stock? There are signs that the most compute-intensive phase of AI training may begin to level off, with the industry’s focus shifting toward inference - the application of trained models to new data in real time and at massive scale. Inference is lighter per task but occurs continuously across millions of users and applications. This transition plays directly into Marvell’s strengths, as it opens the door for specialized, power-efficient solutions beyond the high-end GPUs that dominate training. The market could potentially shift from large-scale general-purpose AI models to smaller, specialized ones, potentially helping more niche players like Marvell who offer tailored products that optimize costs and performance for specific applications. The 2x Math Coming back to the stock's potential, the math works like this. Marvell trades at about 40x trailing earnings and about 23x estimated FY'26 adjusted earnings. This is well below peers such as AMD and Nvidia. AMD trades at about 40x forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at about 38x. This indicates that Marvell’s multiple is not stretched. Revenue Growth: Marvell Technology has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 10.9% over the last 3 years, but this does not capture the big AI surge the company is witnessing. Over the most recent quarter, net revenue came in at a record $2.0 billion, up 58% compared to the same period last year. Marvell revenue stood at about $5.77 billion in FY'25 and the metric is likely to grow by about 41% to $8.14 billion per consensus estimates. Looking ahead, if revenues expand at an average rate of 30% each year over FY'27 and FY'28, driven by AI demand, Marvell's top line could scale to about $13.7 billion by FY'28. Adjusted margins: Coming to margins, Non-GAAP net income was $585.5 million, or $0.67 per diluted share. Adjusted net margins stood at 28% over the first six months of the year. As scale improves and fixed costs are absorbed, margins are expected to gradually move higher. For perspective, Nvidia now posts margins of over 50%. If Marvell’s adjusted net margins rise to about 30%, this would translate into adjusted net income of over $4.1 billion, roughly 3x FY'25 numbers. Earnings multiple: Now if income rises so much, the trailing multiple, which stands at about 40x would fall to a third of its value or about 13x, right? Probably not. As Marvell scales up its business profitably, investors might continue to assign a high multiple of about 30x, about 25% below current levels. This would translate into a market cap of roughly $120 billion, or a little over 2x from current levels. See MRVL Valuation Ratios What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or three - as long as MRVL sustains its revenue expansion trajectory and steadily improves margins, the stock price could respond similarly. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: American Bitcoin, Backed By Trump, Ends Nasdaq Debut Up 17%

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. American Bitcoin, a mining company tied to US President Donald Trump’s sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., wrapped up its first day of trading on the Nasdaq with sharp swings but still managed to finish 16.75% higher at just over $8. After-hours trading pushed the stock up another 6% to $8.50, reports confirmed. Trading opened with a rush. The newly rebranded company, formed through a merger with Gryphon Digital Mining (GRYP), jumped as high as $13.21 from Gryphon’s previous close of $6.90, a 90% surge. That early momentum collapsed quickly, sending the stock down to $6.70 in the afternoon before it recovered part of the loss. Nasdaq halted trading five times due to extreme volatility. Despite the erratic moves, Bloomberg estimated Eric Trump’s 7.5% stake at roughly $548 million by the end of the session. His fortune is now tied directly to how American Bitcoin performs in the market. According to Eric Trump, the company will not only mine Bitcoin but also buy it when conditions make more sense. He described the approach as switching “to whichever is better at the time.” The company’s existing treasury already holds 2,443 BTC, making it the 25th-largest stash among public companies. With Bitcoin trading above $112,000, that holding is worth about $275 million. Eric Trump emphasized that the business will aim to maximize shareholder value by balancing mining output and market purchases: “We’re going to harness daily mining to the fullest, but we can also go out and purchase Bitcoin to support the treasury,” the presidential son said. The launch has stirred questions about whether American Bitcoin benefits from President Trump’s crypto-friendly stance. Eric Trump dismissed criticism that his family is profiting directly from political ties, saying his father has “nothing to do with this business.” The American Bitcoin debut came just days after another Trump-linked venture. Tokens for World Liberty Financial (WLFI), a separate crypto project involving President Trump and his sons, were listed on exchanges earlier in the week. WLFI’s performance has so far been weak, dropping 30% from its debut price and losing another 7% in the last 24 hours to about 21 cents, based on CoinMarketCap data. A company tied to the Trumps owns nearly a quarter of all WLFI tokens, estimated at $4.6 billion in value. While WLFI struggles to gain traction, American Bitcoin’s opening has given the Trump family another high-profile position in the crypto sector. Whether the stock can maintain its momentum after a chaotic debut remains uncertain, but Eric Trump called the launch “an unbelievable day” and insisted “the floodgates are just starting to open.” Featured image from Meta, chart from TradingView They say journalists never truly clock out.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: AI stock euphoria: Is this another 2000 dot-com bust in the making?

'Making Money' host Charles Payne discusses what's causing the market to pull back. If you were investing in the late 1990s, you’ll remember the euphoria of the dot-com boom. Anything with a ".com" at the end of its name could raise millions in capital and see its stock price double or triple overnight. Investors believed the internet would change everything – which, to be fair, it eventually did. But between 2000 and 2002, that dream turned into a nightmare when the Nasdaq lost nearly 80% of its value, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Today, with artificial intelligence leading headlines and fueling investor enthusiasm, many people are wondering if we are about to experience another dot-com bust? AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. ( / iStock) The Parallels to the Late ’90s There are some undeniable similarities between the two periods. Back then, internet companies with little more than a business plan and a website were valued at astronomical levels. Today, AI feels like the new internet – a transformative technology that promises to upend industries from healthcare to finance to entertainment. The narrative is powerful, and capital is rushing in. Recently, Palantir which is a fan favorite stock right now, traded with a PE of 522! TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA Another similarity is market concentration. In 1999, Cisco, Intel, Sun Microsystems and AOL were the poster children of the boom. Fast-forward to today, and the so-called "Magnificent 7" – Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia – make up more than 30% of the entire S&P 500. To put that in perspective, the S&P 500 is supposed to be a diversified index of America’s top companies. But if just a handful of stocks are driving most of the returns, that creates real risks if those companies stumble. The market capitalization of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks is almost 40% of the entire S&P 500 Index. The Differences That Matter While the echoes of the dot-com era are loud, the differences are even louder. UBS managing director and senior portfolio manager Jason Katz weighs in on artificial intelligence in the U.S. markets and cryptocurrencies' performance in the stock market. First, valuations are stretched but not nearly as absurd as 1999. Back then, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of the S&P 500 was over 25 – an eye-popping figure for the time. Many internet stocks had no earnings at all, making traditional valuation metrics meaningless. WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE Today, the S&P 500’s forward P/E ratio hovers around 21. That’s elevated compared to the long-term average of 15-16, but nowhere near dot-com territory. And crucially, the tech giants dominating today’s index are highly profitable businesses generating enormous cash flow. The only area where we see these dot-com patterns popping up are in AI stocks. Slap the two letters AI next to a stock and it’s a feeding frenzy for investors. Second, the companies leading the charge aren’t speculative startups with unproven business models. Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet are trillion-dollar companies with fortress balance sheets and decades of consistent profitability. Nvidia – the crown jewel of the AI trade – sells real products with extraordinary demand. Unlike Pets.com, Webvan.com and eToys (remember them?), these firms have sustainable revenue streams and durable competitive advantages. Is AI the New Dot-Com? There’s no doubt that AI feels frothy. Just as investors in the late 1990s believed every business would be transformed by the internet, many now believe AI will reshape every corner of the economy. Some of this optimism is justified. Essex Investment Management CO-CEO Nancy Prial reveals the factors that are driving market breadth improvement on 'Making Money.' GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The internet did change the way we live our lives today. AI has the potential to boost productivity, reduce costs and create entirely new industries. But in the short term, markets almost always overestimate the speed of adoption and AI companies start up so fast that many are bound to fail. That’s where the risk lies: not in whether AI will change the world, but in how quickly investors think it will happen. History tells us that transformative technologies often go through hype cycles. We thought by now, people wouldn’t still be writing checks but still 50% of Americans wrote at least one check over the past 12 months. There will be winners, but there will also be plenty of losers along the way. Why This Isn’t 2000 Despite the hype, I don’t believe we’re headed for a repeat of the dot-com crash. Here’s why: Fitz-Gerald Group Chief Investment Officer Keith Fitz-Gerald argues Tesla is an A.I. stock and explains why Palantir can hit $100 per share by the end of the year on 'Varney & Co.' CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS Will there be volatility? Absolutely. Some AI-driven stocks are priced for perfection and will correct when reality falls short of expectations. But a wholesale collapse of the market like we saw from 2000 to 2002 is unlikely. The better comparison might be the railroad boom of the 1800s. Railroads transformed the economy, and many companies failed along the way. But the infrastructure they created powered America’s growth for more than a century. AI may follow the same path – messy in the early years, but ultimately world-changing.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:26:13Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

04 September 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Khabarhub brings you a glimpse of major developments of the day in Nepal, including politics, business/economy, sports, entertainment, and more. Nepal directs ISPs to block 26 unregistered social media platforms The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has instructed the Nepal Telecommunications Authority (NTA) to direct Internet service providers (ISPs) to block 26 social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, including Facebook. NTA Executive Director Min Prasad Aryal confirmed that ISPs have already received instructions to implement the ban. The decision follows the government’s directive that all social media platforms must complete registration under the Social Media Use Directive, within the timeframe set by the cabinet. These are the apps govt is blocking for not registering The government is enforcing its decision to block all social media platforms that have not completed official registration, effective immediately. This move follows a Supreme Court order and a recent ministerial meeting led by Communications Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung. Currently, only five platforms have completed registration and are allowed to operate in Nepal. These include TikTok, Viber, Nimbuzz, WeTalk, and Opolive. Platforms still in the process of registration, such as Telegram and Global Link, are temporarily permitted to operate. Meta reaches out to government over listing; Hamro Patro submits application Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has reached out to the government of Nepal regarding the mandatory listing of social media platforms. According to Information Ministry spokesperson Gajendra Thakur, Meta representatives contacted the ministry’s secretariat to inquire about the required procedures and documents for listing. Seven provisions behind Nepal’s social media ban The government has said it will start blocking social media platforms that have not completed official registration, citing seven specific provisions under the Social Media Use Directive. The move follows a Supreme Court order requiring platforms to register before operating in Nepal. The government had issued a seven-day deadline starting August 28 for platforms to complete registration, but foreign-based operators failed to comply. With the deadline expired, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, in consultation with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, initiated the ban. Leaders criticize government’s decision to block social media The government’s decision to block 26 social media platforms, including unregistered Facebook, has drawn sharp criticism from political leaders. Nepali Congress General Secretary Gagan Kumar Thapa called the move “a step in the wrong direction.” He said the Supreme Court had directed the government to make laws for regulation, not impose blanket bans. “The government has taken a reverse course. This must be reconsidered,” he said. Thapa added that social media is vital for freedom of expression, public debate, and government accountability. Maoist Centre to launch protests against government after Dashain-Tihar The main opposition, CPN (Maoist Centre), has decided to initiate protests against the government after the Dashain and Tihar festivals. Spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota said the office-bearers’ meeting held at the party headquarters in Parisdanda on Thursday concluded that corruption is on the rise and governance has weakened, prompting the need for protest. He added that the party would use street demonstrations to raise public awareness about democratic republican socialism and the socialist-oriented system envisioned in the constitution. PM Oli’s India visit uncertain, says Indian media Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is reportedly unlikely to visit India, according to an Indian news outlet. The Print Online cited sources suggesting that Oli’s planned visit on September 15 may not take place. The report comes shortly after a brief meeting between PM Modi and PM Oli on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit in Tianjin, China, earlier this week. FNJ protests government decision to block social media The Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has opposed the government’s decision to shut down unregistered social media platforms. In a statement issued on Thursday, FNJ General Secretary Ram Prasad Dahal said the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology’s decision to restrict unlisted platforms would curtail press freedom and freedom of expression. Ram Hari Khatiwada files candidacy for chair of Parliamentary Hearing Committee Nepali Congress lawmaker Ram Hari Khatiwada has filed his candidacy for the post of chairperson of the Parliamentary Hearing Committee. He registered his nomination on Thursday following his party’s recommendation. Karn Thapa registers dissent ahead of UML’s statute convention CPN-UML Standing Committee member Karn Bahadur Thapa has officially registered his dissenting opinion at the party’s central office ahead of the second statute convention, set to begin on Friday. “I am at the party’s central office to formally register my dissent,” Thapa said on Thursday. “Once registered, I will make my dissent public. This is meant to contribute to internal party debate.” Parliamentary committee expresses dissatisfaction over new parliament building construction A parliamentary committee has expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of construction work on the new Parliament building, which is still under construction. On Thursday, the Committee on Monitoring and Evaluation of the Implementation of Directive Principles, Policies, and Responsibilities of the State, under the Federal Parliament, carried out a surprise inspection of the project. The committee remarked that the construction progress was far behind schedule. Embossed number plates essential for Digital Nepal: Transport Nepal Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Devendra Dahal has emphasized that embossed number plates on vehicles are necessary to advance the government’s Digital Nepal initiative. Speaking in the House of Representatives on Thursday, Minister Dahal explained that agreements for installing embossed plates had been signed three times in the past, and failing to implement them would require the government to pay Rs 3 billion to manufacturers without receiving any production. He clarified that the current government was merely implementing previous agreements. NEPSE dips by 6.55 points The Nepal stock market slipped by 6.55 points on Thursday, with the NEPSE index closing at 2,719.77. Before the weighted average calculation, the market was down by less than one point, but it fell by six points after the official tally. Trading volume increased compared to the previous day, reaching Rs 5.14 billion, up from Rs 4.72 billion. Among listed companies, 85 saw their share prices rise, 165 declined, and one remained unchanged. India enforces new India clarifies entry rules for Nepalis as new Immigration Act comes into effectimmigration rules The Government of India has introduced new immigration regulations under the Immigration and Foreigners Act 2025, effective from September 1, according to the Times of India. The Act grants expanded powers to the Bureau of Immigration (BOI), with the aim of curbing fraud, assisting state authorities in deporting illegal immigrants, and establishing a centralized immigration database. Inactive social media platforms to be reactivated once registered: Communication Ministry The government has decided to deactivate social media platforms operating in Nepal without official registration, according to a notice issued by the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Thursday. The ministry stated that the move follows a Supreme Court order requiring both domestic and foreign online and social media platforms to undergo mandatory registration before operation in Nepal. Bhandari’s membership row is not an internal party dispute: Shankar Pokharel CPN-UML General Secretary Shankar Pokharel has said that the issue of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari’s party membership should not be viewed as an internal dispute within UML but rather as a clash between her aspiration to reclaim membership and the party’s institutional decision. Speaking ahead of the second statute convention, which begins tomorrow in Godavari, Pokharel said the matter has been amplified outside the party even though it is essentially about setting a new precedent. Thapa cleared by EC to contest Rupandehi-3 by-election The candidacy of Dr. Lekh Jung Thapa, fielded by the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) for the upcoming Rupandehi-3 by-election, has sparked a wave of debate on social media. The discussion emerged after social media users cited a provision mentioned in a press release issued by Election Commission spokesperson and Joint Secretary Nita Pokharel Aryal on July 20. The provision states that individuals whose names remain on the closed list of proportional representation (PR) candidates from the 2022 federal and provincial elections cannot contest in upcoming polls. Nepali garment industries creating thousands of jobs: Minister Bhandari Minister for Industry, Commerce and Supplies Damodar Bhandari has said that Nepal’s garment industries are creating employment opportunities for thousands of people while contributing significantly to the country’s economic development. Speaking at the inauguration of the 30th Annual General Assembly of the Nepal Garment Association on Wednesday, Minister Bhandari noted that the sector has played a vital role in generating jobs and earning foreign currency for the nation. RSP’s public affairs secretary Badan Bhandari attacked in Kathmandu Badan Bhandari, Secretary of the Public Affairs Department of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was attacked late last night in Pragati Chowk, Kapan, according to party officials. RSP Chair Rabi Lamichhane’s aide Pramod Nyaupane said three assailants on a motorcycle with its number plate concealed carried out the attack. Two of them struck Bhandari with iron rods, while the third was carrying a khukuri. Gold and silver prices unchanged The price of gold has remained unchanged on Thursday. According to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association, the price of gold is Rs 207,900 per tola. RPP demands PM Oli’s clarification on reported agreement with China’s GSI The Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP) has demanded that Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli clarify reports that Nepal has agreed to join China’s Global Security Initiative (GSI). Speaking during the zero hour of the House of Representatives meeting on Thursday, RPP General Secretary Dr. Dhawal Shumsher Rana sought an explanation from the Prime Minister on behalf of his party. Indra Jatra commences in Kathmandu The Indra Jatra festival has begun in Kathmandu Valley today. Celebrated to worship Indra, the god of rain and cooperation, the festival is also known as Yenya Punhi among the Newar community. The festivities kicked off at Hanuman Dhoka with the erection of the Indra Dhwaja pole at 10:31 am. The eight-day celebration includes traditional dances, chariot processions, and rituals honoring various deities.

Title: 20VC + SaaStr is Back With Canva Founder Cliff Obrecht: Anthropic’s $13B Round, OpenAI’s $1.1B Statsig Acquisition & Why Public SaaS Is Back From The Dead

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts, Scale We’re back on 20VC+SaaStr, and its a great one as Canva Co-Founder and COO Cliff Obrecht joins Harry, Rory and Jason for a deep dive into this week’s biggest venture deals, AI infrastructure spending, and the return of public SaaS valuations. And why Canva won’t direct list. Cliff Obrecht (Canva COO): “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate. We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” Jason Lemkin (SaaStr): “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025 — you kind of failed as a founder because you have no excuse. You had 18 months.” Rory O’Driscoll (Scale Venture Partners): “Even if Anthropic goes from $9B ARR to $30B (3x growth down from 10x), that’s 8x next year’s revenues. High absolute number? Absolutely. Does it make sense if the growth persists? It’s not crazy.” Harry Stebbings (20VC): “Most VCs should have had Anthropic’s trajectory in their model 47 days ago. These companies are out-accelerating plan, but you’re always valuing future growth.” Anthropic’s latest funding round grabbed headlines not just for its size — $13 billion at a $183 billion post-money valuation — but for what the math reveals about AI company valuations when you dig deeper. “I went into the analysis expecting to say ‘aren’t those guys so silly paying so much?'” admits Rory O’Driscoll. “But when you look at the numbers, maybe those guys are being quite smart.” The trajectory is staggering: from $100 million two years ago to a $1 billion run rate at the start of this year, now approaching $8-9 billion by year-end. If accurate, this represents roughly 9x revenue growth in a single year. O’Driscoll’s forward-looking analysis reveals why investors were fighting to get in: “Even if they decelerate from 10x to 3x growth next year — going from $9B to $30B ARR — the average revenue would be around $20B. That’s 8x next year’s revenues if the growth persists.” The round was massively oversubscribed, with demand reportedly 5-10x the amount raised. For growth-stage investors, sitting out seemed impossible. “If you’re a growth stage investor, it’s hard to imagine a world where you say ‘well, we’re growth stage investors but the two largest market cap companies in the last 3-5 years are the two LLM models and we don’t have a piece of that,'” notes O’Driscoll. On the same day, OpenAI announced its acquisition of Statsig for $1.1 billion in stock — exactly matching the company’s last funding round valuation from Iconic Ventures. With Statsig generating $75 million ARR, the deal represents roughly 15x revenue multiple. The acquisition makes strategic sense beyond the numbers. Statsig’s CEO now ranks as #3 at OpenAI, and with Figma’s CEO joining OpenAI’s leadership, the company is assembling serious product talent. “The fact that it was exactly the price of the last round shows this was something that everyone wanted to roll into,” observes O’Driscoll. For Iconic, which led Anthropic’s previous round and was blocked from OpenAI’s direct investment, this provided a backdoor into the OpenAI ecosystem. Public SaaS companies delivered a surprise comeback this quarter, with Snowflake leading the charge with a 45% stock jump after reporting 24% year-over-year growth — a significant reacceleration from previous quarters. “It’s the Mark Twain reports of my debt were greatly exaggerated,” quips Rory. “Well, it turns out reports of the death of SaaS and software were greatly exaggerated.” The winners weren’t universal — MongoDB, Box, Elastic, Okta, and Zoom all posted strong results, while others like Salesforce haven’t yet seen the AI benefit flow through to revenue. “Some folks, about half of the public B2B leaders, are finally getting an AI tailwind,” says Lemkin. “Box should be crushing it because every time I spin up a new AI app, I need like two or three databases.” The market reaction reveals how beaten down expectations had become. When companies like Snowflake delivered even modest beats against lowered expectations, investors responded dramatically. Jensen Huang’s prediction of $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending over the next five years sparked intense debate about whether such capex levels can generate sufficient returns. “Look at $4 trillion — you want a 20% return on equity, you’ve got to be generating $800 billion of profit,” calculates O’Driscoll. “That’s a lot of profit when Facebook and Meta combined make a couple hundred billion a year. You’ve got to believe you’re going to create another four Microsofts, another four Facebooks to justify that kind of spend.” The discussion revealed how AI costs are already impacting SaaS margins. Notion famously went from 90% to 80% gross margins, effectively paying a 10% “GPU tax” on their revenue. Canva’s Obrecht confirmed similar impacts: “100% yes, it already is [10% of revenue]. If you look at Lovable, their pass-through to Anthropic or model providers will be way more than 10%.” However, Obrecht expects optimization over time: “We’re betting on distilling these models down, understanding user queries and where I need the frontier model versus where I can deploy the model that’s on-device or self-hosted. Companies will get better at picking the right model for the right job.” Obrecht provided rare insights into Canva’s current trajectory and IPO preparations. The company will close the year “very close if not at $4 billion” in revenue, growing at nearly 40% and reaccelerating. “We have a lot of long-term partners and you want to pay loyalty to people that have supported you along the way, but we’re also thinking through what an IPO looks like,” Obrecht explained about their current secondary round approach. With over a billion in cash and eight years of profitability, Canva doesn’t need primary capital. The challenge became managing a supply-demand imbalance when employees wanted to sell after seeing Figma’s public debut. On timing, Obrecht noted: “We’re gearing up to be an IPO ready company. When we actually go out is another question, but we want to be ready.” The company faces the classic late-stage private company dilemma. “What is the real difference?” asks Obrecht about staying private versus going public. “As a late stage private company with all the big institutions already invested and continuing to do so, our reporting obligations and expectations to beat and raise are pretty much the same.” Obrecht was candid about the limitations of private market liquidity solutions: “There’s availability to capital which we have access to. I think it’s probably liquidity and there are restrictions particularly around employee liquidity and what you can do in the US and whatnot around that piece.” The 13-year-old company recognizes the fairness issue: “We’re 13 years old as a company. Our employees should have liquidity. They’ve created all this value. How can we make it easy for them to access that wealth that’s built up?” But secondary markets aren’t a perfect substitute for public liquidity: “While secondaries, annual secondaries are a mechanism for that, it’s pretty janky and particularly in some jurisdictions, it’s downright impossible.” This creates the awkward dynamic where employees need permission from their employer to access liquidity they’ve earned through years of value creation. “Having to get permission from your employer to get liquidity as a secondary after 13 years — it’s better than no liquidity but it’s a little bit serf-like,” notes one participant. “When you’re public you can make your own choices.” Canva’s AI integration offers a window into how established SaaS companies are navigating the transition. “AI is just accelerating [our mission] massively, making it quicker, faster, and better for customers to achieve their goals,” says Obrecht. The company is moving to a unified credit model for AI features, with free users getting limited credits, premium subscribers getting more, and heavy users paying usage-based pricing beyond certain thresholds. “We’ve got 240 million users. We’re about to launch in October a whole slew of new AI products deeply integrating it into every part of the workflow. We need to seriously run the math on if 20%, 50%, 80% of our users use this 10 times a month — the costs can look pretty big and eat into margins very significantly.” The conversation revealed fascinating insights about venture capital psychology around “the ones that got away.” Multiple participants shared examples of passing on companies early, then struggling to invest at higher valuations later. “Many of my most successful deals I’ve passed on prior,” admits O’Driscoll. “When you see the company say they’ll do A, B, and C, you pass because you don’t believe they’ll do A, B, and C, and then they do A, B, and even C prime — you have what you need to know.” The key insight: “The difference in information content between two data points over time, both of which are positive, and one data point where you have no calibration is almost infinite.” Obrecht observed this pattern with Canva investors: “The best investors that have done best out of Canva were early stage funds, but they realized ‘Holy shit, we’re onto something here.’ So they raised SPVs or additional vehicles to move further up the value chain, going later and later stage and compounded their position.” 1. AI Valuations Aren’t As Crazy As They Look Forward revenue multiples for companies like Anthropic become reasonable when you factor in sustained hypergrowth trajectories. 2. Public SaaS Is Back, But Selectively. Companies with distribution advantages and AI integration are seeing real reacceleration (Snowflake, Datadog, Box, Okta, GitLab even Zoom), while others remain stuck. 3. The 10% GPU Tax Is Real SaaS companies are already spending 10%+ of revenue on AI inference, but optimization will bring costs down over time. 4. Private-to-Public Arbitrage Exists Again Public markets are now valuing companies higher than late-stage private markets in many cases. 5. Don’t Let Pride Stop Follow-On Investments The biggest VC returns often come from doubling down on companies you initially passed on after seeing execution. “If Zuck’s not feeling great about his AI strategy, he can cry into his $200 billion and get over it on his own, right? Take it up with a therapist.” — Rory O’Driscoll on Zuck’s Meta challenges “We’ve had a billion sitting on our balance sheet for ages — that’s a flex, people.” — Cliff Obrecht on Canva’s financial position “Wall Street is the madman in the back seat. In the end, the thing that bails out our incompetence is your growth rate.” — Cliff Obrecht on market volatility vs execution “If you have a billion dollar installed base, you have a distribution channel. It’s kind of sinful if you haven’t reaccelerated by the end of 2025.” — Jason Lemkin on AI tailwinds for established SaaS companies “It’s a bit embarrassing as an early stage investor to buy Revolut off Goldman Sachs. That’s when you really fuck up as an early stage investor.” — Harry Stebbings on VC regret psychology Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

US stocks bounced back on Thursday as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rebounded after days of losses, lifted by weaker-than-expected jobs data that fueled fresh hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The move came as investors also tracked Salesforce’s steep drop, American Eagle’s surprise rally, and Stephen Miran’s Fed confirmation hearing, keeping both Wall Street and Washington in sharp focus.

This “compensation actually paid”—a metric that takes into account not just salary but also the amount by which stock holdings increase—made Karp, by a large margin, the highest-paid CEO in the United States. For anyone paying attention to Palantir’s recent fortunes, this was no great surprise. The stock value of the company—whose revenue comes largely from government contracts for data surveillance and the military application of artificial intelligence—is, one might say, negatively indexed to the peace and freedom of humanity. Over the past year the company’s stock has increased in value by a factor of almost six. At the time of writing Palantir was worth $375 billion, making it the twenty-second most valuable company in the S&P 500—just ahead of Coca-Cola and behind Bank of America. “Bad times,” as Karp put it in a recent CNBC appearance, “are incredibly good for Palantir.” And the times, of course, have been incredibly bad. Russia’s long and brutal war of imperial aggression in Ukraine. Israel’s campaign of mass slaughter and ethnic cleansing in Gaza. The outbreak of a larger war in the Middle East (now in a fragile détente) amid expressions of enthusiasm for a violent overthrow of the Iranian leadership. In the US an unprecedented campaign of deportations, leading to civil unrest in Los Angeles and elsewhere. And in all of these situations, there is a great deal of money to be made by a company providing data surveillance and AI systems for military use. The most vivid illustration of this dynamic I have seen is a meme posted to r/PLTR, Reddit’s “unofficial, independent community for retail investors of PLTR to chat about the company, its mission, Alex Karp, and all things pertaining to the stock.” In the background of a photograph taken in a deli or fast-food restaurant, we see a cluster of men involved in a chaotic physical altercation, while in the foreground a middle-aged man sits at a table, entirely unbothered, absorbed in his smartphone. The fighting men are labeled “EUROPE,” “USA,” “ISRAEL,” and “IRAN,” while over the man in the foreground are the words “ME CHECKING THE PRICE OF PALANTIR.” Cofounded in 2003 by Karp and his Stanford friend Peter Thiel, who had recently made serious money from the sale of PayPal to eBay, Palantir Technologies was conceived, in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, as a provider of machine learning and data analytics for the purposes of national security and surveillance. The reasoning went like this: if the US government had been able, in September 2001, to collate and analyze disparate data points—flight school enrollments, anomalies in travel patterns, suspicious associations—the Twin Towers might still be standing, and the people who died that day might still be alive. Palantir’s software facilitates the finding of patterns in large datasets, and presents such information in easily searchable and navigable form. In a recent conversation with Maureen Dowd for The New York Times, which introduced Karp to the paper’s readers as a “billionaire man of mystery,” he described the work his company does as “the finding of hidden things.” (Karp has been a beneficiary of a near uniformly credulous media, and not just in his native country: in 2016 the German daily Die Welt ran a story about him whose headline translates as “This Genius Is Building the Most Important Company in the World.” Karp, it’s worth pointing out, formerly served on the board of directors of the Axel Springer publishing group, Die Welt’s parent company.) Thiel, a Tolkien obsessive of long standing, named the company after the palantíri in The Lord of the Rings—the “far-seeing stones,” one of which was used by the dark lord Sauron to surveil, from his seat of power in Mordor, the inhabitants of Middle Earth. Palantir’s critics, though, are less inclined to invoke Tolkien than they are Philip K. Dick, whose short story “The Minority Report” concerns an authoritarian future society in which “precrime” detectives arrest people for crimes they have not yet carried out but merely formed the intention of committing. Here’s how Karp put it in an interview with Charlie Rose in 2009: “What we do is we use what legal scholars call predicate-based search. So we would look at you, and then we would go out and say, oh, there’s lots of different things in your life that may be indicative of someone involved in bad behavior.” Along with Thiel’s initial investment of $30 million, the company received an early cash injection of $2 million from In-Q-Tel, the CIA’s venture capital arm. Although Palantir also works with corporate clients like Walmart and Wendy’s—which uses Palantir’s AI to manage its inventories of burgers and fries—its earliest and most enduringly important clients were state agencies like the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, for whom it acts as an outsourced provider of intelligence gathering and analytics. During the first Trump term, Palantir became strongly associated with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), providing it with surveillance and deportation logistics. Palantir’s FALCON software helped ICE collate and analyze vast amounts of data to map family connections and plan future raids. In 2018 ICE used FALCON to prepare for raids on around a hundred 7-Eleven stores across the US. Advertisement In October 2023, in the days after the attacks by Hamas on Israeli territory, Palantir took out a full-page ad in The New York Times that read, “Palantir stands with Israel.” The following January, by which time the Israeli government’s genocidal response to those attacks had been underway for three months, the company’s board of directors gathered in Tel Aviv. While there, Karp and Thiel met with Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, and subsequently signed a contract with the country’s defense ministry to provide the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with AI for advanced targeting capabilities. (In discussing this technology, Karp has used the phrase kill chain, a military term of art that refers to the structure of an attack—the identification of a target, the dispatching of military force to its location, and the assault on and destruction of that target.) The company’s share price began to rise vertiginously. “Hamas really took us to the moon,” as one characteristically elated r/PLTR poster put it. Karp’s personal wealth and his public ebullience rose with it. In February of this year, by which time Palantir’s market value had surpassed that of the Walt Disney Company, Karp appeared in an online video call with retail investors. Dressed in a white T-shirt, Karp delivered an apparently ad hoc speech, his arms spread wide in a show of triumphal grandeur and his graying curls bouncing jauntily. “We’re doing it!” he said. We’re doing it! And I’m sure you’re enjoying this as much as I am…. We are crushing it…. We have dedicated our company to the service of the West, and to the United States of America…. Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world, and, when it’s necessary, to scare enemies and on occasion kill them. If Hamas took Palantir shareholders to the moon, the return of Donald Trump to the White House, and the subsequent brief and disastrous reign of Elon Musk, took them to Mars. This April it emerged that ICE was paying the company $30 million to develop a software system, known as ImmigrationOS, to track immigrants using biometric and geolocation data. The second Trump administration has deepened Palantir’s already substantial relationship with the federal government, extending its reach across multiple departments. In March Trump signed an executive order directing the government to share data across agencies, raising concerns, as The New York Times put it, that the president “might compile a master list of personal information on Americans that could give him untold surveillance power,” and that he might use personal information “to advance his political agenda by policing immigrants and punishing critics.” Palantir’s selection as the main partner for this data-sharing project, the Times reported, was driven by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at least three members of which were known to have formerly worked at Palantir. While all this was going on—while he was becoming America’s highest-paid CEO and facilitating a growing police state at home and a genocidal campaign in Gaza—Karp somehow managed to squeeze in writing a book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he managed to dictate one: The Technological Republic, which was published earlier this year, is credited to both Karp and one Nicholas W. Zamiska, Palantir’s head of corporate affairs and legal counsel to the office of the CEO. Speaking with Bari Weiss on her podcast, Karp put it as follows: “I would say, in complete candor, 95 percent plus of the ideas are mine, 90 percent of the writing is his. And the writing is phenomenal.” The writing, I’m sorry to say, is not at all phenomenal; it is uniformly adequate. The division of literary labor, in any case, seems to be such that Karp deployed his own legal counsel in much the same manner as an ordinary person who didn’t want to put in the work might use a generative AI chatbot like ChatGPT, throwing out a mess of half-formed ideas to be put into serviceable prose. Advertisement I don’t wish to unduly diminish the contribution of Zamiska, who for all I know may believe that coauthorship of The Technological Republic redounds to his credit, but it’s bad enough having to read and write about this book without also having to mention both these guys every time I refer to it, so I’m going to take Karp’s lead here and proceed on the understanding that the book is essentially his work. And as I made my way sluggishly through its pages—through its business-casual banalities, its pallid apologias for Western civilization and imperial violence—I found myself increasingly preoccupied by a single question: Why did Alexander Karp want to write this thing in the first place? I suspect that his reasons are at least partly related to the Silicon Valley cult of the tech-founder-as-philosopher-king, and have to do with Karp’s desire to be viewed as not just a businessman but also a public intellectual. This book exists, in other words, in order for Karp to have written a book. Much has been made of his academic and intellectual credentials. He has a doctorate in social theory from Frankfurt’s Goethe Universität. (It has often been noted that while he was there he “studied under” Jürgen Habermas, but that appears to be a stretch; according to Die Welt, he wrote to Habermas asking him to supervise his Ph.D., and Habermas passed him along to a colleague.) He quotes Adorno in his shareholder letters. He plays fast and loose with words like hermeneutics and ontology. On the evidence of The Technological Republic, Habermas, whatever his reasons, made the right call. Its thesis can be outlined briefly enough: Silicon Valley, whose foundational companies were built on defense contracts, has strayed too far, for too long, from its original mission. Its prevailing culture, influenced by the “woke” ideas trickling downward from elite institutions of higher education, is such that building technologies to serve the “national interest” has become almost unthinkable for a generation of talented but misguided engineers. These brilliant minds, argues Karp, are being wasted on lucrative but frivolous projects—on-demand laundry services, apps that can bring you a burrito in a taxi, and so on. “The software industry,” he writes, should rebuild its relationship with government and redirect its effort and attention to constructing the technology and artificial intelligence capabilities that will address the most pressing challenges that we collectively face. The engineering elite of Silicon Valley has an affirmative obligation to participate in the defense of the nation and the articulation of a national project—what is this country, what are our values, and for what do we stand. Karp’s friendship with Thiel is often said to be structured around their ideological differences. Thiel, who supported Trump before it was profitable or popular to do so, is widely viewed as a libertarian. Karp has in the past publicly identified as a progressive and has even occasionally, and absurdly, referred to himself as a “socialist.” But in reality Karp is no more a progressive than Thiel—whose fortune is likewise derived largely from government contracts—is a libertarian. Much of The Technological Republic is given over to the kind of broad-strokes antiwokeism that can be found in dispiriting abundance in the nonfiction section of any airport bookstore. One of the book’s four sections is entitled “The Hollowing Out of the American Mind”—a typically overripe allusion to Allan Bloom’s classic conservative critique of cultural relativism in American higher education, The Closing of the American Mind. Through this long central section, Karp doesn’t elaborate so much as endlessly restate the argument about Silicon Valley having lost the courage of its foundational convictions. (It is often said that many nonfiction books should really have been magazine articles; this one feels like a LinkedIn post mercilessly stretched to nearly three hundred pages.) The book addresses a 2018 controversy around Project Maven, an AI warfare program for which Google was subcontracted by the Pentagon to provide machine learning and data management software. When the staff circulated a petition protesting the company’s involvement in technologies of war, Google discontinued its work on the project. Karp diagnoses a complacency about national security among younger “elites” who did not live through the geopolitical threats of the twentieth century. “The most capable generation of coders,” he writes, “has never experienced a war or genuine social upheaval. Why court controversy with your friends or risk their disapproval by working for the US military when you can retreat into the perceived safety of building another app?” Palantir stepped in to fill the defense-tech gap left by Google’s cowardly decision, a move that Karp implies should be a template for Silicon Valley’s future. He repeatedly claims that coders who want nothing to do with military technology are suffering from moral atrophy. Though they might seem, to you or me, to be acting on principle—because they oppose war in general or have a specific aversion to serving the interests of empire—they are motivated, he insists, not by a higher cause but by the desire to avoid the opprobrium of their peers. Such people, for Karp, are unwitting victims of self-censorship, who won’t even permit themselves to think about offending the prevailing morals: The dystopian future that Orwell and others have imagined may be near, but not because of the surveillance state or contraptions built by Silicon Valley giants that rob us of our privacy or most intimate moments alone. It is we, not our technical creations, who are to blame for failing to encourage and enable the radical act of belief in something above and beyond, and external to, the self. The speed and enthusiasm with which the culture skewers anyone for their perceived transgressions and errors—with which we descend on one another for deviations from the norm—only further diminishes our capacity to move toward truth. The book is filled with this sort of sanctimonious guff. If it were just another denunciation of cancel culture, it would be merely boring and belated. But coming from Alexander Karp, the CEO and cofounder of Palantir Technologies, this concern-trolling about a growing censoriousness in “the culture” feels almost intentional in its absurdity. At times I approached the book, perhaps to preserve my own psychic integrity, as an avant-garde exercise in narrative unreliability, an experiment in the dizzying extremes of dramatic irony that I associate most with Charles Kinbote, the comically oblivious narrator of Nabokov’s Pale Fire. Again and again I found myself responding to some sententious lament about Silicon Valley’s lack of moral values by scrawling “You run Palantir!” in the margin. Taken in isolation, Karp’s critique of Silicon Valley—that its most talented engineers and entrepreneurs have no sense of the larger public good—is merely banal, rather than wrong. What makes it deeply strange, and genuinely unsettling, is that what he positions as a moral project worthy of these great talents is essentially an algorithmic arms race with America’s geopolitical rivals. This project is, of course, one that Karp views as a defense of the West and its values. But he has almost nothing to say about these values, which he seems uninterested in even defining, let alone analyzing. One of the more aggravating aspects of the book is Karp’s perpetual gesturing in the general direction of philosophy—of serious subjects and serious engagements with them—without ever actually attempting such a thing. On many occasions, for instance, he invokes the philosophical notion of “the good life,” by way of a claim that the talented tech workers of Silicon Valley, and the culture of which they are a part, have entirely abandoned the question of what might constitute it. “The antiseptic nature of modern discourse,” he writes, dominated by an unwavering commitment to justice but deeply wary when it comes to substantive positions on the good life, is a product of our own reluctance, and indeed fear, to offend, to alienate, and to risk the disapproval of the crowd. Silicon Valley, he writes elsewhere, is the product of “a cultural and moral agnosticism if not relativism that assiduously avoided anything approaching substantive views about the good life.” If Karp has any ideas about what “the good life” might actually be, though, he has been extraordinarily successful at keeping them secret. A cynical reader might conclude, in the absence of any other guidance, that perhaps the good life involves becoming a billionaire by selling AI weapons guidance systems and helping governments carry out mass surveillance on their citizens. A more generous reader might conclude that Karp is simply a busy man and doesn’t have the time to think this stuff through. Similarly, the book never delivers on its grandly Platonic title. Not only does Karp fail to describe the “Technological Republic” he invokes; he seems unaware that such a thing might even be expected of him. In this sense, among others, the book reads as the work of someone who wishes to be thought of as a public intellectual but isn’t willing to put in the effort to become one. In the brief passages in which Karp discusses his own leadership of Palantir and his ideas about what constitutes an effective organization, his primary goal is apparently to present himself as an unconventional thinker, by means of strenuously eclectic references—what businesses can learn from the social organization of honeybee swarms, what start-up founders can learn from experimental theater, what Stanley Milgram’s psychological experiments can teach us about creating something new in business, and so on. Such attempts at intellectual grooviness would be risible enough in themselves, were it not for the fact that all this disruptive innovation and free thinking is ultimately in service of a consolidation of state power and business interests—what is normally referred to as the military-industrial complex, which since the end of World War II has been at the root of many long and brutal foreign conflicts, as well as the fortunes of many ruthless and clever opportunists. Another reason The Technological Republic feels strangely untethered is that it seems to have been written toward the prospect of either a second Biden term or a Harris presidency. By the time it was published, in mid-February—when the princelings of Palo Alto were pledging mass fealty at the court of Mar-a-Lago, and Musk’s DOGE was setting about dismantling the federal government—a book-length argument for a closer relationship between Washington and Silicon Valley, and for a tech industry aligned with the broader project of American power, had missed its moment. By that point Mark Zuckerberg had shed his liberal skin and undergone a transfiguration into a kind of uncanny-valley MAGA-bro. In late May he announced that Meta would be partnering with the defense-tech company Anduril to “design, build, and field a range of integrated XR [Extended Reality] products that provide warfighters with enhanced perception and enable intuitive control of autonomous platforms on the battlefield.” The partnership between Meta and Anduril is itself evidence of a major cultural shift. The founder of Anduril (also a Tolkien reference, to a sword in The Lord of the Rings) is Palmer Luckey, best known as the inventor of the Oculus Rift VR headset. After Facebook bought Oculus, Luckey was an employee for a time; in 2017 the company fired him after he donated $10,000 to a pro-Trump group that paid for a billboard campaign deriding Hillary Clinton as “Too Big to Jail.” (Zuckerberg has recently expressed regret about the firing.) Announcing his company’s partnership with Meta, Luckey said, “My mission has long been to turn warfighters into technomancers, and the products we are building with Meta do just that.” One gadget Anduril is developing is called Eagle Eyes—a headset that provides “warfighters” with “360° threat awareness.” Luckey has invoked the video games Call of Duty and Halo. “The idea,” he said, “is to give warfighters superhuman vision, superhuman perception, superhuman hearing, and allow them to communicate with each other and large teams of autonomous systems.” Anduril is precisely the kind of project to which Karp, in The Technological Republic, argues engineers should be devoting their talents. “All these people who used to be tech bros are now defense tech bros,” as Noam Perski, Palantir’s international government lead, put it in a speech last December at a defense tech summit in Tel Aviv. Recently a venture capitalist friend told me that he knew several people in Silicon Valley who, just a few years ago, would have walked briskly in the opposite direction of anything remotely military-related, and who were now working on defense tech. When I agreed that there did seem to be something of a change in the ideological microclimates of the Bay Area, he said that there was no something of about it; it was a hard pivot, and an exceptionally fertile one for investors. See, for instance, Daniel Ek, the cofounder and CEO of Spotify, who led a recent €600 million investment into the German start-up Helsing. The company, cofounded by a video game developer and a former employee of Germany’s defense ministry, makes military drones and AI software for weapons systems and to improve battlefield decision-making. (Spotify subscribers may be interested to know that simply by streaming, say, Bob Dylan’s “Masters of War” or Black Sabbath’s “War Pigs,” they can now help to fund the international arms trade.)
