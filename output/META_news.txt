Nvidia investors are bracing for a roughly $300 billion (€260 billion) swing in market value following quarterly results on Wednesday, amid rising unease over Silicon Valley’s vast spending on artificial intelligence. Options markets imply traders are expecting the artificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker’s share price to move by an average of 6.4 per cent in either direction when markets open on Thursday, equivalent to a gain or loss of about $280 billion in value. Nvidia became the world’s first $5 trillion company at the end of October but since then has been caught up in a sharp stock market sell-off led by big AI players that has dragged the chipmaker’s shares down 11 per cent. Julian Emanuel, Evercore ISI’s chief equities strategist, said: “The angst around ‘peak AI’ has been palpable.” The California-based company’s critical role in the AI boom means its results have in recent years heavily influenced the direction and mood of the broader tech-dominated US stock market. Wednesday’s results arrive as investors’ enthusiasm for the AI boom appears to be on the wane, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite down more than 4 per cent over the past five sessions. [ Concerns mounting that we are well into market-bubble territoryOpens in new window ] Silicon Valley’s biggest companies have been among those hardest hit by the recent bout of selling, with Meta down 19 per cent and Oracle down 20 per cent over the past month. Mike Zigmont, co-head of trading at Visdom Investment Group, said: “In the run-up to Nvidia’s earnings announcement, we’re experiencing cold feet and worry that prices went too high to justify.” “If Nvidia delivers disappointing guidance Wednesday, the [market] is going to sink significantly,” he added. Wall Street is expecting Nvidia to report revenue of about $55.5 billion on Wednesday, according to Visible Alpha data, above the company’s prior guidance in August of roughly $54 billion. The company is also expected to forecast its revenue for the current quarter, which analysts estimate will be about $62 billion, up roughly 58 per cent year-on-year. Nvidia has consistently beaten predictions over recent quarters, ratcheting up expectations that it will outperform again. Chief executive Jensen Huang in October announced the company had secured $500 billion in revenue for the next five quarters, at the high end of Wall Street estimates, helping the company temporarily surpass a record $5 trillion market valuation. Nvidia has been buffeted by volatile trade relations between China and the US this year. A rally in its shares last month was boosted by hopes of a diplomatic breakthrough. But the future of its AI chip sales in China remains uncertain, caught between US export controls and a push from Beijing to build more chips at home. Nvidia has in recent months signed multibillion-dollar deals with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, outside investors and rival tech groups to build data centres that use its chips to run AI models. Analysts have drawn attention to the circularity of some of these agreements, which often involve suppliers, investors and customers of the same handful of companies. Big Tech groups have also recently made greater use of public and private debt markets to fund their spending on AI infrastructure, which they had previously largely paid for with cash. Nvidia and Microsoft on Tuesday agreed to invest up to $15 billion in Anthropic, whose chatbot Claude is a major competitor to OpenAI. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2025 Join The Irish Times on WhatsApp and stay up to date Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Inside the California 'AI factory' that showcases the contradiction at the heart of the tech race

Google's ultra-private CEO Sundar Pichai is showing me around Googleplex, its California headquarters. A walkway runs along the length of it, passing by a giant dinosaur skeleton, a beach volleyball pitch and dozens of Googlers lunching under the hazy November sun. But it's a laboratory, hidden away at the back of the campus behind some trees, that he is most excited for me to see. This is where the invention that Google believes is its secret weapon is being developed. Known as a Tensor Processing Unit (or TPU), it looks like an unassuming little chip but, says Mr Pichai, it will one day power every AI query that goes through Google. This makes it potentially one of the most important objects in the world economy right now. "AI is the most profound technology humanity [has ever worked] on," he insists. "It has potential for extraordinary benefits - we will have to work through societal disruptions." But the confusing question lingering over the AI hype is whether it is a bubble at risk of bursting - as, if so, it may well be a spectacular burst akin to the dotcom crash at the start of the century, with consequences for us all. The Bank of England has already warned of a "sudden correction" in global financial markets, saying "market valuations appear stretched" for tech AI firms. Meanwhile. OpenAI boss Sam Altman has speculated that "there are many parts of AI that I think are kind of bubbly right now". Asked whether Google would be immune from a potential bubble burst, Mr Pichai said it could weather that potential storm - but for all his starry-eyed excitement around the possibilities of AI, he also issued a warning: "I think no company is going to be immune, including us." So why, then, is Google investing more than $90bn a year in the AI build-out, a three-fold increase in just four years, at the very moment these suggestions are being discussed? The AI surge - of which Google is just one part - is, in cash terms, the biggest market boom the world has seen. Its numbers are extraordinary - there is $15 trillion of market value at Google and four other tech giants whose headquarters are all within a short drive of one another. Chipmaker turned AI systems pioneer Nvidia in Santa Clara is now worth more than $5 trillion. A 10-minute drive south, in Cupertino, is Apple HQ, hovering around $4 trillion; while 15 minutes west is $1.9 trillion Meta (previously Facebook). And in the centre of San Francisco, OpenAI was recently valued at $500bn. The purely financial consequences of this trend are significant enough. The value of the shares in these companies (and a few others outside Silicon Valley, such as Microsoft in Seattle) have helped cushion the US economy from the impact of trade wars, and kept retirement plans and investments buoyant - and not just in the US. Yet it comes with a big risk. That is, the incredible dependence of US stock market growth on the performance of a handful of tech giants. The Magnificent 7 - Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla - collectively comprise one third of the valuation of America's entire S&P 500. And that market value is now more highly concentrated in a few firms than it was during the dotcom bubble in 1999, according to the IMF. Mr Pichai points out that every decade or so come these "inflection points": the personal computer, then the internet in the late 1990s, followed by mobile and cloud. "Now it's clearly the era of Artificial Intelligence." But as for the big question - is it a bubble? Mr Pichai argues there are two ways of thinking about it. First, there is "palpably exciting" progress of services that people and companies are using. But he concedes: "It's also true when we go through these investment cycles, there are moments we overshoot collectively as an industry… "So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this." Now, a distinction is emerging in the markets between those businesses that rely on often borrowed money and complicated deals to access the chips that power their AI, and the biggest tech companies, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, which can fund investment in chips and data from their own pockets. Which brings us to Google's own silicon chips, or their prized TPUs. The lab, where they are tested, is the size of a five-a-side football pitch with a mesh of multi-coloured wires and deep blue blinking lights. Signs all around read: "restricted". What's striking is the sheer noise - this is down to the cooling systems, which are needed to help control the temperature of the chips, which can get incredibly hot when crunching trillions of calculations. The TPUs are designed to help power AI machines. And they work differently from other types of chips. The CPU (central processing unit) is the primary component of a computer - essentially its brain - that performs most of the processing and control functions, while GPUs (graphics processing units) perform more specialised processing, executing many parallel tasks at once - this can include AI. However Asics (application-specific integrated circuits), are chips custom-built for a specific purpose, for example, a specific AI algorithm. And the TPU is a specialist Google-designed type of Asic. A core aspect of the AI boom has been the mad dash to amass lots of top-performing chips and put them into data centres (or the physical facilities that store, process and run large amounts of data and software). Nvidia's boss Jensen Huang once coined the term "AI factories" to describe the massive data centres full of pods and racks of super chips, connected to huge energy and cooling systems. (Tech bosses such as Mark Zuckerberg have referred to some being the size of Manhattan. The Google TPU lab is somewhat more modest, testing out the technology for deployment elsewhere.) Stories abound of tech bros begging chip makers for hundreds of thousands of these highly engineered pieces of silicon. Take the recent dinner at Nobu in Palo Alto, where Elon Musk and Larry Ellison, the founder and head of Oracle, tried to woo Nvidia's Jensen Huang, to sell them more of them. As Mr Ellison put it: "I would describe the dinner as me and Elon begging Jensen for GPUs. Please take our money - no, no take more. You're not taking enough. We need you to take more, please!" It is precisely the race to access the power of as many as possible of these high performance chips, and to scale them up into massive data centres, that is driving an AI boom - and there's a perception that the only way to win is to keep spending. The terrace of the Rosewood Sand Hill hotel, a sprawling 16-acre estate near the Santa Cruz mountains that serves crab rolls and $35 signature vodka martinis, is where the big Silicon Valley deal-making gets done. It's close to Stanford University and Meta's HQ, as well as the headquarters of major venture capital firms. There are whispered rumours about who will be next to announce customised AI chips - Asics - to compete with Google and Nvidia. Just before I visited, something of a storm was brewing about the investment plans of OpenAI, which Elon Musk co-founded. The firm, which started as a not-for-profit but has since established a commercial structure, has been the focus of a web of cross-investments involving buying up chips and other computer hardware needed for AI processing. Few in the industry doubt OpenAI's phenomenal user growth - in particular the popularity of its chatbot, ChatGPT. It has ambitions to design its own custom AI chips, but some have speculated about whether it might need government support to achieve this. In a podcast episode that aired last month, an OpenAI investor questioned how the company's spending commitments tallied with its revenues, to which co-founder Sam Altman shot back, challenging the revenue figures quoted, and adding: "If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough." He has since shared a lengthy post on X, explaining, among other things, that OpenAI is looking at commitments of about $1.4 trillion over the next eight years and why he believes now is the time to invest in scaling up their technology. "I do not think the government should be writing insurance policies for AI companies," he said. But he also said: "What we do think might make sense is governments building (and owning) their own AI infrastructure." Elsewhere, there have been notable very recent falls in share prices of AI infrastructure companies - Coreweave, a start-up that supplies OpenAI, saw its shares lose 26% of their value earlier this month. Plus, there have been some reactions in markets for perceived credit risk among other firms. And while most of these tech share prices have generally climbed higher over the course of 2025, there has been a mild dip more generally in the past few days. None of this has dampened the excitement over AI's potential within the industry. Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, launched to great fanfare earlier this week — this will pitch Google in a direct battle with OpenAI and its still-dominant ChatGPT for the market share. What we don't yet know is whether it marks an end to the days of chatbots going rogue and recommending glue as a pizza ingredient. So, is the end result of all this fantastic investment is that information is less reliable, I asked Mr Pichai. "I think if you only construct systems standalone and you only rely on that, [that] would be true," he told me. "Which is why I think we have to make the information ecosystem has to be much richer than just having AI technology being the sole product in it." But I put it to him that truth matters. His response: "truth matters". Nor is the other big question facing tech today dampening the enthusiasm around advancing AI's potential. That is: how on Earth to power it? By 2030, data centres around the world will use about as much electricity as India did in 2023, according to the IMF. Yet this is also an age where energy supply is under pressure by governments committing to climate change targets. I put this to Google's Mr Pichai, asking if it is coherent to have ambitions to generate 95% of electricity from low-carbon sources by 2030 - as the UK government does - and also be an AI superpower? "I think it's possible. But I think for every government, including the UK, it's important to figure out how to scale up infrastructure, including energy infrastructure. "You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy," he adds. "I think that will have consequences." Years ago, as a fledgling reporter I cut my teeth in the 2000 dotcom bubble. It followed a famous speech by Federal Reserve Governor Alan Greenspan about "irrational exuberance". In that time I interviewed Steve Jobs twice, and a few years later questioned Mr Pichai's predecessor Larry Page, and commentated live on the collapse of WorldOfFruit.com. Through it all, one lesson became clear: that even in the worst-case scenarios and the toughest of crashes, catastrophe isn't guaranteed for all. Take Amazon - its share price slumped to $6 and its market capitalisation fell to $4bn during that crash, yet some 25 years on Jeff Bezos and his company are very much going strong. Today Amazon is worth $2.4 trillion. The same would, inevitably, be true of companies shaken by a potential AI bubble burst. Plus there is another looming factor that may well explain why so many in Silicon Valley - and beyond - are blind to, or perhaps choosing not to, acknowledge this risk, and pushing on regardless. That is, the attraction of the glittering prize at the end: achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI). This is the point at which machines match human intelligence, something many believe is within reach. Or beyond that, reaching artificial super-intelligence (ASI), the point at which machines surpass our intelligence. But I was also told something else that was thought-provoking by a Silicon Valley figure - that it doesn't matter whether there really is a bubble or if it bursts. Step back and what is going on in the bigger picture is a global battle for AI supremacy, with the US against China taking centre stage. And while Beijing funds these developments centrally, in the US it is a messy but productive free market free for all, which means trial and error on an epic scale. For now, the US has superiority in silicon over China - companies like Nvidia with their GPUs and Google with their TPUs can afford to accelerate into the storm. Others will surely fail, and spectacularly so, affecting markets, consumer sentiment and the world economy. The physical footprint left behind, however, containing sheer computing firepower for the deployment of mass AI technologies, will inevitably shape our economy and could well also shape how we work and learn - and who dominates the world for the rest of the 21st Century.

Title: AI Slop Has Turned Social Media Into an Antisocial Wasteland
URL: https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/ai-slop-has-turned-social-media-into-an-antisocial-wasteland/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T13:01:25Z

Commentary: Platforms that once helped us stay in touch have become fractured and impersonal -- and AI slop and deepfakes are making it so much worse. Social media is becoming more unbearable, thanks to AI. Social media has never been lauded for realism, but online deceit is reaching a fever pitch. Since the inception of platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, aspirational content has flooded our feeds with too-perfect bodies, homes and lifestyles. Despite the supposed aim of social media to keep us connected, going online increasingly feels isolating and detached from reality. AI slop and deepfakes are making it infinitely worse. The emergence of generative AI tools like OpenAI's Sora, Google's Veo and Midjourney has facilitated the creation of videos that are all at once extraordinary, imaginative and deceptive. Suddenly, a simple text prompt can conjure anything you think up. It's a technological marvel, and, oftentimes, an ethical nightmare. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. AI slop refers to the endless barrage of low-quality digital content created with artificial intelligence. You've likely seen examples of this on your social media feeds, from videos of animals exhibiting oddly human characteristics to pranks and gags that seem to defy the laws of physics. In addition, deepfakes of public figures, both alive and dead, saying and doing things that never actually happened have become a hot -- and contentious -- commodity. It's not just shoddy AI that's diminishing the online experience. Filtering through more convincing fabrications of people, places and events demands more vigilance than ever, and it's utterly exhausting. Ever since the rollout of OpenAI's Sora app in September, I've wondered why anyone would want to scroll through a feed made up solely of artificial moments. Even more "traditional" social platforms like Instagram and TikTok have become inundated with AI content that seemingly serves no real purpose, beyond demonstrating the astonishingly lifelike imagery that AI tools can now conjure in an instant. Isn't the point of social media to stay in touch with people you know and to follow public figures that interest you? Is that foundational objective officially dead? "The cynical answer is that social media is now aimed at keeping you connected to the tool, rather than to each other," said Alexios Mantzarlis, director of Cornell Tech's Security, Trust and Safety Initiative. Tech giants are "making their stock price go up" by showing off their AI capabilities, he said, but "it's coming at the expense of the experience on these platforms." Indeed, that heightened artificiality clashes with the authenticity many of us seek and increasingly struggle to find online. One of the reasons I fell in love with TikTok years ago is that it's easier to find more genuine, unfiltered content -- a welcome relief from the overly polished influencer posts flooding my Instagram feed, although I increasingly see my fair share of that on TikTok, too. Even before the rise of generative AI, Instagram updates from friends and family have largely been supplanted by content from high-profile creators I don't follow. That's not always a bad thing, as it often exposes me to topics I want to see more of. That focus on user interests is what makes TikTok's algorithm in particular so powerful (and addictive). But it makes me feel even more disconnected from the people I actually do know -- especially since everyday folks are seemingly posting less nowadays. Factor AI into that equation, and any semblance of authenticity fades away. Now, along with battling feelings of insecurity from seeing touched-up images of real people, you may also stumble upon vacation photos that are entirely AI-generated, or come across an AI influencer that amplifies unattainable beauty standards. "Before, we had the problem of unrealistic body expectations," Mantzarlis said. "And now we're facing the world of unreal body expectations." It's becoming harder for people to separate fact from fiction, but the dissemination of slop and deepfakes isn't slowing down. The clock is ticking for platforms to regulate this new wave of content before it drowns out our sense of reality. Social media companies like Meta and TikTok have pledged to label AI-generated content and ban harmful posts such as fake crisis events or the use of private individuals' likenesses without their permission. On Wednesday, TikTok said it'll start testing a new control for people to choose how much AI-generated content they want to see in their feeds. Pinterest rolled out a similar feature last month. But in the absence of government regulation -- which is lagging due to factors like political gridlock over how to regulate AI, lobbying from tech firms (Meta recently launched a super PAC to push back on AI laws) and the rapid rate at which the technology is evolving -- it's up to companies to uphold their own policies. It can admittedly be tricky for sites to flag everything given the sheer volume of content, but so far, their perfunctory efforts don't seem very promising. That lack of regulation can magnify distrust and discord online. An August study by Raptive, a media company that works with digital creators, found that when people merely suspected content was AI-generated, they instinctively distanced themselves from it. Specifically, 48% of respondents found the content to be less trustworthy, while 60% said they felt a lower emotional connection to it. But with influencer-created content dominating most social platforms these days, AI can be marketed as a way to simplify a traditionally time-consuming process. "AI tools make it easier for more people to be creators," said Paul Bannister, chief strategy officer at Raptive. "It increases the footprint of who can be a creator much faster." Chatting with Bannister helped to offset a bit of my skepticism; he reminded me that "like any new technology, there are always good and bad uses." Along with AI slop, he noted, there's still human creativity behind the (oftentimes ridiculous) AI content we see online. "There will be lots of junk and bumps in the road and problems, but maybe this can create amazing new forms of information-sharing and entertainment," Bannister said. "There's still so much junk flowing through the system that we don't know what that outcome is going to be." There's another side to what AI is capable of: "It's going to be used for further exacerbating tensions, for confirming people's pre-existing biases," Mantzarlis said. Social media is already an echo chamber for reaffirming people's harmful, close-minded viewpoints and rapidly spreading misinformation. I'm not sure we're prepared for just how much worse that can get when everyone has the power to easily manufacture their own reality and share it with the world. The fracturing of society is only going to show wider cracks. If anything, I'd appreciate it if more platforms gave us the option to dial down how much AI we see on our feeds. Though given the choice, I'd dial it all the way down to zero.

Title: Nvidia’s earnings could answer the AI bubble question and upend global markets in moment of truth for Magnificent 7
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/19/nvidia-earnings-artificial-intelligence-magnificent-seven-apple-stocks-investors-guide/
Time Published: 2025-11-19T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Nvidia’s Jensen Huang says he doesn’t believe we’re in an artificial intelligence bubble. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos says we probably are in one. OpenAI’s Sam Altman, the human face of the AI boom, has also invoked a bubble, adding, “I do think some investors are likely to lose a lot of money.” This, in a nutshell, is the narrative of the entire global stock market right now and the conundrum that no tech CEO or asset manager can avoid addressing: Is AI a bubble or not? Much is at stake. Since the current bull market began in October 2022, roughly 75% of gains in the S&P 500 have come from just seven stocks—Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Those companies, known as the Magnificent Seven, have a combined market cap of about $21.5 trillion as of mid-November. Their strategies, Apple’s perhaps excepted, are heavily dependent on AI. But if AI does not deliver the revenues or the efficiencies that Big Tech expects, the fallout in stocks will likely be severe—because the world’s investable assets are currently concentrated in AI and AI-adjacent stocks to an unprecedented degree. The S&P 500 had risen 14.7% this year (at the time of writing), repeatedly breaking new record highs. But 40% of the index’s value comes from the 10 biggest stocks within it, all but one of which are tech companies. Most of those companies, in turn, are pouring vast sums into AI for the development of new data centers, large language models, and the massive amounts of electricity they guzzle. Goldman Sachs estimates that capital expenditure on AI will hit $390 billion this year and increase by another 19% in 2026. Bank of America is even more bullish: It projects that AI capex will hit $1.2 trillion in 2030. The recipients of the lion’s share of that money are 10 AI companies that are interlocked with one another as customers and investors in an “increasingly circular” way, as a recent research note from Morgan Stanleydescribed it. That note referenced relationships between OpenAI, Nvidia, Oracle, Microsoft, CoreWeave, and AMD, involving billions in equity stakes, revenue sharing, vendor financing, and “repurchase agreement[s]” being passed back and forth among them. On one level, that’s normal: Most industries feature a collection of companies that do business with one another. The problem in AI is that the revenues currently being generated by AI companies are far smaller than the amount of capex being directed at them by the Magnificent Seven. The back-of-the-envelope math is harsh: AI capex coming from tech companies listed in the S&P 500 is $400 billion or more per year, going forward. The biggest AI company—OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT—has disclosed revenues of just $13 billion for 2025. Altman recently said revenues were “well more” than that, hinting they may hit $100 billion in 2027. But that’s still nowhere near the level of capex it’s committing to. OpenAI may have lost $12 billion in the third quarter of 2025 alone, according to a disclosure by Microsoft, which has a 32.5% stake in the company. Yet it has committed to spending $1.4 trillion to develop its product—and it is valued by its venture capital and other investors at $500 billion. These numbers don’t add up—and won’t until the massive AI rollout starts to yield real financial benefits. “That is exactly the discussion in the market at the moment. Can the 10 AI companies generate enough revenue to justify the capex?” says Torsten Sløk, chief economist at Apollo Global Management. If the answer to that question is no, or more relevantly, not soon enough to satisfy investors’ expectations about the future, then the fallout in global equities could be brutal. Take, for instance, the Russell 2000, an index of small-cap U.S. companies: 806 of them, or about 40%, have no earnings or negative earnings. Counterintuitively, the stocks of unprofitable Russell companies have outperformed those that actually made money this year, according to Apollo. Most of those unprofitable companies are tech firms, riding the AI narrative. With the Magnificent Seven dominating large-cap stocks, and money-losing small-caps soaring from optimism around AI, any reversal in sentiment will be widespread, especially if it’s triggered by a softening in AI infrastructure spending. And the broader repercussions in equity markets could be even greater. Since 1990, U.S. assets of all kinds—stocks, bonds, property, you name it—have become increasingly dominant globally. U.S. stocks now account for about 60% of the valuation of all stocks on the planet, according to Christian Mueller-Glissmann, Goldman Sachs’ managing director and head of asset allocation research. And technology stocks represent about 45% of all U.S. stocks, worth $26 trillion or more at the close of October, according to S&P Global. In other words, most of the world’s assets currently look like an upside-down pyramid, teetering on its point. The wide base at the top consists mostly of U.S. equities; underneath that, the performance of those equities is driven by just seven public tech companies. Those seven companies are funding 10 or so much smaller private AI companies, upon whose fortunes they currently rely. And those AI companies—at the very bottom of the inverted triangle—are largely unprofitable. There’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘show me the money’ moment. We think we’re pretty close to the moon already. For that reason, owning the S&P 500 via an exchange-traded fund, traditionally one of the safest and most common bets for smaller “retail” investors, isn’t providing the diversification it used to. Today, it’s largely a bet on a few globally massive tech platforms—concentrating millions of people’s retirement savings toward the tip of that pyramid. The world’s dependence on U.S. equities stems in part from the fact that the U.S. is simply the largest economy in the world, says Mueller-Glissmann, making the concentration a proportional reflection of economic reality. But it also means that if U.S. equities are in a bubble, then the whole world is in a bubble—whether we like it or not. The reason U.S. stocks have become so much bigger than foreign stocks is that the U.S. has a heavier concentration of finance and tech stocks compared with the rest of the world, Mueller-Glissmann adds. Those sectors enjoy a high degree of operating cost leverage, or the ability to increase revenues without adding many new staff or resources. An app with 200 million users doesn’t have anywhere close to twice the running costs of an app with 100 million users, but if a gold mining company wants to double its capacity, it pretty much needs to double its costs in equipment and labor. America has an enormous amount of this “financialization,” Mueller-Glissmann says. “That makes [the] argument a bit more scary, in the sense that this world portfolio is getting more and more important for the global economy in terms of driving wealth effects and in terms of driving financial conditions. So for the next 12 months, investors will stay closely tuned to the revenue picture in AI. For now, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Apollo, and Bank of America have all either published research or told Fortune directly that they expect capex growth for AI to continue unabated through 2026. The bubble has a way to go, in other words. The advice—as always—is to sell…but not right now! (For some concrete investing ideas, see the following pages.) At some point, the tide will go out, and stock investors, venture capital firms, and Big Tech’s AI capex “hyperscalers” will all want to know who has a viable business and who is swimming naked, according to Lisa Shalett, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s chief investment officer. That, in turn, could be the catalyst for a much broader stock market reckoning. Shalett believes that the current period of American exceptionalism—in which U.S. companies and assets dominate the global economy—is due to unwind in what she calls a “great rebalancing.” And when that happens, she wrote in a recent note to clients, its impact won’t be limited to companies with direct stakes in the AI boom. Since the financial crisis of 2008, Shalett argues, American stock market outperformance relative to the rest of the world has been “‘supercharged’ by historic monetary policy intervention” that kept interest rates near zero; deficit spending and fiscal stimulus, including about $4.6 trillion in relief outlays at the height of the COVID pandemic; “and the fruits of globalization, which were enhanced by the privilege of having the world’s reserve currency.” Those factors, Shalett believes, are likely to phase out over the next five to 10 years, with negative implications for U.S. stocks across the board. And that’s where the AI bubble question takes on even more weight. Over the past year, sky-high projections about AI’s economic benefits have helped investors ignore a steady flow of troubling economic indicators. If AI reality fails to live up to the hype, gloom could spread quickly. With global trade becoming more expensive under President Trump’s tariffs, inflation now a semipermanent feature of economic life, and the U.S. facing potential pressure from the bond market to balance its fiscal books, investors are unlikely to be generous if they detect that reliable earnings-per-share growth has been replaced by speculative folly. “People realize that there’s only so much of this story that you can price into the future without the ‘Show me the money’ moment,” Shalett tells Fortune. “We think we’re pretty close to the moon already.” And if asset values come back down to earth, the challenge will be to avoid burning up on reentry. 75% $21.5 trillion 30.9 This article appears in the December 2025/January 2026 issue of Fortune with the headline “How an AI bubble could ruin the party.”

Title: WhatsApp owns India! - by Dharmesh Ba
URL: https://newsletter.theindianotes.com/p/whatsapp-owns-india
Time Published: 2025-11-19T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
India’s most used business software isn’t chosen - it’s tolerated. Over the past 18 months, I poured lakhs of rupees and time into building automation tools on top of WhatsApp - and failed. That failure opened up something bigger: a look into the tangled web that holds up India’s messaging infrastructure. This is everything good, bad, and quietly dangerous about WhatsApp - and our growing dependence on it. It’s quite a long read. In 2023, I met a cosmetic store owner in Nagpur who had accidentally invented demand forecasting. He sells beauty products - Korean serums, Indian sunscreens, foreign moisturizers. His challenge wasn’t competition or pricing. It was more existential: his shelf space could hold maybe 200 SKUs, but his customers now wanted access to 2,000. Ten years ago, this wasn’t a problem. A woman would walk into his store, and he’d guide her. “Try this Lakmé sunscreen. Let me show you how to apply it.” He hired young women specifically for this - people who could explain products, who could teach. But Instagram changed the game. Women no longer came to his store to discover products. They came with screenshots, asking for specific Korean brands they’d seen on reels. If he didn’t have it, they left. And he couldn’t stock everything. So he invented a system. He joined a vendor WhatsApp group - wholesalers who posted about new products arriving in the market. When something looked promising, he’d post the image to his WhatsApp status. Or he’d share it in a customer group he’d built over years. Then he’d wait. If even two or three people asked for the price, he knew there was demand. He’d place an order before the product even touched his shelf. He wasn’t using WhatsApp for communication and marketing alone but turned it into a just-in-time inventory system. This was India’s answer to the Shopify + Stripe stack. Discovery happened on Instagram. Demand validation happened on WhatsApp Status. Payment happened on UPI. Small businesses had discovered that consumer apps could be hacked into business tools. In this WhatsApp owns India’s communications layer. And unlike every other tech platform, there’s no competitor even close. Instagram competes with Twitter and YouTube. WhatsApp has... nothing. This creates both opportunity and danger. WhatsApp isn’t a product Indians use. It’s infrastructure Indians depend on. Infrastructure is different from products. Products are things you choose. Infrastructure is what you assume exists. You don’t think about electricity until the power goes out. You don’t think about roads until they’re blocked. India stopped thinking about WhatsApp years ago. It’s just... there. Assumed. Essential. This matters because of a simple truth: when something becomes infrastructure, its problems stop being individual frustrations and start being citizen problems. A business owner spending two hours a day manually managing WhatsApp groups isn’t just inefficient - it’s a productivity tax on the entire economy. WhatsApp work messages and personal messages in groups - it’s a design failure that affects work-life balance for millions. The question isn’t whether India needs better WhatsApp tools. The question is whether WhatsApp, as designed by Meta for Meta’s goals, can ever serve as the infrastructure India needs. To answer that, we need to understand what WhatsApp actually is - and what it isn’t. Most people think WhatsApp is a single app. It isn’t. Meta offers three distinct products with different users: WhatsApp: The everyday consumer app WhatsApp Business: A mobile app for small businesses, with profiles, catalogs, chat labels, and auto-replies to manage customer chats. WhatsApp Business API: Not an app but infrastructure - an API (via Meta Cloud or Business Solution Partners [1]) that connects WhatsApp to CRMs or back-end systems for large-scale messaging. Bottom line: one phone number can be linked to only one WhatsApp product at a time. If it’s registered on the WhatsApp Business API, it can’t also be used on the standard app - and vice versa. Though WhatsApp has rolled out a recent workaround. Here’s the critical part: these three “WhatsApps” behave very differently The consumer app and the WhatsApp Business mobile app expose full phone UIs (groups, stories, calls, broadcast lists, catalogs) that people and small shops use directly on an app. But the WhatsApp Business API historically only supported a subset of the app features and couldn’t do many of the interactive, UI-driven fetures that make WhatsApp feel like WhatsApp. For example, you cannot create or manage groups, post WhatsApp Status, or manage channels via APIs yet. Update: Meta has added Groups endpoints and a Calling API to the WhatsApp Business Platform. You can now automate some group actions and initiate voice calls via the API - within tight limits and platform rules. As of Oct 28, 2025 there’s still no official API to post Status Updates like the mobile app. In short: when small businesses say “we run everything on WhatsApp,” they usually mean the consumer or Business mobile apps - with manual groups, broadcasts, and catalogs. True automation and scale require the Business Platform/API, which is powerful but not really designed for typical SME needs. WhatsApp’s business model is simple. Meta charges per message on the WhatsApp Business API, with rates varying by country and message type (Marketing, Utility, Authentication, Service). Businesses can reply free of charge within 24 hours of a user’s message; after that, only approved templates can be sent - and those cost money. In India, rates are about ₹0.78 for marketing and ₹0.11 for utility/authentication messages. Example: 10,000 marketing messages = ₹7,800; 1,000,000 = ₹7.8 lakh monthly. Businesses can use the platform directly via Meta’s Cloud API or through Business Solutions Providers like Gupshup, WATI, Interakt, or Twilio. BSPs add their own fees on top of Meta’s, so prices include markups and platform charges. Most WhatsApp SaaS vendors sell both software and message credits - earning largely from those markups. When Meta changes rates, profits shrink or costs rise for customers, creating instability. The pricing volatility makes WhatsApp a shaky base for predictable business models. Here’s a paradox: The businesses that most need WhatsApp automation are the ones least able to use it. For instance, one of the most common patterns we’ve seen is business owners consistently updating their WhatsApp status each morning with details about the day’s fresh vegetables, sharing posts about new stock in their groups, and responding to customer inquiries within minutes. These actions have become almost daily rituals for entrepreneurs running their businesses on WhatsApp. Such simple automations today are not possible on the main WhatsApp mobile apps but only possible in their API version. Most small businesses in India use one phone number for everything - personal and work. But the WhatsApp Business API needs a separate, dedicated number that can’t run on the regular or Business app. Porting the existing number would mean losing existing chats and giving up the mobile app and certain crucial features like groups management and WhatsApp status posting. Without the WhatsApp Business API even simple automations stay out of reach for SMEs Even with an additional number, setup is a pain. You need to link it to Meta Business Manager, create and submit message templates - all buried in Meta’s dashboards. Many small businesses turn to unofficial modified versions (mods) of WhatsApp or to access automation and additional features. GBWhatsApp is the most famous unofficial app that can help you run two accounts, auto-reply, tag chats, and send follow-ups, see deleted messages - without using the official API. These tools work but violate WhatsApp’s rules, risk malware or data leaks, and can lead to account bans. Here are some top features of the WhatsApp ‘mods’ that are helpful for SMEs Auto Reply: Configure automatic replies per message or contact. Message Scheduler: Schedule messages to send at set times. Broadcast to Multiple Groups: Send one message across several groups at once. Multi Account Support: Use two or more WhatsApp accounts on one device. Bypass Forward Limit: Forward messages to unlimited chats. Always Online Mode: Keep your status showing online continuously. It’s a messy market trading serious security and compliance risks for convenience. The irony is almost poetic: WhatsApp became essential infrastructure because it was simple and open to everyone. Yet, the moment businesses try to do anything advanced with it, it turns into a maze. And there’s another catch: most WhatsApp automation tools live on the web, not as mobile apps. Why? Because if you try to launch a mobile app called “WhatsApp for Business” or “WhatsApp Automation,” Meta will hit you with a trademark notice, and Google Play will take it down. So every SaaS company ends up building a web dashboard instead. But the small business owners live on their mobile devices. If the problem were just technical limits, businesses could adapt- learn the rules, find workarounds, move on. But the real instability comes from something deeper: WhatsApp optimizes for Meta’s goals, not yours - and those goals change without warning. That creates systemic unpredictability that businesses quietly pay for. Delivery drops: In 2022–23, marketing messages reached 90–95% of users. By mid-2025, that fell below 75%. Meta added hidden user-level caps to fight spam - no announcement, no numbers. Businesses only found out after delivery cratered. [2] Sudden suspensions: Accounts get blocked - sometimes permanently - for vague policy violations. The appeal process is slow, and while it runs, operations stop cold. [3] Shifting rules: In Oct 2025, WhatsApp quietly banned all “general-purpose AI chatbots.” The term isn’t defined, leaving even compliant tools exposed. [4] Even if you master the tech, pricing, and compliance, you’re still building on shifting ground - where Meta’s priorities decide your uptime. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: these aren’t problems Meta is trying to solve. They’re features of the system working as intended. Meta is an advertising company; ads pay the bills. Every product in their portfolio - Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, even Oculus - exists to collect data and sell ads. WhatsApp is the outlier. It’s a messaging tool that, in a different world, might have evolved like Telegram, Slack or Microsoft Teams: an open platform where developers build productivity tools, businesses customize workflows, and ecosystems flourish. But that’s not Meta’s DNA. If WhatsApp opened up like Slack, businesses would build their own solutions. They’d customize the experience. They’d create value that Meta couldn’t capture. From Meta’s perspective, that’s money left on the table. So instead, WhatsApp is being slowly transformed into an ads platform. You’re starting to see it: Ads in WhatsApp Status (already rolling out) Paid WhatsApp channels (in beta) Business messaging in groups Click to WhatsApp ads From a pure business perspective, this makes sense. Why would Meta invest engineering resources to solve a hundred-million-dollar problem (Indian MSME productivity) when they could deploy those same resources toward a billion-dollar opportunity (WhatsApp ads)? To put it bluntly: Meta doesn’t care about your kirana store’s inventory management problem. Not because they’re evil, but because they’re a trillion-dollar company optimizing for trillion-dollar opportunities. WhatsApp will never be the open platform India needs, because Meta’s business model requires it to stay closed. Which raises an obvious question: If WhatsApp can’t serve as the infrastructure India needs, what can? India’s WhatsApp problem isn’t unique. China faced something similar a decade ago - and solved it deliberately. WeChat handles everything WhatsApp does, plus native payments, mini-apps, ride-hailing, food delivery, and government services. The architectural choices Tencent made are precisely what WhatsApp lacks. In WeChat, businesses can send users only 4 marketing messages directly per month through service account. Beyond that, marketing messages get quarantined into a separate subscription feed/folder - visible but segregated from personal conversations. This forces discipline. Every message must justify its existence. The result: businesses target better, users feel less harassed, and the platform maintains trust. WhatsApp has no such limits. Businesses face tiered messaging caps (starting at 1,000 recipients daily for new accounts) but these scale automatically based on quality scores. The only real constraint is cost - and when marketing messages work, companies pay willingly. The incentive structure rewards volume, not restraint. When an employee leaves a Chinese company, their WeChat relationships vanish with them- customer conversations, sales context, years of institutional knowledge, gone. Tencent solved this with WeCom (WeChat Work), a parallel app for professional communication. In WeCom, workplace conversations belong to the company, not the employee. When someone leaves, their account transfers. Customer relationships survive. Search for a person on WeChat in China, you see two options: their personal WeChat, professional WeCom. Same ecosystem, separate contexts. You message friends on WeChat, coordinate work on WeCom. Both feel familiar, both interoperate, neither bleeds into the other. In 2022, WeCom has about 180 Million active users and are used by over 10 million businesses in China. [5] The boutique store owner shouldn’t manage customer orders where his daughter sends memes. The sales team shouldn’t lose client relationships when someone quits. The contractor shouldn’t coordinate labor in the same group planning his wife’s birthday. The solution exists. WeCom proves separating contexts without fragmenting networks is possible. But WhatsApp won’t implement it - not because of encryption, but because of infrastructure. WhatsApp’s value to Meta isn’t in reading your messages - they’re encrypted. It’s in the metadata around them: who you talk to, when, from where, and which businesses you engage with. Meta has added ads to WhatsApp’s Status tab, but the real value lies in metadata and business messaging, not large-scale ad placements. Linking WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram through Accounts Center lets Meta build a unified behavioral profile - without touching message content. [6] Splitting personal and professional WhatsApp use would shatter that identity layer. Meta wouldn’t lose access to messages - it never had them - but it would lose the metadata correlation powering cross-platform personalization. Keeping all communication in one place creates richer data, tighter business tracking, and a more valuable ecosystem. Which leaves the real question: if Meta won’t separate it, who will? WhatsApp isn’t going anywhere.Half a billion Indians won’t switch apps. Businesses won’t rebuild customer relationships. The network effects are too strong, the switching costs too high. Our goal should be to build optionality in the form of building ONDC-like infra for messaging. A protocol could make the platform used irrelevant. Instead of building one mega-app to rule all of e-commerce, ONDC built the rails underneath. A seller listing on one ONDC app can be discovered by buyers on completely different apps. Orders, payments, fulfillment - all work across platforms. No gatekeepers. Just open infrastructure. The same architecture can break WhatsApp’s monopoly. A messaging protocol doesn’t need 500 million users on day one. It needs 500,000 users who will pay because the protocol solves a problem WhatsApp won’t. For example we could start with construction contractors. They need labor coordination, site photos, payment tracking, and material orders - all over messaging. WhatsApp works, but barely. A purpose-built tool would save them hours daily. That’s the wedge. Once one vertical proves interoperability works, others follow - logistics, healthcare, education, government services. The network grows without forcing anyone to switch. The protocol layer should provide the essential stuff: End-to-end encryption standards Message delivery guarantees Identity verification Cross-app routing APIs Different apps build specialized experiences on top: One for Gen Z, one for the elderly, one for MSMEs and they should all be able to talk to each other. Same network. Different interfaces. Just like you can email someone on Gmail from Outlook. The protocol doesn’t care. It just routes messages. Email, the web, and Bluetooth already work on open protocols. WhatsApp solved India’s communication problem. Now India needs to solve WhatsApp’s incentive problem. That doesn’t mean banning WhatsApp or building a clone. It means creating optionality - a messaging layer where WhatsApp is one choice among many, not the only one that works. This isn’t about nationalism or rejecting foreign technology. It’s about infrastructure resilience. No nation should have its business communication layer entirely controlled by a single foreign corporation with different incentives. The question isn’t whether to replace WhatsApp. The question is: What does India need to build so that WhatsApp’s limitations stop being India’s limitations? That’s the conversation worth having.

You can download the People’s Voice report on AI opportunities for Indian SMEs, created by People+AI in collaboration with 1990 Research Labs, below. Download Report This is hands-down one of the best infrastructure analysis pieces I've read on Indian tech. The cosmetic store owner's WhatsApp-as-inventory-system story perfectly captures how consumer apps get hacked into business tools when proper B2B infrastructure doesn't exist. What really stands out is your framing of the incentive mismatch: Meta optimizes for trillion-dollar ad opportunities while Indian MSMEs need hundred-million-dollar productivity solutions. That gap explains everything - the API restrictions, the pricing volatility, the feature stagnation. The WeChat/WeCom comparison is especially powerful because it shows the solution exists and works at scale. The separation of personal and professional contexts isn't a technical challenge, it's a business model choice. Meta won't build it because unified identity metadata across contexts is more valuable than serving SME needs. Your ONDC-for-messaging proposal is the right architectural direction. Interoperability solves the 'network effects as moat' problem without requiring mass migration. Start with one vertical (construction contractors is a great wedge), prove the protocol works, let ecosystem diversity emerge. One addition I'd suggest: the protocol layer should include reputation/trust primitives from day one. WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption is great for privacy but terrible for platform-level spam control. A federated messaging protocol needs portable reputation that follows business identities across apps - otherwise every new entrant rebuilds spam filters from scratch and user experience suffers. The question isn't whether this gets built, but who builds it and whether it stays open. Government-backed infrastructure has different risks than VC-backed platforms. Both can succumb to capture. The governance model matters as much as the tehcnical architecture. Would love to see a follow-up on that. Recently we started building some small solutions on Whatsapp through BSP. Also use it as a primary comm channel. It’s abundantly clear the limitations of WhatsApp while even building simple stuff. And the cost of messaging has increased to 0.80 in India. With delivery rates reducing businesses will need to look for another solution like RCS. This almost mimics the path brand Facebook pages took. Organic reach used to be 100% and now it’s barely there No posts Ready for more?

Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court’s verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.” Meta, the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s strategy, “expressed in 2008: ‘It is better to buy than compete.’ True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.” During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC’s contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn’t capture the full scope of his interest in the company. The FTC’s complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and “neutralize perceived competitive threats,” just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta’s apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn’t even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it “holds center stage as Meta’s fiercest rival.” Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, “that no man can ever step into the same river twice,” Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. “The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,” he wrote. Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal’s value fell to $750 million after Facebook’s stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012. Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller “acqui-hires” — a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion. WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta’s competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple’s messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta did not immediately respond to a message for comment.

Watch CBS News November 18, 2025 / 3:05 PM EST / AP Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth. The Federal Trade Commission "continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions," Boasberg wrote in his ruling. "Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so." Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, "expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats." During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails — many of them more than a decade old — written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram. While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved "current or imminent legal violation." The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and "neutralize perceived competitive threats," just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers. Meta said Tuesday's decision "recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition." "Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America," the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement. The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case — filed in 2021 and 2022 — didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it "holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival." Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, "that no man can ever step into the same river twice," Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well. "The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down," he wrote. Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win "is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok." "But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health," she added. "Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run." Facebook bought Instagram — then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following — in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking. U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May.

The Federal Trade Commission “continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,” Boasberg wrote in his ruling. “Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now.

Title: Dow plunges 500 points on fears of AI bubble, waning hope for Fed rate cut

The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 500 points, or 1.1%, Tuesday as fears over an AI bubble shook the market and traders fretted that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve aren’t a sure thing. It was fourth straight decline for the blue-chip index and the S&P 500, which dipped 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 1.2% as investors panicked over whether AI firms have been overvalued – extending a rocky tech rout into its third week. Shares in Nvidia fell nearly 3%. The chipmaker is reporting its third-quarter results on Wednesday, toward the end of an especially upbeat earnings season. But “Magnificent 7” tech stocks have dropped amid fears that AI enthusiasm is reminiscent of the “dot-com bubble” of the 1990s and early 2000s. Amazon, Microsoft and Meta also fell. “All technology revolutions create bubble-like stock price performance – but this bubble is still inflating at a healthy pace with no signs of popping anytime soon,” James Denmert, chief investment officer at Main Street Research, said in a note Tuesday. “Valuations, while expensive, still trade at discounts to earnings growth rates and overall AI market sentiment is mildly bullish and not euphoric.” Sign up to receive On The Money by Charlie Gasparino in your inbox every Thursday.

Odds of a quarter-point cut at the Fed’s December meeting plunged to just over 50% – down from more than 90% this time last month, according to CME FedWatch, which tracks Fed Funds futures prices. Investors are looking ahead to the release of Fed minutes on Wednesday. The September jobs report, which was delayed by the government shutdown, is due out Thursday. Despite the upcoming data releases, which are key to the Fed’s decision-making process, several officials have continued to advocate for a slower rate-cutting pace. That has spooked investors who are eager for low interest rates – sending gold futures down 0.3% to $4,062 for its fourth straight day of declines. Meanwhile, Anthropic on Tuesday announced plans to buy $30 billion of Azure compute capacity from Microsoft as part of a new strategic deal. Microsoft will invest $5 billion into Anthropic, and Nvidia will give $10 billion to the startup as part of the deal. While massive AI partnerships would usually send stocks soaring, both Microsoft and Nvidia saw big losses. Anthropic is a private company. Further adding to fears of an AI bubble, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai told BBC on Tuesday that there is some “irrationality” in the current AI boom. In the case of an AI bubble bursting, “I think no company is going to be immune, including us,” Pichai said. Bitcoin dropped briefly below $90,000 on Tuesday. Many tech investors with substantial AI holdings also own cryptocurrency. By about 12:52 p.m., the cryptocurrency jumped 1.3% to $93,249.46. Shares in Home Depot plummeted 6% after the company cut its full-year profit forecast and missed earnings estimates as inflation-battered consumers hold off on renovations. While a November pullback is unusual, it could set up the stock market for a strong December and end to the year, Denmert said in his note. In the previous trading session, the 30-stock Dow fell more than 550 points, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each dropped about 0.9%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq appears on track to break its seven-month streak of gains. Advertisement

Title: Google Says New Gemini 3 AI Model Will Better Understand Your Requests

Gemini 3 is available to all users in the Gemini app, along with powering AI Mode in Google Search. Google Gemini 3 Gemini 3, the latest AI model from Google, is the company's most intelligent model to date, with more advanced multimodal and vibe coding capabilities, the company said in a blog post on Tuesday. It's available now. Google says Gemini 3 is "built to grasp depth and nuance" and is better at understanding the intent behind a user's request. The company also touted Gemini 3's multimodal capabilities, such as its ability to turn a long video lecture into interactive flash cards or to analyze a person's pickleball match and find areas for improvement. Gemini 3 isn't limited to the app. It'll also be available in AI Mode in Search and, for Pro and Ultra subscribers, in AI Overviews. In AI Overviews, Gemini 3 can generate interactive elements. Don't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source. Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis and Koray Kavukcuoglu said in a blog post that Gemini 3 Pro is less sycophantic, a problem that's been plaguing AIs and leading to AI psychosis in some. It's also more secure against prompt injection attacks, in which bad actors try to make an AI ignore its original instructions and perform unintended actions. The company also unveiled Google Antigravity, a new agentic development platform. Google says Antigravity is like having an active partner while making tools or working on projects, autonomously planning and executing complex software tasks while validating its own code. It works in tandem with Gemini 2.5's Computer Use model for browser control and works with nano banana, Gemini 2.5's image model. Gemini 3's new, more powerful, agentic capabilities will only be available to $250/month Google AI Ultra subscribers at first. This will allow the Gemini Agent to do multi-step workflows, like planning a travel itinerary. Read more: AI Essentials: 29 Ways You Can Make Gen AI Work for You, According to Our Experts Google's release of Gemini 3 comes as an AI war is heating up between it, OpenAI, Anthropic and xAI. Google's consistently been leading AI leaderboards, although other AI models haven't been far behind, sometimes trading spots at the top. With the release of Gemini 3, Google seems to be trying to solve for some of AI's more annoying problems, like hallucinations or sycophancy. It's also trying to prove that AIs can be truly agentic, being able to accomplish tasks on the user's behalf. Other agentic models have proven to be problematic in real-world usage and run into various security concerns, especially in web browsers. The latest AI release from Google also comes at a time when there are fears of an AI bubble forming in the stock market. AI companies, including Nvidia, Google, Meta and Microsoft, account for 30% of the S&P 500. Google currently has a valuation of $3.4 trillion. Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai says the trillion-dollar AI investment boom has "elements of irrationality" and that a burst would affect every AI company, he said in an interview with the BBC. Still, if Google is to keep its stock price moving upward, it needs to demonstrate that its AI models beat the competition. AI exists in Google Search currently in two ways: via AI Overviews and through AI Mode. AI Overviews is the window that appears under your search query, where a smaller AI model attempts to quickly answer your questions. AI Overviews is a separate tab in Search, alongside Images, Shopping, News and Videos that runs a more advanced model allowing users to converse with it. It's like using Gemini, but without having to go to the main Gemini website. As of now, Gemini 3 is in AI Mode, but only for those who pay for a Google AI Pro or Ultra subscription. Gemini 3 enhancements are also available in AI Overviews, but only for subscribers. Gemini 3 Pro is available in AI Mode for subscribers as well. In AI Mode, Google is touting Gemini's ability to take existing information and create bespoke UI elements. This magazine-style view will incorporate interactable widgets, images and videos. For example, if researching mortgages, Gemini can create a custom calculator to help you compare terms and savings options. Google Search uses a "fan-out" technique to pull information from across the web. With Gemini 3's advanced reasoning, Google says Search can uncover more information on the web and intelligently understand your intent.

Title: I finally went for it and bought unsupported prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard smart glasses so you don't have to. From ordering installation, here's how my experience went

Turns out, Meta's AI glasses work just fine with high-strength prescription lenses. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Of all the emerging form factors for AI, smart glasses appear to be the most promising. Many of us already wear some form of glasses daily, whether those are prescription glasses, blue-light blocking glasses, or sunglasses. Embedding smart features and AI into a product that is already a huge part of our lives sounds like a recipe for success. There's just one problem — prescription glasses-wearers, despite being likely to benefit the most from having AI on their face, are usually left out. To me, Meta makes the best smart glasses on the market, and they're ready for primetime. So, I took a leap. I spent over $500 on third-party prescription lenses for my Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard. Here's what it was like customizing Oakley Meta smart glasses with unsupported prescription lenses. I've worn prescription Oakley glasses and sunglasses for half a decade now, and I was excited when Meta announced it was bringing its smart glasses to Oakley frames. Unfortunately, the Oakley Meta HSTN didn't officially support my prescription, and the Oakley Meta Vanguard is not offered with prescription lenses. I wasn't about to give up, so I searched for third-party companies willing to make prescription lenses for Oakley Meta glasses. After months of research, I placed my first order with Lensology, a U.K. lens crafter that specializes in "click and fit" service for Meta glasses. I ordered a pretty specific lens configuration due to my prescription strength, and the color matched my Meta HSTN frames in the "Warm Gray" colorway. The ordering process with Lensology was easy, and the company takes care of all import charges, so you aren't hit with a bill when they arrive. The wait, however, was a bit lengthy. It took approximately two weeks for Lensology to manufacture my lenses, as the configuration I chose was non-stock. Then, the U.S. FDA spot-checked my lenses during the import process, further delaying them. I was told this was Lensology's first-ever FDA spot check (what luck!), and the company's customer service was responsive and helpful. Really, the delay was out of Lensology's control, and my lenses arrived roughly within a month of placing my order despite the snag. To make things right, Lensology sent another set of lenses free of charge, which passed customs immediately, confirming that this was just a fluke. I then searched for a way to wear prescription lenses with the Oakley Meta Vanguard and stumbled upon SVED Optical. The company manufactures prescription inserts for various types of sports glasses and goggles, and indeed, they have one for Vanguard. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android The experience ordering from SVED was exceptional for a few reasons. The company is based in the U.S., which simply makes things easier for a stateside buyer. The Vanguard inserts were also significantly cheaper, costing only $164 (even less with an email discount). They slot in behind the Vanguard's built-in Oakley Prizm sunglass lenses, which makes them more affordable. SVED delivered my Oakley Meta Vanguard inserts 12 days after I placed my order. That turnaround time is good enough to rival official Meta/Oakley handling speeds, if it sold Vanguard prescription lenses. I try to order straight from LensCrafters, the EssilorLuxottica-owned company Meta partners with for smart glasses, whenever possible. It costs more, but the return policy and warranties are exceptional. I like being able to walk into a store and get my situation handled immediately, and not having that with Lensology or SVED was a risk. To their credit, both brands accept mail-in returns within 30 days. When each order arrived, the quality and insertion process left me with no complaints. Putting the SVED inserts into the Meta Vanguard is so simple that anyone can do it. You remove the stock Vanguard nose piece and slip the SVED inserts into place. The prescription lenses are attached to a new nosepiece, which secures them to the Vanguard frame. I was skeptical about the added weight and how my prescription Vanguard setup would feel on my face. Surely, the lenses would rattle and scratch against the stock sunglass lenses, right? Between daily use and a 5K run, I was pleased to find that none of these were noticeable issues. The process was trickier for the Meta HSTN glasses, because you have to physically remove the stock lenses and push the prescription ones in their place. It'll be a harder process the thicker the prescription lenses. Lensology has a great instructional video on YouTube, though, and the company even records a test fit from their factory that validates the lenses fit in HSTN frames. If you have any experience changing out prescription lenses, the process is easy. Even if you don't, you'll get the hang of it quickly. The secret is to push really hard — you might think the glasses will break, but it's a necessary part of the process. Meta's AI glasses are already pricey, but adding prescription lenses through a third-party company further increases the cost of entry. There's inherent risk, even with reputable companies. You might be left at a loss if you get buyer's remorse and need to pay to ship the custom lenses back through the return process. That's why, after months of indecision, I gave SVED and Lensology a shot so you don't have to take that risk. I recommend both SVED and Lensology, and I ordered lenses from each with my own cash. If you can only pick one, I'd go with the Vanguard inserts. The cheaper price means you won't be in trouble if your prescription changes and you need a new set. On the other hand, the SVED and Vanguard combo isn't feasible for use indoors or at night. If you need clear or Transitions lenses, the Lensology and HSTN setup is the way to go. Now that I've gone through the process of putting unsupported prescription lenses in Oakley Meta HSTN and Vanguard, I think anyone on the fence should do the same. It's worth it because Meta glasses are a game-changer, and everyone should get to experience them. The best AI glasses Oakley Meta Vanguard are the best smart glasses on the market with an IP67 durability rating, a louder speaker, and a central 3K video camera. Garmin and Strava integration are the icing on the cake for fitness buffs. The standard retail versions of the Oakley Meta glasses are not typically sold with prescription lenses installed by default. While you can purchase prescription lenses for the Meta HSTN glasses, they only fall within a certain range. The Vanguard glasses do not officially support prescription lenses. The Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses support a prescription range of -6.00 to +4.00, which is the same range offered by the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. You'll first have to remove the original lenses by pushing them out from the back of the frame. You may have to push quite hard for them to pop out. Afterwards, you snap on the new lenses by pushing them into the from from the front. You must remove the nose piece from the Vanguard and replace it with the SVED nose piece insert with the lenses attached. The prescription lenses will be placed behind the Vanguard sunglass lenses.

Title: Yet More AI Bubble Worries, Now on Debt Side, with Wall Street Journal Featuring AI Datacenter Borrowing “Frenzy”

Yours truly is overdue on an overview how private-debt-backed AI datacenter deals work and why companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300 basis points extra not to do so is not a good sign. But the Wall Street Journal just published a very detailed story on the general outlines of this debt binge, which has gotten more attention in the popular press as borrowing levels have skyrocketed this year: Big Tech borrowing for AI data centers: 2015-2024 average: $32B/year Sept-Oct 2025 alone: $75B > Meta borrowed $30B > Oracle borrowed$18B > $META also did $27B off-balance sheet with Blue Owl AI companies now 14% of IG index The “money-printing” tech companies are…… pic.twitter.com/IuhBU0LS4M — junkbondinvestor (@junkbondinvest) November 5, 2025 And from the new Wall Street Journal story: What the Journal calls a “frenzy” in Wall Street Blows Past Bubble Worries to Supercharge AI Spending Frenzy is awfully reminiscent of the toxic phase of the subprime lending binge, when originators were so desperate for product, as the jibe then went, they’d fund borrower who could fog a mirror. It was years later that we were able, with the key elements including some insiders plus a remarkable pre-crisis analysis by (of all things) an equity market analyst, Henry Maxey of Ruffler Investment, to piece together how leverage-on-leverage created an even-then, well-reported “wall of liquidity”. It was also the leverage on leverage (and that systemically important yet fragile financial institutions were heavily exposed) that made the bubble unwind so catastrophic. We have warned that the unwind of an, erm, traditional credit bubble, even if very large (see Japan and for a lesser but still nasty version, the S&L crisis) typically produces at worst very deep and protracted recessions and zombification (the runup to the 1929 US crash also featured CDO-like leverage on leverage, see Frank Partnoy’s The Match King for details), as opposed to banking system near-or-actual failures. So again, we have yet to see evidence of that meteor-hitting-the-financial-system event being in the offing. But absence of evidence does not amount to evidence of absence. And perhaps finance historians can correct me, but I do not recall a historical instance of a massive equity bubble (without 1929-style heavy borrowings directly against those equities) accompanied by so many red flags, particularly operating and financial leverage, in the underlying commercial activity. That included recursive deals among key companies and as we’ll discuss a bit in this and more in posts to come, overly-clever borrowing structures that make sense only to achieve higher levels of leverage than could be achieved by traditional means. The Journal points out in passing that one of the mega-deals will pay more than 2% that a plainer-vanilla offering would. In a fine overview of in June on how these financings work, Paul Kedrosky similarly said the premium was 200 to 300 basis points. That’s an awful lot to pay for opacity and supposed balance sheet remoteness.1 As a brief introduction to causes for concern about the datacenter boom, see the executive summary from Bubble or Nothing from the Center for Public Enterprise (hat tip Matt Stoller): ● Cash flow uncertainty persists as the cost of providing AI inference services continues to rise. Leading AI inference service providers are not particularly differentiated from one another; this competitive market structure suppresses market participants’ pricing power and prevents them from recovering rising costs. ● The collateral value of a graphical processing unit (GPU), the sector’s keystone asset, looks poised to fall in the near-term. The value of chips fluctuates depending on uncertain user demand as well as the supply dynamics and technical specifications of new GPUs, now released yearly. The cash flow that GPU collateral can demand is suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure and the uncertain depreciation schedule of existing GPUs. ● Data center tenants will undertake multiple cycles of intense and increasingly expensive capital expenditure within a single lease term, posing considerable tenant churn risks to data center developers. This asset-liability mismatch between data center developers and their tenants will strain developers’ creditworthiness without guarantees from market-leading tech companies. ● Circular financing, or “roundabouting,” among so-called hyperscaler tenants—the leading tech companies and AI service providers—create an interlocking liability structure across the sector. These tenants comprise an incredibly large share of the market and are financing each others’ expansion, creating concentration risks for lenders and shareholders. ● Debt is playing an increasingly large role in the financing of data centers. While debt is a quotidian aspect of project finance, and while it seems like hyperscaler tech companies can self-finance their growth through equity and cash, the lack of transparency in some recent debt-financed transactions and the interlocked liability structure of the sector are cause for concern. The first two points alone, the fact that inference costs are not only not falling but still rising, and near-term downside in GPU prices ought to be fatal, or at least detrimental to debt funding. Yet as you’ll see, even though the Journal raises concerns, and even adds to this list by describing how AI “hyperscalers” are putting out duplicate orders for the datacenter capacity, virtually assuring whipsaw, it’s not as sobering as the list above. But it includes signs that some dogs are turning their noses up at the dogfood: Stock prices normally go up when a company reports record revenue but after Meta did just that on Oct. 29, its shares plummeted 11% instead. The reason: Zuckerberg disclosed he will “aggressively” increase capital spending on AI, drawing questions from analysts about how the company plans to actually make money off the new technology. What the Journal describes parallels the late-stage subprime lending frenzy. In 2007, CEO Chuck Prince of later-big-bailout recipient Citigroup famously remarked: When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated. “But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance. We’re still dancing….The depth of the pools of liquidity is so much larger than it used to be that a disruptive event now needs to be much more disruptive than it used to be. Consider from the Journal the, erm, enthusiasm of lenders and fears of becoming wall flowers in this party: Silicon Valley’s biggest players are flush with cash and were able to fund much of the initial AI build-out from their own coffers. As the dollar figures climb ever higher, they are turning to debt and private equity—spreading the risks and potential rewards more broadly across the economy. Some of the financing is coming from plain-vanilla corporate bond sales, but financiers are making far bigger fees off giant private deals. Virtually every Wall Street player is angling to get a piece of the action, from banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley to traditional asset managers such as BlackRock. Investor appetite for data-center debt is so strong that some money managers have booked billion-dollar gains in a matter of days, even before construction of the facilities they are financing is complete. Still, the longer-term performance is hardly assured. Big tech companies are expected to spend nearly $3 trillion on AI through 2028 but only generate enough cash to cover half that tab, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley. Big names in the financial world, such as Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, are warning about AI-fueled froth in the markets and in capital spending. At the same time, the fear of missing out is real. Days after Solomon voiced his concerns to analysts, Goldman formed a new team in its banking and markets group focused on AI infrastructure financing. Later from the Journal: Funds that invest in AI deals say they carry little risk, because tech companies with deep pockets have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back. Microsoft has a higher credit rating than the U.S. government, and it told investors on Oct. 29 that it would double its total data-center footprint in the next two years. Perhaps I am too old, but I recall that IBM and GE were once AAA rated too, and that by 2000 (for IBM) and 2010 (for GE) their luster had taken quite a turn. And remember the pre-crisis pattern that housing prices had never fallen nationwide, only regionally? These supposedly blue-chip tech companies are placing monster bets on AI, so their historical solidity isn’t as germane as it might seem, unless they back off if the fundamental performance of large language models continues to fall well short of promises. The reaction of the Meta stockholders to Zuckerberg’s promise of even more big AI spending is confirmation. Back to the Journal: Tech executives see more risk in underbuilding than overbuilding… But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… The last time Wall Street went all-in on an industry was the fracking boom—then bust—over a decade ago. This time, financiers are marshaling even larger sums. The article continues with a breathless account of the boomtown effect that these datacenter buildouts are generating. Matt Stoller flagged the concern of growing real-economy dependence on massive spend in what ought to be a niche: A few months ago, I asked why our economy, despite steady growth in official numbers, feels so creepy and unstable. My conclusion was that the U.S. is in a “Chinese finger trap” economy. We are dependent for growth on monopolies and an AI bubble, which juices the all-important stock market. Trying to grow an economy in a more stable way could lower stock prices which would paradoxically lead to a downturn. So we’re stuck, until some outside event occurs…. Data center developers are now approaching multiple utilities with proposals for the same project, leading to “phantom” forecasts of demand that isn’t actually there. Essentially, it’s hoarding. Hoarding is what happen in overheated markets….But this can lead to something called the “bullwhip effect.” Buyers overstate how much they want to buy….all of a sudden the demand evaporates because it was never real in the first place. This dynamic can throw an economy into an overheated state, and then a depression; that’s what happened globally after World War I, leading to, among other things, Mussolini’s takeover of Italy…. At this point, data centers are pretty much what’s growing in America. I recently had a conversation with an elected official who told me that data center construction is a huge construction jobs boost in rust belt areas….He posited a tension between political support for the new temporary jobs and political anger over higher electricity prices. We have a one-legged economy, with the AI build-out serving as a driver of real estate values, the stock market, and GDP growth This is a bet-the-economy scheme on models where China has much better mousetraps. There is no way this will end well. ____ 1 The crisis demonstrated that theory and practice can be two different things. Banks had long offloaded credit card receivables to investors in supposedly off-balance sheet deals. When losses on them rose to previously unthinkable levels, the investors successfully revolted and made the banks eat some of those costs. The reason was the bank credit card businesses depended on being able to keep using other people’s credit. I am not sure whether or not these AI datacenter borrowers won’t wind up in an analogous position, of being so dependent on ongoing lending that lenders won’t let them walk away from outsized credit losses. “companies like Meta who are perfectly capable of borrowing in their own name paying 200-300% basis points extra” Yves, I noticed something that should be fixed: “% basis points”. Incompatible units, right? Aargh, fixing, thanks. “…have ironclad leases that will generate the money to pay investors back.” Bwaahhh!!! That is until those leases hit the smelters of the bankruptcy courts! Ed Dowd on the US economic, the AI bubble, the stock market, and the housing market. utube, ~1 hr. Ed Dowd: We’re Already in a Recession, Oil Going to $30 & The Deflation Scare Coming https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHM-BH-SguE Excellent discussion and economic assessments by Dowd. These are Capitalists to the core. Meta and much of big tech still have corporate stock buyback plans open. Incentives drive outcomes—-companies have move incentive to lever-up and chase the AI headlines than being seen as a 1989-era IBM (a company missing a secular pivot). “…China has much better mousetraps.” Listened recently to an interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin on this topic taking much the same line as the above article, during which he claimed as an example of China’s technical and manufacturing prowess that BYD electric vehicles are the gold standard that are better and cheaper than U.S. cars and that if the U.S. didn’t have tariffs on Chinese cars we would probably not have and an auto industry in the U.S. I’m giving serious consideration to encouraging my USian grandchildren to learn Mandarin, https://www.newyorker.com/video/watch/the-radio-hour-andrew-ross-sorkin-in-conversation-with-andrew-ross-sorkin (Minute 12:33) When you’ve lost Andrew Ross Sorkin… I saw a video on the YouTube’s last night so it must be true… BYD just test drove, (introduced?) an EV that will reach speeds over 200 miles an hour. I think they were at 300+ mph Believe it o not, an electric motor can generate enormous rotational torque. Combustion engines are no match. Getting to 200-300 mph is more a matter of stability and aerodynamics. Too many EV’s on a US freeway will create the same congestion as an ICE vehicle. I’ve driven and owned a number of ICE muscle cars, mostly during my misspent youth, that I found impressively fast off the line. Now I drive a little Toyota hybrid, which frankly feels a bit like riding around in a sardine can, that upon acceleration can give you whiplash. I exaggerate but slightly. Believe it or not, torque can not be anything but rotational. :) “Linear torque” is force. Also, torque can be multiplied via gears, while power can’t. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, which is the “believe it or not” part for ICE only drivers (with diesel engines being better at low rpm torque than petrol ones). Limited range of rotational speeds with useful torque is why trasmission is a necessity (and also why big trucks have more gears). Getting to 200-300 mph is a matter of many things, but mostly not crashing. :) Son in law just received his Tesla cyber truck. He loves it, so far. We talked about the almost instant high torque etc. Tech features are great! Run everything from the smart phone. My nephew has had the EV Rivian pick-up for a couple of years he still loves it. I saw it Saturday! I hope my daughter stops calling their cyber truck the “dumpster”. At 75 I’ll stay with the ICE-SUV. My one-owner 1977 Chevrolet Cabriolet, with second 305 V8, 270.000 miles, low rev – high torque, runs like new. A random professional-American’s Mandarin will never be good as their random Chinese equivalent’s English. Particularly as English is the de-facto international working language in Asia, which is much more linguistically diverse than Europe’s Proto-Indo-European-descendant languages. Don’t push Mandarin just because of China in a vacuum (though obviously the thought counts). China isn’t just Mandarin, it’s a civilizational tradition that evolved independently of the west’s Greco-Roman-Enlightenment lineage—-an obvious statement, but something that’s lost on lots of credentialed, supposedly educated, people. And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history. “And today’s “Communist China” is just one page in its lengthy history.” Truly. The pages that have for the most part drawn my interest over the years are those having to do with the development of Buddhism in that country. One thing in particular that strikes me is that the Chinese took the more asocial natural mysticism of India and Southeast Asia and made it more fit for purpose in a materially practical, more socially engaged way of living. Yes, I communicate with Chinese entrepreneurs and their English is as good or better than lifelong Americans. I’m told their linguistic skill is not unusual. I just started listening to an audiobook “Empire of AI”. One line of thinking in the book is that “size/scale/compute power” is not the only infrastructure model one can choose from to chase the elusive AGI unicorn (another topic the book explores). This is the predominant line of thinking running thru SV though. Open AI seized the narrative and strategically decided to achieve AGI thru sheer scale and size of its compute resources. 3 hours into the book so far but its very interesting. Thanks for the book tip. I’m currently reading Adam Becker’s More Everything Forever describing beliefs and intentions prevalent among Silicon Valley elites. “Inmates running the asylum” is a phrase that comes to mind. And not in a good way as in King of Hearts. $133B in questionable debt? Just file it under “other.” Here we have JP Morgan blazing the opacity trail. Thanks for this background, Yves. To me, this finance perspective confirms some things I think about AI and data centers. An example from a portion of the Journal article you quote: But some tech companies are weaker financially than others. Oracle…needs to borrow billions more for its spending spree, prompting Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings to edge closer to reclassifying Oracle’s bonds as junk debt. In recent weeks, the company’s stock price has fallen 32% and its bonds have lost about 7%. Why risk so much? Hasn’t stock price been sacred in the post-Greenspan era? Doesn’t this seem to be about more than even money? I think I’ve found part of the answer in two interviews Ross Douthat, the Roman Catholic New York Times columnist, has done in the past year. The first, Douthat’s interview of Peter Thiel is second perhaps only to Tucker’s sit-down with Nick Fuentes among widely viewed videos. The second one, done in the past few days, is of Paul Kingsnorth, who’s on a book tour promoting his new book, Against the Machine: The Unmaking of Humanity. I was introduced to Kingsnorth through amfortas’s links to the Dark Mountain Project, which was begun by Kingsnorth and Dougald Hine. I recommend listening to the Thiel interview before the Kingsnorth one because Douthat and Kingsnorth discuss that interview at some length. It’s also interesting contrast the two interviewees’ personalities and characters. (Kingsnorth calls the projects of Thiel and Musk “little boys’ toys,” an example of his barely contained contempt for them.) I have watched about 15min of the first interview and paused at about 15 min of the second and, whatever one thinks about Kingsnorth he can be labelled as freethinker while Thiel not. The later is heavily influenced by his attachments (to his companies, money, whatever he is attached to) no matter how much he would like to appear as a freethinker. I couldn’t stomach Thiel for longer while I will probably end Kingsnorth interview even if i do not agree completely with him in some instances but he is much more interesting than Thiel. One shakes the brain and the other shakes the stomach. Let me recommend the latest interview of Emmanuel Todd by Glenn Diesen which I found interesting. This are people who shake one beliefs and that is good. Agree with Ignacio about Diesen’s interview of Todd. For once, Diesen pretty much shut up & let Todd talk. Todds latest book is about the loss of the West. He gets heavily into the loss of the philosophical “center” of the West- sort of there being no there there. He says that Western society has become a “Zombie” society like the Nazis. Well worth the listen! Like this: from 2024, In view of this, ladies and gentlemen, what we can conclude is that the adoration of transvestites is an inevitable consequence of liberalism, and that the Inquisition burned too few people. I will not venture into the twisted nest of vipers that is Thiel’s brain, but Kingsnorth will be worth a listen, thanks. I’m meeting with my Minnesota AI vs. water people tomorrow. It’ll be interesting to hear their perspective. Data centers might try to propose one project to competing power companies but there’s only one water source (and regulator). If the volume of permit amendment applications from water utilitues/cities has fallen (data centers in MN do not supply their own water), the number of data center projects in MN will have fallen proportionally. I’m trying to think about what’s similar and different with dotcom. 1) Similar to AI, dotcom had a huge infra build-out of core network fiber, switching, and data centers. Not all of that was scrap as some of it has relatively long useful life, especially fiber and switching, unlike AI GPUs. 2) The demand for dotcom infra was real, growing, and continues to grow. The dotcom bubble was supply. The Inernet as such was not vaporware. In AI it’s not clear how much money there really is in psychopathic search engines and generation of videos of dogs with 5 legs. A lot of the ultimate “demand” may be hype. 3) As Yves so well presents above, the financials of the AI bubble may involve a lot more leverage than dotcom. So what are we facing? Something worse than dotcom but not worse than GFC? The public Internet in the 90’s was not vaporware. It was the long developing son of the military/university ARPANET (network) from the 70’s. The early Internet was communication over phone lines. As public access grew cable/fiber optics were seen as necessary to get increased public/business participation. Unfortunately, laying cable was faster than public uptake. Until. of course, Netscape, and other graphical user interface that didn’t require knowledge of computer programming. Then, with exploding popularity (ease of use), the Internet demanded cable and fiber connectivity. Something tells me AGI is not going to follow this breakout scenario. Yea GUI, and they said no one would pay those hundreds of dollars for that heavy CRT. On #2. you are GREATLY confusing dotcom infrastructure with companies selling “eyeballs’. Most of the bubble was in the latter. There’s also the risk that the chips tech firms are borrowing to buy could be obsolete in a few year… Leaving aside for the moment the overall ridiculous nature of the AI technology boom and the fact that it is going to come crashing down of its own accord quite soon since LLVMs are not fit for their advertised purpose, any above quote seems like it highlights another risk-within-a-risk. GPUs are a very high technology product that most people don’t know much about beyond a few acronyms. Using them as debt collateral seems very fraught in its own right since no one knows enough about them to decide what they are worth and in particular how quickly they’re going to depreciate. Nvidia recently announced that they are going to a one-year design cycle, meaning all the chips that were purchased in 2025 will be superseded by newer, more powerful chips in 2026, and so on each year. I imagine this will create a big hit to the older models, and I imagine after this happens a few times the older chips will be essentially worthless. I don’t know what the term of the debt is that is being backed by these chips, but if it’s more than a couple of years this is obviously a shipwreck waiting to happen. There are other changes in the technological landscape that can also render existing GPU hardware worthless in one way or another, including changes in software architecture and new manufacturers coming on the scene with cheaper and more powerful products. These kinds of things are both hard to predict and reasonably likely to happen. Some physical objects, like real estate, vehicles, precious gems, and so on seem to make fairly reasonable collateral (even so, look at the record!), but new and evolving integrated circuits of very high density and complexity don’t fit into that category. 1. I am yet to hear of significant proposals stateside to expand electric generation capacity – plus transmission lines – to support all this projected data center growth. And remember, the US is a fragmented electricity space (10 separate market regions in just the lower 48), with differing regulatory rules (Texas does not equal New York does not equal California), so these need to be done at the local level. The Russians have publically talked about using the new modular type nuclear reactors (including the ones they’d developed for the Burevestnik and the Poseidon weapons), though for now data centers do not seem at the top of their energy or nuke priorities (they’re replacing their aging nukes plus upgrading the infrastructure in historically underserved regions like Yakutia). The Chinese are drastically increasing their nuke capacity, paying the Russians a healthy chunk so to do. The Americans……….eh? Or maybe I’ve just missed it. But all these plans for data center buildouts without the generation and transmission to go with are bound to run into quite the obstacle once they start drawing enough power to drop a given market region below its “reserve margin” level (typically 12% over peak demand is how much you want in generation), or, if god forbid these idiots build them in Texas, which is the only fully deregulated market, cause “ice storm” level price spikes for customers. 2. I am not sure what you would use as collateral if you’re doing any secured or ABS type financing for these data centers. The buildings themselves? Because here’s the thing. If the servers are meant to do AI-LLM type stuff, that means every year, when the new chips/GPUs come out, you have to upgrade them all, at huge cost. But meanwhile, standard data center tasks do not need this extra capacity and do not need this extra bang for the buck. So 1-2-3 years into the deal you’re stuck with a bunch of formerly high-end chips that no-one needs, unless you pile even more money into the place? Or think about it this way. Whenever I build my own PC, instead of buying the latest, most high-end CPU and video card, I buy the ones from ~2 years ago. Because at that point the price comes down 50% or more, while the decline in capability – for home user applications – is fairly negligible. The point is, the depreciation on these assets is insane relative to, say, a commercial building, or a power plant, or a refinery or whatever. Or even a commercial aircraft (assumed 25-year useful life, usually). To do an ABS deal secured by chips, if that is, in fact, what they are doing…that is pure insanity. 3. Does anyone remember IBM’s Watson? Their whole thing in the 2000s and early-mid 2010s was – we have this “artificial intelligence” thing called Watson, and we’ll sell it to hospitals and such, where it will make diagnoses and help (read: replace) the medical staff in this and that capacity. And…the whole thing failed, because they could not fix what we now call AI hallucinations. Or, rather, IBM tinkered around with it for a while, with some sample projects in this or that hospital that never went anywhere much, and eventually sold it to some PE guys for ~$1 billion, which is rather less than they’d invested into it in the first place. Of course, the total cost for Watson, at least its medical unit, including all the R&D and whatnot, had to have been in the several billion range at the most, which is something IBM can easily afford. I look at the charts for projected LLM capex spend, and there is just no way to get there from here, unless there is a technological revolution in LLMs no-one knows about. Re #2, the security is the data center lease agreements. I seldom comment on tech since I stopped working in that field 25 years ago, and I deliberately do not use hardware or software services provided by AI, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, etc. Nevertheless, I am typing this on an ancient computer running Linux, which I deliberately configured to run minimal unbloated software, and I realize I need to build a new computer from parts because using my ancient parts is getting too risky. I remember 30 years ago when I eagerly anticipated the weekend edition of the newspaper with the weekend Fry’s Electronics ad. Holy moley! There’s a CPU and ATX motherboard combo for $120. I’m getting it. Without hesitation, I would drive there (or get my dad to drive) and immediately splurge. Then, I got right to work assembling my new computer. Wow, how times have changed for me. I gave you this background to discuss how I have since fallen on hard times, how frugal I am, and how RAM prices have recently soared. Apparently, this happened because of the AI bubble encouraging RAM manufacturers to divert their resources away from desktop computer memory and components on RAM modules to continue feeding the AI bubble. Because I am not too knowledgeable about this, let me link to the Hardware Unboxed videos “DDR5 Pricing Skyrockets, What’s Going On?” and “VRAM Cost Is About To Make GPUs Way More Expensive“. I have been dreaming about buying new parts for a new computer for 6-12 months now. One year ago a 2×16 GB package of DDR5 RAM was approximately $100 USD. Today, that could be well over $200. That difference is enough to discourage me from buying. Three companies dominate the market for memory: Samsung, Micron, and Hynix. The AI bubble seems to have affected all three companies and respective prices for RAM. Of course, I could try to skimp in other areas. I didn’t pay attention to computers for a decade or more. Thus, I got up to speed recently in anticipation of any supposed Black Friday promotions. Apparently, Intel makes garbage chips now. That leaves one other option, AMD. AMD’s latest and greatest platform is named AM5 (with AM6 forthcoming), but I could deliberately buy an AM4 CPU, AM4 motherboard, and DDR4 RAM. DDR4 RAM did not get excluded from whatever frothiness is going on with AI. It’s all kind of spendy. Argh! Risk to the big 7 paying off these debts: Trump fails to prevent China’s DeepSeek from dominating Sam Altman’s too much computer, too much training overhead. Big 7 intro/monopoly power already gone. Data center build outs delayed by grid connection, if the grid can get debt to build out. Project and supply chain delays. Some number of US/EU sources doing programming like DeepSeek. If big 7 make any profit it will be short lived. HE/SW life cycle very short. Any underwriter not following scientific papers is not doing due diligence. But, the fed balance sheet has over $2.5 trillion in MBS, etc. Most with >10 years left. Might as well tranche the big 7 debts and move on. Buckle up! Reuters just reported CDS’ are being drawn up on big AI risk. Weinstein, Saba…. Is this the report you mean? https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/weinsteins-saba-sells-credit-derivatives-big-tech-as-ai-risks-grow-source-says-2025-11-17/ Boaz Weinstein’s Saba Capital Management has sold credit derivatives in recent months to lenders seeking protection on big tech names like Oracle and Microsoft due to concerns over a debt-financed AI investment frenzy, a source told Reuters. Banks have sought to shield their exposure to potential losses by buying credit default swaps (CDS) from the U.S. hedge fund manager, known for his winning bet against the JPMorgan Chase, opens new tab trader dubbed the “London Whale”, the person said. While the credit insurance rises in value in tandem with the perceived risk of a company’s default, current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors. Yes, thank you for linking it here…. “current prices indicate those risks are still low compared to other sectors.” is a stretch! Jensen Huang says NVDA will sell $500 to $600 billion in GPU chips next couple of years…. where will the money come from? i dont really believe in the ability of companies to supply data centers with enough electricity in the long run. thus in my mind, the fate of data centers many years down the line is likely some sort of looting for parts – if not electrical components, then the base metals used in the electrical components. additionally, the oversupply of datacenters begs another question: what about the data? how are they getting enough data to compute in these centers? you need either more experimental data being gathered (phones, surveillance, maybe drones) or something from ab initio guys. Jeff Bezos has entered the chat… I think this is becoming as silly as the original Dot Com bubble. According to the Guardian article you linked, so has Michael Burry. Michael Burry, best known for accurately predicting the 2008 housing crisis, recently invested $1bn in bets that Palantir and Nvidia shares will fall just days after he accused some of the big tech firms of using accounting tricks to “artificially boost earnings”. Thanks for posting this article. I’m still trying to digest it all. I think this is related – has anybody noticed what’s happening to RAM? Prices are going nuts: RAM: WTF? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hLiwNViMak A memory upgrade that I was looking at earlier this year for around $120 is now approaching $500. I don’t know if this will bleed into prices for other devices that use RAM and other ICs used in server grade hardware, but if this keeps up, it will. All so we can have things like AI targeted data scrapping and ads, lay off entry level workers of all sorts, and OpenAI’s big deal – AI p0rn. Really? Yeah, really: OpenAI’s ChatGPT will soon allow ‘erotica’ for adults in major policy shift https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/15/erotica-coming-to-chatgpt-this-year-says-openai-ceo-sam-altman.html China is using AI to do things like reduce the cost of healthcare and enhance manufacturing (I think this is a repeat link): China’s AI hospitals will transform medicine across the world. But not in the United States. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmFB7AQSR0 I’ll have to keep looking around at how AI will be used in America hoping to find where it will be used to assist humans doing jobs – I’m sure it’s out there rather than all the crazy AI stuff that actually pops up unwanted. AI friends for kids? Yikes! NO! I’ve come across a couple of instances where medical researchers in the U.S. are using AI. In one they’re attempting to discover possible cures to various diseases through the off-label use of existing medications. The Medical Matchmaking Machine Radiolab (1 hour, 12 minute audio). This is quite a story as the principal researcher was a doctor who, without AI, discovered an off-label use for an existing medication to save his own life and that of others. Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Science Friday (18 minute audio with transcript) Thanks! Other researchers are using AI to develop new drugs without much success as of yet. AI Was Supposed To Discover New Drugs. Where Are They? Years of human trials and millions or billions of dollars of investment will happen before the AI- discovered candidate molecules — and I know of plenty — which make it through the process will arrive. That’s how the real world works. New drugs don’t just magically appear. Both these podcast transcripts eventually get to that little fact, so the headline/titles of them are essentially clickbait.
