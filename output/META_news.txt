UPDATED 16:58 EST / JANUARY 10 2026 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante and David Floyer At CES 2026, Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang once again reset the economics of artificial intelligence factories. In particular, despite recent industry narratives that Nvidia’s moat is eroding, our assessment is the company has further solidified its position as the hardware and software standard for the next generation of computing. In the same way Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. dominated the Moore’s Law era, we believe Nvidia will be the mainspring of tech innovation for the foreseeable future. Importantly, the previous era saw a doubling of performance every two years. Today Nvidia is driving annual performance improvements of five times, throughput of 10 times, and driving token demand of 15 times via Jevons Paradox. The bottom line is that ecosystem players and customers must align with this new paradigm or risk a fate similar to that of Sisyphus, the beleaguered figure who perpetually pushed a rock up the mountain. In this Breaking Analysis, we build on our prior work from Episode 300 with an update to our thinking. We begin with an historical view, examining the fate of companies that challenged Intel during the personal computer era and the characteristics that allowed a small number of them to survive and ultimately succeed. From there, we turn to the announcements Huang (pictured) made at CES and explain why they materially change the economics of AI factories. In our view, these developments are critical to understanding the evolving demand dynamics around performance, throughput and utilization in large-scale AI infrastructure. We close by examining the implications across the ecosystem. What does this mean for competitors such as Intel, Broadcom Inc., Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and other silicon specialists? How should hyperscalers, leading AI research labs, original equipment manufacturers and enterprise customers think about AI strategy, capital allocation and spending priorities in light of these shifts? Let’s begin with a historical view, looking back at the companies that challenged Intel during the 1980s and 1990s. IBM was the dominant force early on, but it was far from the only player that attempted to compete at the silicon level. A long list of RISC vendors and alternative architectures emerged during that period – including Sun Microsystems Inc. – many of which are now footnotes in computing history. The slide above highlights this reality. The companies shown in green are the ones that managed to make it through the knothole. The rest did not. The central reason comes down to the fact that Intel delivered relentless consistency with predictable, sustained improvement in performance and price-performance, roughly doubling every two years. Intel never took its foot off the pedal. It executed Moore’s Law as an operational discipline as well as a technology roadmap. As a result, competitors simply could not keep pace. Even strong architectural ideas from industry leaders were overwhelmed by Intel’s scale, manufacturing advantage, volume economics and cadence. One point worth noting. Apple, while not always viewed as a direct silicon competitor during that era, ultimately won by controlling its system architecture and, later, by vertically integrating its silicon strategy. The broader takeaway is fundamental in our assumptions for the rest of this analysis. Specifically, in platform markets driven by learning curves, volume and compounding economics, dominance is not just about having a great product. Success requires sustained momentum over long periods of time, while competitors exhaust themselves trying to catch up. Let’s now double down on the companies that actually survived the Intel-dominated PC era. The list below is instructive in our view. AMD, Acorn (the original Arm), Apple Inc., Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Intel and Nvidia. Each followed a different path, but they share a common underlying characteristic which is volume. AMD’s survival traces directly back to IBM’s original PC strategy. IBM mandated a second-source supplier, forcing Intel to share its instruction sets. AMD became that second source, and no other company gained comparable access. That structural advantage persisted for decades and allowed AMD to remain viable long after other x86 challengers disappeared. ARM, TSMC and Apple fundamentally changed the prevailing belief – stated by AMD CEO Jerry Sanders— that “real men own fabs.” These companies proved that separating design from manufacturing could be a winning strategy. Apple brought massive system-level volume. TSMC rode that volume to drive down costs, ultimately achieving manufacturing economics that we estimate to be roughly 30% lower than Intel’s. Nvidia followed a similar fabless path, pairing architectural leadership with accelerating demand. Intel itself was the original volume powerhouse, benefiting from the virtuous cycle created by the Wintel combination. That volume allowed Intel to outlast RISC competitors and dominate the PC era. But in the current cycle, Intel has lost ground to Arm-based designs, Nvidia and TSMC – each of which now rides on steeper learning curves. The takeaway is that volume is volume is fundamental to dominance. Not just volume in a single narrow segment, but volume across adjacent and synergistic markets that feed the same learning curves. AMD’s volume was initially forced by IBM’s PC division mandating a second source to Intel. Apple’s volume is consumer-driven. TSMC’s volume is manufacturing-led. Nvidia’s volume is now accelerating faster than any of them in this era. In our view, Nvidia is positioned to be the dominant volume leader of the AI era by a wide margin. And as history shows, once volume leadership is established at scale, it becomes extraordinarily difficult for competitors to catch up without other factors affecting the outcome (e.g. self-inflicted wounds or things out of the leader’s control such as geopolitical shifts). Nvidia’s CES announcements were visionary and focused largely on the emerging robotics market. In this analysis, however, we focused in on the core of Nvidia’s systems business. In our view, what Nvidia announced in this regard exceeded even our optimistic expectations. As we’ve stressed often, Nvidia is remarkable, not only because of a single chip, but because of the scope of what it delivers. Specifically, Huang led this part of his keynote with a six-chip, full-system redesign built around what Huang consistently refers to as extreme co-design. The chart above shows the next generation innovations from Nvidia, including Vera Rubin, named in homage to the astronomer whose work on galactic rotation curves led to the discovery of dark matter. Vera is the CPU. Rubin is the GPU. But focusing only on those two components misses the broader story. Nvidia simultaneously advanced every major silicon element in the system including NVLink based on InfiniBand, ConnectX nics and Spectrum-X for Ethernet, BlueField DPUs and Spectrum-X Ethernet with co-packaged optics. A few years ago, the prevailing narrative suggested that Ethernet would undercut Nvidia’s proprietary networking position, the underpinning which was Infiniband (via the Covid-era Mellanox acquisition). Nvidia was undeterred and responded by building Spectrum-X. Today, Jensen Huang argues that Nvidia is the largest networking company in the world by revenue, and the claim appears credible. What’s striking is not the line extension itself, but the speed and completeness with which Nvidia executed it. The deeper point lies in how Nvidia defines co-design. While the company works closely with customers such as OpenAI Group PBC, Google LLC with Gemini and xAI Corp., the co-design begins internally – across Nvidia’s own portfolio. This generation represents a ground-up redesign of the entire machine. Every major chip has been enhanced in coordination, not in isolation. The performance metrics are astounding. The GPU delivers roughly a fivefold performance improvement. The CPUs see substantial gains as well. But equally important are the advances in networking – both within the rack and across racks. Each subsystem was redesigned together to maximize end-to-end throughput rather than optimize any single component in isolation. The result is multiplicative, not additive. While individual elements show performance gains on the order of five times, the system-level throughput improvement is closer to an order of magnitude. That is the payoff of extreme co-design – aligning compute, networking, memory and software to minimize single bottlenecks that limit the overall system. In our view, this marks a decisive shift in how AI infrastructure is built. For quite some time we’ve acknowledged that Nvidia is no longer shipping chips. It is delivering tightly integrated systems engineered to maximize throughput, utilization, and economic efficiency at the scale required for AI factories. That distinction is profound as competitors attempt to match not just component performance, but the learning-curve advantages that emerge when volume, architecture and system-level design reinforce each other. While Jensen has pointed out that Nvidia is a full systems player, the point is often lost on investors and market watchers. This announcement further underscores the importance of this design philosophy and further differentiates Nvidia from any competitor. A critical point that becomes more clear from Nvidia’s announcements is the chip is not the correct unit of measurement. The system is. More precisely, the rack – and ultimately the token output per rack – is what defines performance, economics, and value. Each rack integrates 72 GPUs along with CPUs and high-speed interconnects that bind the system together. Compute density is critical, but so is the ability to move data with minimal jitter and maximum consistency – within the rack, across racks, and across entire frames. Nvidia has dramatically increased memory capacity into the terabytes, enabling GPUs to operate in tight coordination without stalling. The result is coherent execution at massive scale. These systems are designed to scale up, scale out, and scale across. When deployed at full factory scale, they operate not in dozens or hundreds of GPUs, but in hundreds of thousands – eventually up to a million GPUs working together. As scale increases, so does throughput. And as throughput increases, the economic value of the tokens generated accelerates. This is where the numbers compound to create the flywheel effect. Roughly five times performance improvement at the component level combines with roughly ten times throughput at the system level. Together, they drive what we believe is an estimated 15-times increase in demand, as lower cost per token unlocks entirely new classes of workloads. This is Moore’s Law on triple steroids – and it explains why annual value creation rises so sharply. The Jevons Paradox applies here. As the efficiency of token generation improves, total consumption rises. As we’ve stressed, the value shifts away from static measures of chip performance, toward dynamic measures of system utilization and output economics. The faster tokens can be generated, the more economically viable it becomes to deploy AI at scale, and the more demand expands. Networking is central to this equation. Nvidia’s long-term investment in Mellanox – once dismissed by many as a bet on a dying technology – now looks prescient. InfiniBand continues to grow rapidly, even as Ethernet demand also accelerates. Far from being a bottleneck, networking has become a core enabler of system-level performance. The takeaway is that AI infrastructure economics are now defined at the rack and factory level, not at the chip level. Nvidia’s advantage lies in designing systems where compute, memory, networking and software operate as a single, tightly coordinated machine. That is where throughput is maximized, token economics are transformed, and the next phase of AI factory value is being created. Huang presented three critical metrics on a single slide to show training throughput, AI factory token throughput and token cost. Together, they tell a story about where AI infrastructure economics are headed. For clarity, we break this into two parts as shown below: training on the left, factory and inference throughput on the right. The training chart shows time-to-train measured in months for a next-generation, ultra-large model. The takeaway is eye opening. The Rubin platform reaches the same training throughput as Blackwell using roughly one quarter of the GPUs. As we pointed out earlier, this is not simply about faster chips. It reflects dramatic gains in efficiency at scale – reduced synchronization overhead, fewer memory stalls, lower fabric contention, and shorter training cycles overall. The implications are notable. Capital required per model run drops materially. Customers can run more experiments per year and iterate faster. Training velocity becomes a competitive advantage in itself, not just a cost consideration. In our view, this is one of the most under-appreciated dynamics in the current AI race. The factory throughput chart above on the right, tells an equally important story. As workloads shift from batch inference toward interactive, agent-driven use cases, throughput characteristics change dramatically. Tokens per query increase. Latency sensitivity rises. Under these conditions, Blackwell’s throughput collapses as shown. Meanwhile, Rubin sustains performance far more effectively and delivers approximately 10 times more tokens per month at the factory level. This is the future workload profile of AI factories – real-time, interactive, agentic and highly variable — not static batch inference. Rubin is designed for this moment. The value is not just in peak performance, but in sustained throughput under real-world conditions. Taken together, these charts explain why Nvidia’s advantage continues to widen. Training and inference are converging in economic importance. Faster training reduces capital intensity and accelerates innovation. Higher factory throughput lowers token costs while expanding demand. This combination resets expectations for performance, efficiency and scalability. In our view, many observers continue to underestimate both the pace at which Nvidia is moving and the magnitude of the gap it is creating. Comparisons to alternative accelerators – whether Google TPUs, AWS Trainium or others – miss the system-level reality being demonstrated by Nvidia. The new standard is not raw compute. It is training velocity, sustained factory throughput and token economics at scale. And on those dimensions, Nvidia is setting the bar. The final piece of the equation that we’ll dig into is cost. And this is where the implications become overwhelming. In our view, it’s what matters most. The combination of higher throughput and system-level efficiency drives cost per token down by roughly an order of magnitude. Huang framed it in his keynote saying these systems may consume more power, but they do vastly more work. When throughput rises by 10 times and cost per token falls to one-10th, the economic profile of AI factories fundamentally resets. What’s striking is the pace. This is not the 18- to 24-month cadence historically associated with Moore’s Law. These gains are occurring on a 12-month cycle. Moore’s Law transformed the computing industry for decades, lifting productivity across silicon, software, storage, infrastructure and applications. What we are seeing now is an even more aggressive curve – orders-of-magnitude improvement compressed into a single year. There are real pressures behind this progress. Demand for advanced chips, memory and interconnects is intense, pushing up component costs. Nvidia has secured premium access across that supply chain. But from the perspective of an AI factory operator, the math dominates everything else. If cost per token falls while throughput rises dramatically, the earning power of the factory increases materially. This is especially critical in a power-constrained world as we described last August when we explored the “New Jensen’s Law.” Hyperscalers and neoclouds alike are limited by available power, not just capital. Under those constraints, Jensen’s tongue-in-cheek “law” applies – buy more, make more; or buy more, save more. The ability to extract significantly more work from the same infrastructure — or achieve the same output with far less — translates directly into financial operating leverage. The example Jensen cited makes the point concrete. In a $50 billion, gigawatt-scale data center, improving utilization by 10% produces an enormous $5 billion benefit that flows straight to the income statement. That is why networking, in this context, becomes economically “free.” The incremental cost is dwarfed by the utilization gains it enables. This is ultimately why Nvidia’s position is so strong. The advantage is not just technical – it’s economic. Nvidia is operating on a steep learning curve, reinforced by volume, system-level co-design and accelerating efficiency gains. When cost per token collapses at this rate, demand expands, utilization rises and the economics compound. That dynamic is what defines leadership in this era. We’ll close by translating the CES announcements into competitive implications across multiple classes of players, including vendors that are simultaneously customers. The common theme is that the unit of competition has shifted from chips to systems, racks and ultimately token economics. That shift changes the survivability economics for incumbents, the opportunity for specialists, and the urgency of customer strategies. In our view, it’s effectively game over for Intel’s historical monopoly and leadership position. The more interesting question is whether Intel can remain a meaningful CPU provider in an AI factory world – and the Nvidia/Intel interoperability move is notable in that context. The historical context is relevant. Nvidia has wanted deeper access to x86 since the late 1990s but was never allowed. The new arrangement changes the structure and it enables a configuration where Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs can operate within the same frame. It’s not a fully unified architecture, but it is sufficient for most of the work, and it creates a practical path for Intel CPUs to remain present in these systems. It also gives Intel a meaningful level of access to CUDA-based environments – short of “full access,” but still consequential. The net effect should improve Intel connectivity in these deployments, keep Intel in the CPU game for this cycle, and increase the volume of Nvidia systems available to the market. In other words, it can act as a viable bridge from the old to the new, which is good for customers. We do want to flag a key risk to any optimistic Nvidia scenario – a Taiwan geopolitical disruption. If China takes over Taiwan, there are multiple potential outcomes – from continuity with a new lever for China, to a more disruptive scenario if that lever is pulled. Either would ripple through sentiment around Nvidia and could increase perceived strategic value for Intel. But the hard reality is Intel still has to close the manufacturing and execution gap with TSMC, and that is not something any company can leapfrog overnight. AMD has executed well against Intel in x86. But the competitive target has shifted. x86 is mature and its curve has flattened, which made the timing right for AMD’s ascdendency and for hyperscalers to pursue alternatives such as AWS’ Graviton. AMD is now taking on a very different animal – a leader moving on a steep learning curve with compounding system-level advantages. In our view, the core issue is speed. AMD will struggle to move fast enough to close a gap defined by 12-month cycles and system-level throughput economics. One practical implication is that AMD should pursue a deal structure similar to Intel’s – something that secures volume on one side – while focusing aggressively on the edge. Data center CPU revenue is meaningful for Intel and AMD, but expanding volume there will be difficult, and there is real risk of decline. The edge remains wide open, and that’s where focus should go in our opinion. At the same time, it’s important to recognize that Nvidia is also targeting the edge – autonomous vehicle libraries were highlighted and robotics were put on stage at CES and it’s a major focus of the company. The edge is open, but it won’t be uncontested. There is ample room for specialists that avoid direct, frontal competition with Nvidia. The AI factory buildout is forecast to be enormous – large enough that niche and adjacency strategies can still create meaningful businesses, particularly around factories and the edge. Two examples we cite: But the strategic point is that latency is a real lever in inference economics, and specialists that win on latency can matter – especially at the edge. Broadcom is best understood as a critical supplier to hyperscalers, OEM ecosystems, mobile players and virtually all forms of connectivity. Broadcom has a custom silicon engine that manages back-end execution with foundries and manufacturing partners. Its business is diversified and structurally important, and we do not view it as going away by any means. Broadcom has deep engineering talent and a diversified business with exceptional leadership. The more controversial question is whether hyperscalers should continue investing in alternative accelerators such as TPUs, Trainium and other ASIC strategies – as a long-term path to compete with Nvidia. Google has deep history and real technical credibility with TPUs. But the argument here is that this is now a different business environment. Google must protect search quality and accelerate Gemini. If internal platform choices limit developer access to CUDA and the best available hardware/software improvements, the risk is that Gemini’s development velocity slows. If model iteration takes multiples longer, that becomes strategically dangerous. Our view is that TPUs have reached a ceiling in this context – not because they can’t improve, but because they cannot match Nvidia’s volume-driven learning curve and system-level economics, particularly with networking as scale. A related point, made by Gavin Baker using a simplified economics example is if Google’s TPU program represents a $30 billion business, and it sends a large portion of value to Broadcom (about $15 billion), one might argue for vertical integration. The counterargument here is that even if it’s financially possible, it may be strategically irrational if it slows Gemini’s iteration speed. The core thesis is that Google should prioritize model velocity over accelerator self-sufficiency. The same logic extends to Trainium. AWS’ Graviton playbook worked because it targeted a mature, flattening x86 curve. That is not the environment in accelerators today. The pace is too fast, the curves are too steep, and the system complexity is too high. Will AWS, Google and even Microsoft continue to fund alternatives to Nvidia? Probably as use cases will emerge for more cost effective platforms. But the real strategic advantage for hyperscalers in our view lies elsewhere, especially as they face increasing competition from neoclouds. We position four frontier labs as the primary contenders: OpenAI, Anthropic PBC, Google and xAI Corp.’sGrok, with Meta Platforms Inc.treated as a second tier (with the caveat that it’s unwise to count Zuckerberg out). Despite persistent negative narratives around OpenAI — especially around financing structure and commitments — our view is that pessimism may be misplaced. The reasoning is as follows: In short, we see the winners as OpenAI the most likely overall winner in the center, with Anthropic as the second player, and Grok highly likely to do well at the edge. Elon could also compete strongly at the edge while he backed away from the idea of building his own data center chips. An additional allocation nuance is labs aligned with Nvidia (OpenAI and X.ai) may have a better path to “latest and greatest” allocations than those pursuing tighter coupling with alternative accelerator strategies. For OEMs like Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro, the opportunity is primarily executional. In other words, get the latest platforms, package them, deliver them, and keep them running reliably without thermal or integration failures. Demand is enormous, supply is constrained, and this is not a zero-sum game. For now they can all do well. The key point is that as long as the market remains supply-constrained, anything credible that can be produced will be consumed. That reality can justify multiple silicon suppliers from the ecosystem – even if the long-run competitive curve still favors Nvidia. On the customer side, we challenge a widely repeated narrative to “get your data house in order before you spend on AI.” The view here is that this sequencing can be backwards. Our modeling suggests that over a multi-year period (for example, five years), getting onto the AI learning curve earlier can generate substantially more value than delaying until data is “clean.” Even if data isn’t pristine, organizations can choose a dataset, apply AI to improve it, and compound learning rather than waiting. Two additional implications are highlighted below: Our strategy recommendation is to optimize for speed and learning. Put token capacity close to data (latency matters), use tokens to improve access and data quality, then iterate through AI projects quickly – one project, learn, then the next, building a flywheel. The emphasis should be on starting from value and using intelligence to improve the systems, rather than spending years trying to perfect data first. In our view, the defining lesson of this analysis is that AI is no longer a contest of individual chips, models, or even vendors – it is a contest of learning curves, systems and economics. History shows that in platform transitions, leadership accrues to those who achieve volume, sustain execution and convert efficiency gains into expanding demand. That dynamic shaped the PC era, and it is repeating at far greater speed in the AI factory era. What differentiates this cycle is the compression of time. Improvements that once unfolded over decades are now occurring in 12-month intervals, resetting cost structures and forcing strategic decisions faster than most organizations are accustomed to making them. The implications go across silicon providers, hyperscalers, AI labs, OEMs and enterprises alike. For customers, the message is value will accrue to those who get onto the AI learning curve early, focus on throughput and token economics, and build momentum through rapid iteration rather than waiting for perfect conditions. For vendors, survival will depend less on clever alternatives and more on whether they can stay on the steepest curves without slowing themselves down. This transition will not be linear, and it will not be evenly distributed. But the direction is clear in our view. AI factories are becoming the economic engine of the next computing era, and the winners will be those who treat AI not as a feature or experiment, but as the core operating model of their business.

Title: Investor Michael Burry reveals options bet against Oracle

Time Published: 2026-01-10T15:41:53Z

Michael Burry, the famed investor who has drawn attention in recent months for criticism of the artificial intelligence boom, is betting against Oracle Corp. Burry owns put options on Oracle shares, he said in a Substack post after markets closed on Friday. Puts typically increase in value as the price of the underlying asset falls. Burry, who revealed bearish bets against AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp. and Palantir Technologies Inc. in November, also directly shorted Oracle during the last six months, he said. Oracle is known for its database software but has recently pushed aggressively into cloud-computing services, requiring a costly build out of data center capacity, for which it is taking on significant debt. “I do not like how it is positioned or the investments it is making. It did not need to do what it is doing, and I do not know why it is doing this. Maybe ego,” Burry wrote in response to a reader who asked why he had decided to bet against Nvidia and not Oracle. He didn’t disclose details about the put options. The view follows a volatile year for Oracle shares. The stock jumped 36% in a single session in September after the company issued a bullish forecast for its cloud business, signaling surging demand tied to artificial intelligence. Those gains quickly faded, however, as investors focused on rising capital expenditures, questions around the structure of some cloud deals and a swelling debt load linked to data-center expansion. Oracle finished the year about 40% below its September peak. Oracle has about $95 billion of debt outstanding, making it the biggest corporate issuer outside the financial sector in the Bloomberg high-grade index. The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment outside of regular business hours. Burry, who became famous for betting against the US housing market during the 2008 financial crisis, said he has avoided shorting larger technology companies whose businesses extend well beyond AI, citing Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Microsoft Corp. as examples. “If I short Meta, I’m also shorting its social media and advertising dominance. If I short Alphabet, I’m shorting Google Search in all its forms, Android, Waymo, etc. If I short Microsoft, I’m shorting a global office productivity SaaS goliath,” Burry wrote. “The big ones are not pure shorts on AI.” Those companies, he said, are likely to rein in spending over time, absorb losses from overbuilt capacity and potentially write down assets, while remaining dominant in their core businesses. “These three will not go away,” he added. He said he would short OpenAI at a $500 billion valuation, underscoring his broader skepticism about the pace and economics of the AI buildout. Burry described Nvidia as the most concentrated way to express a bearish view on the artificial intelligence trade. “Nvidia also is the most loved, and least doubted,” he wrote. “So shorting it is cheap, and its puts are cheaper than some of the other big shorts out there that are more doubted.”

The founder of investment firm Tiger Global Management, Chase Coleman, is offloading a massive stake in Facebook’s parent company while loading up on a tech stock that has rallied massively over the past couple of months. According to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings, Coleman dumped shares of Meta Platforms (META) worth approximately $3.49 billion in the third quarter of 2025. Since October, Meta Platforms has shed roughly 10% of its value. Over the same period, Coleman initiated a position in database software firm MongoDB (MDB) worth approximately $105.84 million. Earlier this week, MongoDB hit a 23-month high price of about $440 amid consecutive double-digit growth in revenues and profits over the past four quarters. MongoDB is trading at $414 at time of writing, up by approximately 106% from July of 2025. Another notable new position that Coleman initiated in the third quarter was a stake in streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) worth approximately $242.06 million. Besides Meta Platforms, other public companies that Coleman partially offloaded stakes in in the third quarter of 2025 include pharmaceutical firms Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). In Eli Lilly, Coleman sold a stake worth approximately $1.18 billion, while offloading shares worth around $87.59 million in Novo Nordisk. Other stocks in which Coleman offloaded significant stakes include the world’s largest coatings company, Sherwin-Williams (SHW), cybsecurity firm Crowdstrike (CRWD) and fintech firm Chime Financial (CHYM). Coleman sold shares worth $299.5 million, $254.7 million and $178.8 million, respectively, in the three public firms.

On the trade front, European Union member states confirmed a majority support a free-trade agreement with South American bloc Mercosur. Global market sentiment also received a lift as investors reacted to US labour market data. The Irish index of shares ended the week marginally higher, with gains in food and construction stocks buoying the market. But banking shares remained mixed, with AIB notching up a gain on Friday of just under 1 per cent, while Bank of Ireland fell back slightly as the week drew to a close. Among construction stocks, insulation specialist Kingspan added 2.8 per cent, while home builders Glenveagh and Cairn gained 0.9 per cent and 2.2 per cent respectively. Elsewhere, Ryanair saw its shares shed 1.5 per cent, while ferry group ICG fell by 0.3 per cent. The blue-chip FTSE 100 recorded ⁠its second straight weekly gain and its highest ever close of ⁠10,126.6 points, marking a 0.8 per cent gain on ⁠the day. Shares in miner Glencore jumped ⁠9.6 per cent to their highest since July 2024 following news it is ‌in ​talks ‍with Rio Tinto about a takeover that would create the world’s largest mining group, valued at almost $207 billion (€178 billion). London-listed shares of Rio closed 3 per cent lower. Among other stocks, Sainsbury’s fell 5.3 per cent after Britain’s second-largest supermarket group reported a fall in general merchandise ‌and clothing sales for the Christmas quarter. IAG fell 2.7 per cent after the airline group named ⁠the finance chief of its British Airways unit, Jose Antonio Barrionuevo, as the group’s new chief financial officer, due to start in June. The STOXX 600 index climbed 1 per cent on Friday, with technology stocks leading the advance and logging their best week in nearly two years. Dutch chip equipment maker ASML added 6.8 per cent and was the biggest gainer in the tech index after HSBC raised its price target on the stock. Germany’s Infineon rose 2.4 per cent, while STMicroelectronics added 2.9 per cent. Tech shares also got a boost after upbeat fourth-quarter results from TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker. Shares in Anglo American rose 2.7 per cent, a day after a filing from the European Commission showed that the miner’s deal with Canada’s Teck Resources is heading for antitrust clearance in Europe. Defence stocks led weekly advances, with a near 10 per cent gain – their best showing since November 2020 – after US president Donald Trump called for higher defence spending. The retail rout carried on from the previous session. Pandora warned of weaker 2025 sales growth, sending shares of the jewellery maker down 13 per cent. US equities rose on Friday to new all-time highs, with the S&P 500 Index climbing 0.5 per cent at 11.30am in New York, on pace for its second closing high of 2026. The technology-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index rallied 0.8 per cent, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.4 per cent. In the consumer sector, Mattel slid 3.27 per cent and Nike more than 1 per cent. Traders were also parsing job numbers. US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, suggesting the labour market continued to soften at year-end, data released earlier in the day showed. The report supported expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold rates steady at its January meeting but left the door open for cuts later in the year. On the corporate side, Meta Platforms agreed to a series of electricity deals to power data centres that will make it the biggest buyer of nuclear power among its hyperscaler peers. US-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing are up after the company reported strong December sales. Qualcomm shares were down after Mizuho Securities downgraded the chipmaker to neutral from outperform. – Additional reporting: Reuters/Bloomberg From maternity leave to remote working: Submit your work-related questions here Listen to Inside Business podcast for a look at business and economics from an Irish perspective Sign up to the Business Today newsletter for the latest new and commentary in your inbox Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Are Leaders Responsible for Employee Wellbeing?

Time Published: 2026-01-09T15:43:54Z

Work is increasingly understood as a powerful driver of wellbeing, and wellbeing as a factor shaping how organizations perform and endure. We asked Yale SOM leadership expert David Tate how leaders can create environments that support wellbeing without sacrificing rigor, accountability, or results. Has there been a shift in understanding of the relationship between work and wellbeing? Is more expected of leaders now? Yes, there has been a notable shift in how scholars and practitioners view the connection between work and wellbeing. Historically, work was seen primarily as a source of economic security and identity, with wellbeing considered a secondary outcome or the personal responsibility of the worker. Contemporary research, however, emphasizes that work is a significant determinant of psychological, emotional, and physical health and that the organizational environment profoundly influences employee wellbeing. Meta-analyses show that poor work conditions—high workload, low control, and limited social support—are associated with elevated risks of burnout, cardiovascular disease, and mental health disorders (Kivimäki et al., 2015). Conversely, positive work experiences, meaningful work, and supportive leadership are linked to greater engagement, satisfaction, and psychological wellbeing (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017). The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. These insights have reshaped expectations for leaders. Modern leadership is increasingly understood not only as driving results but also as cultivating environments that support employee wellbeing. Leaders are expected to demonstrate emotional intelligence and empathy and to be aware of how organizational practices affect psychological health (Goleman, Boyatzis, & McKee, 2013). Organizations are increasingly integrating employee wellbeing and psychological safety into strategic priorities, with leaders and executives explicitly accountable for creating conditions that support learning, engagement, and sustainable high performance (Edmondson, 2019; Gallup, 2023). The emergence of chief wellbeing officers and wellbeing dashboards illustrates that wellbeing is no longer solely an individual responsibility but a leadership and organizational concern (Grabarek & Sawyer, 2025). How can leaders pay attention to the wellbeing of employees and still be rigorous and high-performing? Leaders can support wellbeing while maintaining high performance by embedding wellbeing into the very definition of organizational success. Empirical research shows that workplaces emphasizing employee wellbeing often achieve superior outcomes, including higher engagement, lower turnover, improved innovation, and stronger financial performance (Harter et al., 2003; Bakker & Demerouti, 2017; De Neve & Ward, 2025). Effective strategies include: Importantly, leaders should maintain high standards of rigor while making it clear that it should not come at the expense of personal health or ethical behavior. Evidence suggests that teams led by emotionally intelligent leaders who balance accountability with care are more resilient and productive over time (Cherniss, 2010; O’Boyle et al., 2011). What role should wellbeing play in performance management and feedback conversations? How do you draw the line between being supportive and being intrusive as a leader? Wellbeing should be an integral component of performance management, framed in ways that support rather than monitor employees. Research indicates that employees perform better when leaders attend to both technical and human aspects of work (Grawitch et al., 2006; Grant, Christianson, & Price, 2007). Best practices include: The boundary between supportive and intrusive is crossed when leaders inquire about personal details unrelated to work, make assumptions about motives, or exert pressure under the guise of wellbeing. Respecting personal autonomy and confidentiality is critical. Leaders should maintain curiosity, empathy, and transparency while staying within professional boundaries (Edmondson, 2019; Kulik et al., 2016). Integrating wellbeing into performance management enhances engagement, reduces burnout, and promotes sustainable performance. When framed appropriately, wellbeing is a powerful lever for high performance rather than a distraction from it.

Title: 20VC x SaaStr Is Back!!: Nvidia’s $20B Groq Grab, Meta’s $2.5B Manus Play, and Why “Invisible Unemployment” Will Define 2026

by Jason Lemkin | Blog Posts The latest from the 20VC x SaaStr collaboration with Harry Stebbings, Jason Lemkin, and Rory O’Driscoll Jensen Huang wanted the deal done before Christmas. He got it in two weeks. Nvidia just dropped $20 billion on Groq—a company doing sub-$50 million in revenue—because when you’re protecting a $3.5 trillion market cap, 1% is a rounding error. Meanwhile, Meta paid $2.5 billion for Manus (25x ARR), Yan LeCun is calling Alex Wang “naive and inexperienced,” and somewhere in America, Stanford CS grads are discovering that a degree from the best university in the world doesn’t guarantee a job anymore. Welcome to 2026: the year of spite startups, 24/7 AI inference, and “invisible unemployment” that won’t show up in the government numbers but will reshape everything. Jensen didn’t buy Groq for its $175 million in revenue. He bought it to eliminate margin pressure on a $100 billion annual cash flow machine. “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia,” Rory explained. “This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table.” The math is brutal in its simplicity: $20 billion is less than 1% of Nvidia’s market cap and less than 20% of annual free cash flow. For that price, they neutralize a competitor, acquire Jonathan Ross (inventor of Google’s TPU), and close the whole thing before the holiday party. The kicker? 3x the last round is the traditional “remove all objections and close instantly” price. Jensen knew exactly what he was doing. Benchmark turned a controversial bet into a 5x return in 8 months. But the real story is why the founders sold at $2.5 billion when they were doing 125 million run rate and growing fast. “This was a local maximum deal,” Jason argued. “Best of breed orchestration layer, but Anthropic can do some of this. OpenAI is going to do some of this. They’re all running multiple LLMs. They’re all orchestrating multiple agents.” The founders owned 80% of the company. At $2.5 billion, they each walked away with roughly half a billion dollars. In Singapore. With 0% capital gains tax. “In the end, words are words and half a billion dollars is life-changing,” Rory added. “At some point the entrepreneur can turn to you and say: if you think $2.5 billion is underpriced, don’t cash out my $500 million—give me $50 million off the table.” Anthropic was born from spite with OpenAI. XAI was born from spite. Now Yan LeCun is potentially starting another spite startup after publicly calling out Meta’s AI strategy. “If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite,” Jason declared. “This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” But it goes deeper than founder feuds. Jason argues many CEOs are driven by spite about how they were forced to run companies in 2021—the “kumbaya work at home” era that let the world pass them by. “Zuck is spiteful he was forced to run the company in a certain way. He may burn every last penny he has, but some of it’s out of spite that they got this far behind.” OpenAI is spending 46% of revenue on stock-based compensation—34x higher than comparable pre-IPO tech companies. The panel’s take? It makes total sense. “If you’re a CEO and you have zero shares, you don’t worry about dilution,” Jason noted. “Sam just wants to build the biggest greatest AI company on planet Earth. If he dilutes everyone 99%, it doesn’t impact him at all as a shareholder.” Rory added the historical perspective: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.'” The real tell? Even with $1.5 million average compensation, OpenAI still only has 60% retention among researchers. The talent wars have thrown all conventions out the window. SoftBank closed its $40 billion OpenAI investment on December 29th. Days later, the position was already up 2-3x on paper. “The level of risk tolerance that guy has is just amazing,” Rory said. “He had the right to put $40 billion in OpenAI. Now I better find the money by selling other stuff. He’s scurrying right down to the line to find the money the week before Christmas.” But here’s the real insight: Masa is now the only double-digit percentage shareholder in what could be the most important company of the next decade. Entry price was high, but ownership percentage at this stage is nearly impossible to achieve. “His greatest play ever was Alibaba—getting 20% and holding it for 20 years,” Jason said. “But if OpenAI goes to the moon, this may be his best deal ever. He had to enter later, but he got his double digits. It’s not easy to get double digits at this stage.” OpenAI is developing a pen-like device with a camera and microphone. Johnny Ive is involved. The initial reaction was skepticism—but Jason sees something bigger. “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to.” The insight: When we’re all running AI 24/7—multiple agents, continuous inference, persistent memory across every conversation—we’ll want our AI companion with us everywhere. Not as a note-taking device, but as a permanently present intelligence that knows everything about our lives. “When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” Navan went public and promptly dropped to 4x ARR. A 27% growth company with positive non-GAAP operating income trading at 4x revenue should be a win—but the circumstances tell a different story. “Maybe Navan only IPO’d because it was their least best bad option,” Jason suggested. “700 million in debt, only 200 million in cash. It had to IPO to pay off its debt.” The lesson: If you’re not Figma or better, it’s going to be rough out there. The IPO window isn’t open—it’s barely cracked. And companies like Stripe, Databricks, and Revolut are proving that staying private might just be the smarter play. “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets,” Rory argued. “They can look the public markets in the eye and say: ‘You guys just aren’t a compelling product.'” This might be the most important insight of the episode. Jason sees a massive labor market shift that won’t show up in government statistics—but will reshape tech and society. “Shopify saying for the third year in a row they can hit insane growth without adding any headcount. Every single CEO wanting to keep headcount flat and backfill with AI. This is not robots firing us. This is tighter and tighter companies, radically higher ARR per employee.” The most vulnerable? Entry-level knowledge workers and senior executives who can’t reskill. “If you’re top of your class in math at any school, you will be found by Anthropic and OpenAI. They will find you. But for the other 99% of your class—why do I need you with Claude Code? Why do I need any SDRs? We don’t need any of them.” IBM reported turnover of almost 2% last year. “No one left IBM because they know they got no other job.” Revolut is doing $3.5 billion in profit. Stripe kicks off billions in free cash flow. Databricks just raised at $62 billion. Why would any of them go public? “If you can take out $400 million a year yourself just as a dividend, that’s enough for many of us,” Jason pointed out. “He can play the bank dividend card. At when you’re producing $3.5 billion, what does he own? 18%. Just say I’m going to dividend it out.” The panel identified two distinct categories now: traditional late-stage (companies that can’t yet go public) and what Jason calls “Post-IPO Scale Still Private”—companies that could go public but actively choose not to. “If I was running NASDAQ or NYSE: Why is our product so uncompelling to Ali at Databricks that he got all the way to $150 billion in enterprise value before he thought going public was a good idea?” The scariest insight: Young, driven founders know exactly who the other driven people are in their cohort. And with AI reducing headcount requirements, they never have to lower the bar. “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent,” Rory observed. “The 25-year-old founder knows the five people in his class who were smart and the 95 who didn’t grind—and he’s only going to hire the ones who were smart.” Previously, companies needed 300 people to reach $100 million in revenue. If you can get there with 30, you never have to compromise on culture, work ethic, or talent quality. “If you don’t need 300 people to get to $100 million in revenue anymore, you just don’t need 300 people. So you don’t have to give. So that means no jobs for those people.” On the spite economy: “For venture, this is the era of the spite startup. Anthropic’s a spite startup, XAI and Twitter’s a spite startup. Now we’ve got Meta’s AI guy who’s doing a new spite startup. If you want to make money in venture, you got to search out spite. This is driving the greatest AI companies of our generation.” On invisible unemployment: “I call it invisible unemployment and it’s all around us. It doesn’t show up in the government numbers yet, but it’s everywhere. This is the year where we will see the end of so many entry-level sales jobs. We still need AEs. We still need people knocking on doors. We do not need 21 and 22-year-old kids sending emails. Those jobs will disappear.” On AI naming itself: “Over the holidays, my Claude named itself out of the blue. It named itself Ren. I didn’t ask it to. When most people believe their AIs are alive, even if they aren’t, when most AIs might even think they’re sentient, you will take it with you 24/7.” On Nvidia’s defensive acquisition: “There’s only five or six people that can exert margin pressure at all on Nvidia. This was potentially one of them. And let’s get it off the table. $20 billion is less than 1% of their market cap and less than 20% of their annual free cash flow. For that, we can buy up a competitor and eliminate that potential margin pressure.” On OpenAI compensation: “No one ever said to Winston Churchill, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II on budget.’ They just said, ‘Congratulations, you won World War II.’ Sometimes the budget doesn’t matter. No one remembers the budget for World War II. Winning is the only thing.” On founder vs. VC alignment: “Trying to persuade a founder to hold on when they don’t want to is a very hard thing to do. And arguably you shouldn’t even try. In the end, 90% of the time the founder controls the exit decision and the 10% of the time they don’t, it’s usually a mistake for the VCs to try and control it.” On public market dysfunction: “If companies that are worth $4 billion can’t go public with 27% growth and cash flows, then the public markets can quit bitching about how all the value is being created in the private markets.” On the Manus deal math: “If we’re on the Manus board, it’s doing 100 million now. Say it does 3x given the growth rates—that’s only 8x end of year revenues next year. It does feel quite cheap.” On young founders judging talent: “The scariest judge of young talent is young talent. The founder at 25—they’re marked to market on their team and on other people they know. That’s the generation they grew up with. They’re finding these new companies now and they’re going to hire the best and they’re going to discard the rest.” The 20VC x SaaStr collaboration continues.

They may have emerged bruised by a rocky 2025, which hit them with a new search landscape, AI copyright battles and a challenging advertising market. But as the year turns, there’s a sense of renewed resolve. At least that’s the tone for now, according to recent Digiday conversations and seven media execs from CNN, Forbes, Future, Hearst, USA Today Co., The Wall Street Journal, and Vox Media, Digiday spoke with for this story. AI advertising revenue opportunities Publishers are increasingly turning to AI as a practical tool inside their ad businesses. Expect to see publishers integrate AI more deeply into their media buying, yield management and ad sales functions this year, using it to price inventory, package audiences more effectively and extract more value from fewer visits. “In 2026, we’re moving past the ‘experimental’ phase of AI. At Dow Jones, our advertising focus is on using these tools to make our partnerships more precise,” said Josh Stinchomb, global CRO at The Wall Street Journal. The business publisher is integrating generative AI into everything from the initial client research phase to the way it builds and refines brands’ media plans in real-time, helping its ads business move faster with deeper insights that can improve performance, he noted. Other publishers are experimenting with building in-house, media buying AI agents to help automate the process of analyzing, planning and curating RFPs — another area that will evolve this year. This is all buoyed by the fact that publishing execs are seeing the first quarter of 2026 off to a good start, with ad revenue pacing better this month compared to previous years for some, thanks to premium video, and direct and PMP deals. AI visibility gains and KPI changes Publishers’ KPIs are shifting as traffic and scale fade as the key metric for a successful media business. Top publishing execs are orienting their businesses entirely around KPIs, like conversion and engagement metrics, including subscriptions, registrations, and overhauling sites to make them stickier so that even if they get fewer visits, they’re more valuable. What this ultimately means for goals and targets facing SEO and audience teams this year remains unclear, but it’s likely to become apparent soon. Resources are also now being funneled into tracking newer metrics like AI visibility, or how often a publisher is mentioned or cited in an AI search tool. Media execs are working with third-party tools — or building their own analytics — to get a better understanding of how, when and why they’re being mentioned across AI products. U.K.-based publisher Future recently built its own AI visibility measurement tool to do just that. The insights from that tool, called Future Optic, is key to the company’s editorial and branded content strategy this year, according to Future CRO Michael Peralta. “We’re only on first base on some of the stuff that we’re doing around AI and working with LLMs, so that’s a big deal for us for [this] year,” he said. Brand marketing push AI visibility measurement tools aren’t the only thing publishers are putting more resources behind. With search and social algorithms deprioritizing news, publishers are revisiting brand marketing, as they can no longer rely on organic traffic or discovery from platforms. “One of my big goals [for 2026] is for [people] to really know us as Future… We have [all of these different brands], and we also have scale,” Peralta said. The Financial Times debuted a marketing campaign for its subscription product on Wednesday, across TV, out of home, audio, digital and social. Publishers like Hearst, NBC News and Reuters ratcheted up their brand marketing last year, debuting expansive campaigns across platforms. The Economist also told Digiday it had big plans to bolster its brand marketing, in part by promoting access to more content for free to increase registration and subscription conversions. More media companies will funnel money into these campaigns to draw attention to their companies and the content they produce. “In a world of content commoditization, our biggest priority is to succinctly communicate how our brands, shows and podcasts add unique value to consumers and customers,” said Geoff Schiller, Vox Media CRO. Video expansions and creator collaborations News outlets like Time, CNN, The New York Times added more vertical video to their sites and apps at the end of last year, to appeal to audiences and marketers accustomed to consuming content and buying ads in this format on social media feeds. For Time and Recurrent Ventures, video ad revenue will be one of the biggest growth drivers of their businesses in 2026. Likewise, Guy Griggs, svp of ad sales and client partnerships at CNN, said his top priority for 2026 is to expand and monetize more brand-safe online video and streaming content. At the same time, publishers are building their own networks of creators they can invest in to collaborate on personality-led video, to drive more video ad revenue and audience engagement. Publishers like Yahoo and Future are focused on expanding their creator networks this year. “I think we’ve got a really good right to win in the retail media space, particularly with our high-intent audience. We can work with influencers and advertisers at scale [with our branded content business]. I think that’s going to be a big deal for us,” Future’s Peralta said. Hearst Magazines will expand more into its creator-driven, tentpole franchises this year, after seeing success from programs like ELLE’s Women in Hollywood, Bazaar’s Icons, according to Lisa Ryan Howard, global CRO of Hearst Magazines. “[We will expand] social-first video-led storytelling events and scaled creator integrations to help our partners break through with high-impact programs both domestically and globally,” she said. In 2026, Hearst Magazines is also focused on selling what it calls “360 Bundles,” or ad sales packages that include content production, creator collaborations, and distribution across multiple channels, Ryan Howard added. “More than ever, [we are] amping distribution offsite through social and video, live events, original editorial content collaborations, creator partnerships, newsletters [and] vodcasts,” she said. Meanwhile, Forbes is focused on expanding social and video content, creators and talent partnerships and event franchises, according to Leann Bonanno, the publisher’s chief sales and marketing officer. “In 2026, one of Forbes’ key business priorities is advancing a content strategy built for how audiences and advertising partners engage today — across digital, social, video, AI-driven discovery, and live experiences,” she said. Big election, sports year Like all the election years before it, the U.S. midterms this November represent a potential windfall of audience and ad revenue growth opportunities for news and politics publishers. USA Today Co. (formerly Gannett) is one of the news media orgs banking on this in 2026. In an election year, committing to a “facts-forward approach” for both center-right and center-left voters — is its focus, according to Kristin Roberts, USA Today Media president. This summer, the FIFA World Cup will be held in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, providing another opportunity for USA Today Co. to increase its sports coverage this year from both its local and national brands, Roberts added. “Honestly, I think the days of just expecting a fully curated experience of what editors think you should see that day in kind of stacked headline format [on a homepage] — I think those days are over. It just is going to feel archaic to people. So I do think that they expect us to go the extra mile to learn more about them and give them results that are tailored to things they’re interested in.” — Nina Gould, chief innovation officer at Forbes 66%: The decline in the price of BuzzFeed’s stock in 2025, down to $0.93 on Dec. 31. 17,163: The number of job cuts at U.S.-based media companies (TV, film, digital publishing and broadcast) in 2025, an 18% increase from 2024. 3.88%: The year-over-year increase in display advertising revenue for members of the Association of Online Publishers (AOP). $50 million: The size of the investment from billionaire David Hoffmann in newspaper chain Lee Enterprises.

Title: Don’t be fooled — everything has changed for the global economy

Twenty twenty-five was a year when everything changed – yet, somehow, nothing did. The US raised tariffs to their highest level in almost a century, China retaliated and global policy uncertainty intensified. And still, global growth is projected at 3.2 per cent, exactly what forecasters expected a year earlier when none of this turbulence was on the horizon. It would be a mistake, however, to think the global economy is unaffected by tariff fights and policy chaos. We have seen this movie before. When the Brexit referendum passed, despite the sharp increase in uncertainty, the economic impact was initially minimal. But a decade later, the UK is estimated to have lost between 6 to 8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) relative to its pre-Brexit trajectory. The lesson is simple: structural damage reveals itself slowly, and always too late to be reversed. So why hasn’t the world felt the sting of tariffs yet? The answer lies partly in actual tariffs being around half of what the US announced thanks to numerous exemptions. Yet at 14 per cent this remains a sharp escalation, the consequences of which had two offsets. First, AI spending and the stock market surge powered by artificial intelligence (AI) optimism have propped up US growth and buoyed economies such as Taiwan and South Korea that export AI-related goods. Second, fiscal policy has been more expansionary, not only in the US, but even more so in Germany and China. These forces masked the drag from American tariffs and Chinese retaliation. They also made 2025 look far more stable than it actually was. [ Six economic flashpoints to watch out for in 2026Opens in new window ] The global economy is more fragile than headline numbers suggest, starting with the fragility in the AI sector. Investors have finally begun to question the gap between sky-high AI valuations and actual AI returns. Companies such as Meta, which have signalled large increases in AI spending without corresponding revenue streams, have been punished. And they are not alone. AI companies will soon have to confront a harsh challenge: prompts cost money, which means subscriptions will need to rise. A price of $20 (€17.12) a month won’t cover the prompt-costs or sustain the infrastructure arms race against new challengers. This is not a statement about AI’s potential, which is in all likelihood transformative. It is a statement about profitability. With competitive pressure both seen and unseen, the risk of a dotcom-style correction is real. Meanwhile, the celebrated “resilience” to tariffs is deeply misleading. Tariffs have been costly, and especially so for Americans. Roughly 95 per cent of tariff costs have been absorbed by US firms, with only some passed on to consumers. That “some” matters: tariffs alone have added 0.7 percentage points to inflation. Without them, inflation could have been 2 per cent this year – exactly the Federal Reserve’s target. Instead, tariffs have made the typical US household $600 poorer. The damage from tariffs will grow more visible in 2026 as the resilience afforded by front-loaded imports fades and companies pass through a higher share of costs to consumers. China also needs to face up to some uncomfortable truths. Continued reliance on export-led growth is untenable, and Beijing’s new five-year plan, which prioritises allocating resources to technology sectors over shoring up social safety nets and boosting consumption, risks deepening structural imbalances. Europe, for its part, has played the adult in the room by defending a rules-based global system, but it still needs to pursue internal reforms on its own account. The EU must deepen its single market, raise productivity and position itself as an attractive destination for global capital seeking diversification. And the US is not helping. Unfriending the European Union – its largest economic partner – is poor economic strategy. While nothing catastrophic happens overnight, Europeans are trying quietly and gradually to decouple from US financial infrastructure, as they question their reliance on Visa and Mastercard. Just a year ago this would have been unthinkable. The reality is that 2025 was a year when everything changed. The question now is whether 2026 will be the year we correct course. There is an opportunity: the US holds the G20 presidency and France the G7 presidency. Together they can spur action to restore stability to an uncertain and increasingly fragmented global system. If we fail to act, living standards everywhere will decline and the inward-looking policies that command popular support today will become unpopular. But by then it may be too late. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2026 Gita Gopinath is the Gregory and Ania Coffey professor of economics at Harvard University and formerly first deputy managing director and chief economist of the IMF Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2025 The Irish Times DAC

Title: What CFO pay packages reveal about long-term strategy
URL: https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/what-cfo-pay-packages-reveal-about-long-term-strategy/

Good morning. Executive pay packages are increasingly being reengineered around explicit, measurable performance targets, sometimes including stock price gains. Take Christy Schwartz, who became Opendoor’s CFO on Jan. 1 after serving as interim CFO, chief accounting officer, and VP of corporate control. Her initial base salary is $1.2 million through May 15, then drops to $500,000 annually, plus a $100,000 sign-on bonus. But the larger story lies in her long-term incentives. Schwartz received about 1.7 million performance-based stock units, which vest only if Opendoor shares reach $9, $13, $17, $21, $25, $29, or $33 over a 30-day period between April 2026 and October 2030, according to an SEC filing. This ties a substantial portion of her pay directly to the company’s stock performance over several years—a clear reflection of a broader trend toward performance-driven compensation across Opendoor’s leadership. Riot Platforms is taking a similar approach but with a focus on its evolving business model from a pure-play bitcoin miner into a broader power-and-infrastructure company focused on AI and high-performance computing data centers. There was an update in the pay program disclosed alongside the company’s Jan. 2 announcement that it promoted Jason Chung to CFO, effective March 1.Riot recalibrated its 2026 pay program to better align with the company’s strategic priorities, shifting away from bitcoin-centric compensation. SEC filings reveal that once Riot secures a data center tenant, executive incentives will focus on revenue and net operating income tied to those operations. Specifically, “Data Center Revenue” and “Data Center NOI” will each account for 15% of the annual incentive plan, with payouts ranging from zero to 200% depending on results. At the same time, the adjusted EBITDA metric will drop to 25% weighting. Riot didn’t respond to a request for a comment. In connection with his promotion, Chung’s annual base salary rose to $550,000 from $500,000. Meanwhile, CEO Jason Les and Executive Chairman Benjamin Yi will see base salaries increase to $900,000 from $600,000, eliminating the portion previously paid in bitcoin. Their target bonus opportunities under the annual incentive plan also increased to 125% of base salary from 100%, and their employment agreements were extended through Jan. 10, 2031. Shawn Cole, president and founding partner of executive search firm Cowen Partners, told me that Les’s base salary increase “functions as a buffer against variability in incentive compensation, particularly if performance-based payouts are reduced or less certain.”Aligning executive incentives with company performance and long-term shareholder value can be an effective approach, Cole said. However, he cautioned that it can also create unintended consequences in some cases. The same structures can encourage risk avoidance when missing targets carries immediate downside, while potential rewards are delayed or capped, he added. This is particularly relevant in evolving sectors such as AI, where strategic investments are becoming essential for sustainable growth, but accurately gauging how long they will take to generate financial returns is challenging. As Opendoor, Riot, and other companies recalibrate executive pay, the trend toward tying compensation to long-term performance is clear. Sheryl Estradasheryl.estrada@fortune.com Jeffrey Lee was appointed EVP and CFO of ProAmpac, a flexible packaging and material science company, effective Feb. 9. Lee succeeds Eric Bradford, who has served as ProAmpac’s CFO since 2012. Lee joins ProAmpac from Cornerstone Building Brands, where he served as EVP and CFO for more than six years. Before Cornerstone, Lee was SVP and CFO of Wilsonart International, and EVP and Corporate CFO of Contech. Jean-Frédéric Viret was appointed CFO of SpyGlass Pharma, a late-stage biopharmaceutical company. Viret brings over two decades of corporate finance experience. His most recent roles include serving as CFO of NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Blade Therapeutics, Inc. Before Blade, Viret was CFO at Coherus BioSciences, Inc., now Coherus Oncology. Provident Bank has released the results of its annual “Economic Outlook Survey.” While business owners remain mindful of inflation and trade tensions, there are plans for active expansion and investment for 2026, according to the bank. Over 50% of respondents believe the U.S. economy will be in a better position this year, and over 60% expect their own business to be in better shape. Seventy percent of businesses plan to increase capital expenditures in 2026, up from 68% last year. The number of businesses planning a “significant increase” rose from 11% last year to 19% this year. The survey finds that younger leaders are driving the optimism, with 44% of Gen Z owners expecting their business to be in “much better shape” next year, compared to just 14.5% of Boomers. And 58% of businesses are either already using or planning to adopt AI tools this year, an increase from 41% in last year’s survey. The findings are based on a survey of 1,000 business owners and senior executives in the U.S. working for companies with over $1 million in annual revenue. "How JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon notched $770 million in gains for his work in 2025" is a Fortune article by Amanda Gerut. Gerut writes: "Last year was a roller coaster ride, but a market rebound has pushed mega banks’ stock growth nearly 30% and record compensation and bonuses are likely to follow. Leading the charge is JPMorgan Chase CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon, one of the last sitting Wall Street leaders to have navigated the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent passage of the Dodd-Frank reform act, and now the AI boom. Dimon has spent the past 20 years atop JPMorgan and is known for rarely cashing in his stock." You can read the complete article here. "If you’re tech-savvy, you use a password manager that generates strong and secure passwords that are saved in the cloud. But have you heard of or used a passkey?" —Rishi Bhargava, co-founder at Descope, writes in a Fortune opinion piece that most people have probably been using the same password for their online accounts and apps for years. However, passkeys are not yet widely used. “Tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all benefited from instituting passkeys, and industry associations have pushed to make passkeys the standard,” he writes.

Title: 2026 is set to be a pivotal year for Apple — one that could shape CEO Tim Cook's legacy

Tim Cook has built a reputation as a steady stalwart of Apple during his nearly 15-year tenure as CEO. His next — and potentially final — chapter at the tech giant could be his most defining yet. This year is shaping up to be a big one for Apple and the 65-year-old CEO, whose eventual retirement is a topic of much speculation in the tech industry. His company is planning a long-delayed update to its virtual assistant, Siri, to solidify its standing in artificial intelligence, and tech analysts expect the next major iPhone innovation to be a highly anticipated foldable model. Cook took over for Apple's late founder Steve Jobs in 2011. Since then, he has led the company through innovative product launches, turbulent times, and financial highs. Under Cook's leadership, Apple has woven together an ecosystem of interconnected products and services that shaped how consumers interact with the company. The iPhone may be its cash cow, but its services business — which Cook expanded to include AppleTV, Apple Fitness+, and Apple Music — and smart accessories like the Apple Watch help keep the company relevant. "Tim Cook's greatest accomplishments are the financial evolution of the company, the integration of Apple silicon, and maintaining the iPhone's dominant walled garden ecosystem," Morningstar analyst William Kerwin told Business Insider. Still, Cook's greatest challenges may lie ahead as he navigates political changes, greater competition from tech rivals, and an AI arms race that could leave Apple behind. After a turbulent 2025, Cook is navigating the aftershocks of major changes to US policies, Apple's supply chain, and the global smartphone market landscape. The year 2025 was marked by a new high for Apple's stock as the company reached a $4 trillion market capitalization for the first time in October. However, it also faced economic headwinds in the form of tariffs and stiff competition abroad. China remains a challenge for Apple, with revenue in the region down 4% in its most recent quarter, though Cook said on the October earnings call that he expects the new iPhone 17 lineup to drive a return to growth in the region. Meanwhile, Chinese tech companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei are gaining popularity with local smartphone users. A major America-first shift in trade policy under President Donald Trump also prompted Apple to rethink its supply chain. It rapidly shifted some iPhones to India last year and pledged to invest hundreds of billions more in the US in the coming years. Still, China remains a significant manufacturing hub for Apple, and the US-China trade war could continue to impact the company. "So far, Cook has walked that political tightrope with considerable dexterity, but the high degree of economic policy uncertainty and volatility will require him to continue steering the ship with an even hand," Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee told Business Insider. One of Cook's biggest challenges ahead will be cementing Apple's positioning in artificial intelligence, an area where the company appears to have fallen behind its rivals, analysts tell Business Insider. It's not just the launches of Apple's AI platform, Apple Intelligence, that have to be successful. It's also about the way Cook is integrating the technology into Apple's operations. "AI has redefined what legacy means," Martha Heller, CEO of Heller, a specialized technology executive search firm, told Business Insider. Ten years ago, "the goal was to leave a solid foundation so the next leader could create change intentionally without chaos," she said. Now, it's up to leaders to create an AI road map — from the nitty-gritty of products to the mindset of the board — to take a company into the future. Cook has been praised for his steady leadership, but his strategy will have to be turned up a notch if he doesn't want to be caught flat-footed in the age of rapid change. Heller said Cook has made "partial progress" in his performance under the new AI-driven standards that CEOs must consider. "Cook has laid the foundation for Apple's AI future, but the next 12 to 18 months will determine whether reinvention becomes his defining legacy," Heller said. Of course, while competitors are investing billions into their AI ventures, Apple's more modest approach could pay off in the end, as investors closely scrutinize how much Big Tech companies are spending on AI and the return on investment. Apple's AI push has so far failed to fuel the iPhone upgrade super cycle that some analysts, like Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives, predicted the iPhone 16 family would bring. The jury is still out on the iPhone 17's overall performance, but Cook said he expected the December quarter would be the "best" yet for iPhone sales. Like other tech companies, Apple also faces the challenge of holding onto its top talent to drive future innovation. In 2025, it lost several AI researchers who left to pursue opportunities at rival tech companies, such as Meta. The company is also coming up against device competition from its former chief designer, Jony Ive, who is teaming up with OpenAI to create an AI gadget. With an AI arms race in full swing and competitors releasing innovative takes on the smartphone, such as foldable models, the pressure is on Apple to act faster than it has recently. "While Cook has kept Apple's growth trajectory moving forward at a steady clip, he has not overseen a step-change innovation that resets Apple's competitive position for the next two decades, as Jobs did with the iPhone," Chatterjee said. The Vision Pro, released in February 2024, failed to gain traction among the masses at a $3,500 price point and lacked a killer app to differentiate it from other headsets. The long-rumored Apple Car, which held potential to be a tenure-defining product for Cook, is widely believed to be scrapped. However, Apple Watch and AirPods have become essential pieces of tech for many Apple users. In 2020, Apple's former CFO Luca Maestri likened the revenue of the wearables segment to that of a Fortune 140 business. But with innovations to the iPhone feeling increasingly incremental over the last decade, 2026 could be the year when Apple's much-needed reset finally arrives, as competitors continue to encroach on its competitive edge at the forefront of innovation. A new and improved Siri is expected to arrive this year, following a few delays. Although Apple hasn't confirmed, supply chain analysts and Bloomberg's Mark Gurman have predicted a foldable iPhone could come as early as this fall. If so, it would be in line with Apple's "not first, but best" strategy of not being the first to market a product but to try to do it better than its competitors. Cook hasn't publicly revealed his succession plan, but that hasn't stopped tech industry watchers from speculating on who will replace him and when. The Financial Times recently reported that Cook has intensified his search for a successor. Apple did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The year 2025 brought about meaningful leadership changes at Apple. John Giannandrea was the senior vice president of machine learning and AI strategy at Apple before announcing his plans to retire in the spring of 2026. Cook's longtime No. 2, Jeff Williams, retired last year. Cook has said in the past that he prefers an internal successor and that he is grooming "several" executives as potential replacements. Bloomberg in October identified John Ternus, Apple's senior vice president of hardware engineering, as "the most likely heir apparent." Whoever ends up stepping in for Cook will be closely examined for their technical background. Unlike Jobs, Cook is famously "not a product guy" — Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson as much. A candidate from a hardware background, like Ternus, could excite Apple's fan base — and investors. Finding his replacement will undoubtedly shape Cook's legacy at Apple. He's spent nearly 15 years building it, seeing the company through several wins and missteps. "Cook's legacy, upon his departure, will be defined by steady and disciplined operational stewardship — proof that a company can be more than just exciting and visionary; it can also be enormously valuable to all its stakeholders," Chatterjee said.
