More Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 1 this year, which means it is today. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales are live across the biggest retailers. However, the day is almost over, and deals are already disappearing. If you've got your eye on something, now is the time to shop. Almost all major retailers offer tons of deals and discounts for Cyber Monday. Think of companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as more specialized retailers such as B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can also run out of stock, so there are pros and cons to shopping in‑store and online. Cyber Monday sales are running right now, but they won't linger much longer. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and although that's now behind us, plenty of fresh discounts have been rolling in for Cyber Monday. But as the day starts winding down, so will the sales. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We’ve rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll highlight the best deals we find throughout the event. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive -- the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Google is winning the AI race – isn’t it? Recent headlines – “Why Google is winning the AI race”, “5 reasons Google has never looked stronger”, “Google is suddenly beating its magnificent seven peers in the AI race” – suggest as much. So does the share price of Google parent Alphabet: the stock is now up some 70 per cent this year, more than twice as big as Nvidia’s gains. Indeed, Alphabet’s market capitalisation recently came within touching distance of $4 trillion (€3.45 trillion), not far behind Nvidia and Apple. Google’s reputation has shifted from playing catch-up in AI to the possibility that it’s now setting the pace. How quickly market narratives can change. In July, Nvidia was worth almost twice as much as Alphabet, which at that point sat below Amazon in the rankings and only narrowly ahead of Facebook parent Meta. Just last month, Nvidia was valued at $5 trillion, $2 trillion more than Alphabet. By late November, the gap had shrunk to “just” $300 billion. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s near doubling over the last six months means it’s now worth more than twice as much as Meta. We see a similar dynamic with Apple. A year ago, it was the most valuable firm in the world and was the heavy favourite to become the world’s first $4 trillion company. The narrative changed abruptly; dismissed as an AI laggard, it was overtaken by Microsoft and then swept aside by Nvidia’s surge. [ No matter what AI tells today’s nostalgic teens, life in the 1990s wasn’t all betterOpens in new window ] Now the pendulum has swung again, with Apple recently climbing back to the point where it was within reach of Nvidia’s valuation. What looked like timidity and under-investment in AI now reads like capital discipline – for now anyway. Even with trillion-dollar stocks, stories matter as much as spreadsheets, and stories change all the time. Forecasts about who is ‘winning’ the AI race tend to age poorly.

Title: Google TPUv7: “perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on”

The two best models in the world, Anthropic’s Claude 4.5 Opus and Google’s Gemini 3 have the majority of their training and inference infrastructure on Google’s TPUs and Amazon’s Trainium. Now Google is selling TPUs physically to multiple firms. Is this the end of Nvidia’s dominance? The dawn of the AI era is here, and it is crucial to understand that the cost structure of AI-driven software deviates considerably from traditional software. Chip microarchitecture and system architecture play a vital role in the development and scalability of these innovative new forms of software. The hardware infrastructure on which AI software runs has a notably larger impact on Capex and Opex, and subsequently the gross margins, in contrast to earlier generations of software, where developer costs were relatively larger. Consequently, it is even more crucial to devote considerable attention to optimizing your AI infrastructure to be able to deploy AI software. Firms that have an advantage in infrastructure will also have an advantage in the ability to deploy and scale applications with AI. Google had peddled the idea of building AI-specific infrastructure as far back as 2006, but the problem came to a boiling point in 2013. They realized they needed to double the number of datacenters they had if they wanted to deploy AI at any scale. As such, they started laying the groundwork for their TPU chips which were put into production in 2016. It’s interesting to compare this to Amazon, who in the same year, realized they needed to build custom silicon too. In 2013, they started the Nitro Program, which was focused on developing silicon to optimize general-purpose CPU computing and storage. Two very different companies optimized their efforts for infrastructure for different eras of computing and software paradigms. We’ve long believed that the TPU is among the world’s best systems for AI training and inference, neck and neck with king of the jungle Nvidia. 2.5 years ago we wrote about TPU supremacy, and this thesis has proven to be very correct. TPU’s results speak for themselves: Gemini 3 is one of the best models in the world and was trained entirely on TPUs. In this report, we will talk about the huge changes in Google’s strategy to properly commercialize the TPU for external customers, becoming the newest and most threatening merchant silicon challenger to Nvidia. We plan to: (Re-)Educate our clients and new readers about the rapidly growing commercial success of external TPU customers, starting with Anthropic and extending to Meta, SSI, xAI and even potentially OpenAI... Show that: The more (TPU) you buy, the more (NVIDIA GPU capex) you save! OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPU yet and already increased perf per TCO by getting ~30% off their compute fleet due to competitive threats Explain the circular economy deals for AI Infrastructure. Revisit our original TPU deep dive with a refresher on the TPU hardware stack from silicon down to the software layer. Cover the positive developments on the open software ecosystem front as well as the critical missing ingredient for Google to make the TPU ecosystem a viable challenger to the CUDA moat: open source their XLA:TPU compiler, runtime, and multi-pod “MegaScaler” code. In the paywall, we will discuss the implications for Nvidia’s moat and compare Vera Rubin to the next gen TPUv8AX/8X (aka Sunfish/Zebrafish) Also cover the long term threat to Nvidia. First, let’s talk about the impact this news has had on the ecosystem. TPU performance has clearly caught the attention of its rivals. Sam Altman has acknowledged “rough vibes” ahead for OpenAI as Gemini has stolen the thunder from OpenAI. Nvidia even put out a reassuring PR telling everyone to keep calm and carry on — we are well ahead of the competition. We understand why. These past few months have been win after win for the Google Deepmind, GCP, and TPU complex. The huge upwards revisions to TPU production volumes, Anthropic’s >1GW TPU buildout, SOTA models Gemini 3 and Opus 4.5 trained on TPU, and now an expanding list of clients being targeted (Meta, SSI, xAI, OAI) lining up for TPUs. This has driven a huge re-rating of the Google and TPU supply chain at the expense of the Nvidia GPU-focused supply chain. While the “sudden” emergence of Google and the TPU supply chain has caught many by surprise, SemiAnalysis institutional product subscribers have been anticipating this for the last year. Another reason Nvidia has been on the defensive is a growing chorus of skeptics who argue the company is propping up a “circular economy” by funding cash-burning AI startups, essentially moving money from one pocket to another with extra steps. We think this view is misplaced, but it has clearly struck a nerve inside Nvidia. The finance team issued a detailed response, reproduced below. We think a more realistic explanation is that Nvidia aims to protect its dominant position at the foundation labs by offering equity investment rather than cutting prices, which would lower Gross margins and cause widespread investor panic. Below, we outline the OpenAI and Anthropic arrangements to show how frontier labs can lower GPU TCO by buying, or threatening to buy TPUs. OpenAI hasn’t even deployed TPUs yet and they’ve already saved ~30% on their entire lab wide NVIDIA fleet. This demonstrates how the perf per TCO advantage of TPUs is so strong that you already get the gains from adopting TPUs even before turning one on. Our Accelerator Industry Model, Datacenter Industry Model and Core Research subscribers saw the industry implications well before this was announced and became market consensus. In early August, we shared with our Accelerator Model clients that we saw massive upward revisions for Broadcom / Google TPU orders in the supply chain for 2026. We also revealed that the reason for these order increases was the fact that Google would begin selling systems externally to multiple customers. In early September, we revealed that one of the big external customers will be Anthropic, with demand of at least 1 million TPUs. This was officially confirmed by Anthropic and Google in October. We also called out Meta as a big TPU customer on the 7th of November, weeks before others. In addition we have discussed other customers as well. As a result, our institutional clients have had plenty of heads up on one of the largest performance dispersions in the AI Trade to date. SemiAnalysis was the first to break all these insights because no other research firm can connect the dots from the fabs to supply chain through the datacenters to the labs. To get access to these insights as and stay ahead of the curve: sales@semianalysis.com Onto the deal. The TPU stack has long rivaled Nvidia’s AI hardware, yet it has mostly supported Google’s internal workloads. In typical Google fashion, it never fully commercialized the TPU even after making it available to GCP customers in 2018. That is starting to change. Over the past few months, Google has mobilized efforts across the whole stack to bring TPUs to external customers through GCP or by selling complete TPU systems as a merchant vendor. The search giant is leveraging its strong in-house silicon design capabilities to become a truly differentiated cloud provider. Furthermore, it aligns with marquis customer Anthropic’s continued push to diversify away from its dependence on NVDA. The Anthropic deal marks a major milestone in this push. We understand that GCP CEO Thomas Kurian played a central role in the negotiations. Google committed early by investing aggressively in Anthropic’s funding rounds, even agreeing to no voting rights and a 15% cap on their ownership to expand the use of TPUs beyond internal Google. This strategy was eased by the presence of former DeepMind TPU talent within the foundation lab, resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs. Google has already built a substantial facility for Anthropic, as shown below as part of our building-by-building tracker of AI labs. Beyond renting capacity in Google datacenters through GCP, Anthropic will deploy TPUs in its own facilities, positioning Google to compete directly with Nvidia as a true merchant hardware vendor. In terms of the split of the 1M TPUs: The first phase of the deal covers 400k TPUv7 Ironwoods, worth ~$10 billion in finished racks that Broadcom will sell directly to Anthropic. Anthropic is the fourth customer referenced in Broadcom’s most recent earnings call. Fluidstack, a gold-rated ClusterMax Neocloud provider, will handle on-site setup, cabling, burn-in, acceptance testing, and remote hands work as Anthropic offloads managing physical servers. DC infrastructure will be supplied by TeraWulf (WULF) and Cipher Mining (CIFR). The remaining 600k TPUv7 units will be rented through GCP in a deal we estimate at $42 billion of RPO, accounting for most of the $49 billion increase in GCP’s backlog reported in the third quarter. We believe additional deals with Meta, OAI, SSI, and xAI could provide additional RPO + direct hardware sales for GCP in coming quarters. Despite heavy internal and external demand, Google has not been able to deploy TPUs at the pace it wants. Even though it has more control over its hardware supply than other hyperscalers that still need curry favor with Jensen, Google’s main bottleneck is power. While other hyperscalers have expanded their own sites and secured significant colocation capacity, Google has moved more slowly. We believe the core issue is contractual and administrative. Each new datacenter vendor requires a Master Services Agreement, and these are multibillion-dollar, multiyear commitments that naturally involve some bureaucracy. Yet Google’s process is especially slow, often taking up to three years from initial discussions to a signed MSA. Google’s workaround carries major implications for Neocloud providers and cryptominers looking to pivot to AI DC infrastructure. Instead of leasing directly, Google offers a credit backstop, an off-balance-sheet “IOU” to step in if Fluidstack cannot pay its datacenter rent. Neoclouds like Fluidstack are nimble and flexible, making it easier for them to deal with new datacenter vendors like reformed cryptominers. This mechanic has been key to our bullish views on the cryptomining industry – notably we were calling out numerous including IREN and Applied Digital at the beginning of the year when stock prices were materially lower. The opportunity for miners rests on a simple dynamic: the datacenter industry faces acute power constraints power, and cryptominers already control capacity through their PPAs and existing electrical infrastructure. We expect many more agreements to follow in the coming weeks and quarters. Prior to the Google/Fluidstack/TeraWulf deal, we had not seen any deal with a mere off-balance-sheet “IOU” in the Neocloud market. After the deal, we believe it has become the new de-facto standard financing template. This solves a key headache for Neoclouds looking to secure datacenter capacity and grow their business: A GPU cluster has a useful and economic life of 4-5years A large datacenter lease is typically 15+ years, with a typical payback period of ~8 years. This duration mismatch has made it very complicated for both Neoclouds and Datacenter vendors to secure financing for projects. But with the rise of the “hyperscaler backstop”, we believe the financing issues are solved. We expect a new wave of growth for the NeoCloud industry. Check out our Accelerator and Datacenter models to understand the key beneficiaries. These are the how’s and why’s behind the Anthropic deal, now let’s get into the hardware. Furthermore, Neoclouds who count Jensen as an investor such as CoreWeave, Nebius, Crusoe, Together, Lambda, Firmus, and Nscale all have a notable incentive to not adopt any competing technology in their datacenter: TPUs, AMD GPUs, or even Arista switches are off limits! This leaves a gaping hole in the market for TPU hosting that is currently filled by a combination of crypto miners + Fluidstack. In the coming months, we expect to see more Neoclouds make the tough decision between pursuing a growing TPU hosting opportunity and securing allocations of the latest and greatest Nvidia Rubin systems. The answer is simple. It is a strong chip inside an excellent system, and that combination offers compelling performance and TCO for Anthropic. 2.5 years ago, we wrote about Google’s compute infrastructure advantage. Even with silicon that lagged Nvidia’s on paper, Google’s system-level engineering allowed the TPU stack to match Nvidia in both performance and cost efficiency. We argued then that “systems matter more than microarchitecture,” and the past two years have reinforced that view. Anthropic’s massive TPU orders are a direct validation of the platform’s technical strength. The GPU ecosystem has shifted forward as well. Nvidia’s GB200 represents a major leap forward, pushing Nvidia toward becoming a true systems company that designs full servers rather than only the chip package inside. While we are on the topic of the GB200’s huge innovation in rack-scale interconnect, one underappreciated point is that Google has been scaling up TPUs within and across racks since TPU v2 back in 2017! Further down in the report, we feature a deep dive on Google’s ICI scale-up networking, the only real rival to Nvidia’s NVLink. Google’s recent Gemini 3 model is now viewed as the state of the art frontier LLM. Like all earlier versions of Gemini, it was trained entirely on TPUs. That result offers concrete proof of both TPU capability and Google’s broader infrastructure advantage. Today’s attention often centers on hardware for inference and post-training, yet pre-training a frontier model remains the hardest and most resource-intensive challenge in AI hardware. The TPU platform has passed that test decisively. This stands in sharp contrast to rivals: OpenAI’s leading researchers have not completed a successful full-scale pre-training run that was broadly deployed for a new frontier model since GPT-4o in May 2024, highlighting the significant technical hurdle that Google’s TPU fleet has managed to overcome. One of the key highlights of the new model include noticeable gains in tool calling and agentic capability, especially on longer-horizon tasks for economically valuable tasks. Vending Bench is an evaluation that aims to measure how well models would run a business over a long period of time by placing them as the owner of a simulated vending machine business and Gemini 3 destroyed the competition. This launch brought not just improved capabilities but new products. Antigravity, a product born from the acqui-hire of former Windsurf CEO Varun Mohan and team, is Google’s answer to OpenAI’s Codex, officially entering Gemini into the vibe coding token guzzling wars. For Google to quietly muscle in and establish a performance lead in one of the most challenging hardware problems is a truly impressive feat for a company whose core business isn’t, or should we say, wasn’t in hardware business. The corollary to “Systems matter more than Microarchitecture”, is that while Google has been pushing the boundary on system and networking design, TPU silicon itself wasn’t too ground-breaking. Since then, TPU silicon has made massive strides with the latest generations. From the outset, Google’s design philosophy has been more conservative on silicon relative to Nvidia. Historically, TPUs have shipped with significantly fewer peak theoretical FLOPs, and lower memory specs than corresponding Nvidia GPUs. There are 3 reasons for this. First, Google places a high internal emphasis on ‘RAS’ (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability) for their infrastructure. Google prefers to sacrifice absolute performance in exchange for greater hardware uptime. Running things to the limit means higher instances of hardware mortality which has a real TCO impact in terms of system downtime and hot spares. After all, the hardware you cannot use has infinite TCO relative to performance. The second reason is that up until 2023, Google’s primary AI workload was recommendation system models to power their core Search and Ad properties. RecSys workloads carry much lower arithmetic intensity compared to LLM workloads which means fewer FLOPs are required relative to every bit of data that is transferred. The third comes down to the utility of “peak theoretical FLOPs” numbers that are marketed and how they can be manipulated. Merchant GPU providers like Nvidia and AMD want to market the best performance specifications possible for their chips. This incentivizes them to stretch marketed FLOPs to the highest number possible. In practice, these numbers are unable to be sustained. On the other hand, the TPU has primarily been internal facing, with much less pressure to inflate these specifications externally. This has important implications that we’ll discuss further. The generous way to look at it would be Nvidia is better at DVFS therefore happy to report peak specs only. After we ushered in the LLM era, there has been a clear shift in Google’s TPU design philosophy. We can see that with the 2 most recent TPU generations that were designed-post LLM: TPUv6 Trillium (Ghostlite) and TPUv7 Ironwood (Ghostfish) reflect that change. We can see in the chart below that for TPUv4 and v5, compute throughput was much lower than the Nvidia flagship at the time. TPUv6 came very close to the H100/H200 on FLOPs, but it came 2 years later than the H100. With TPU v7, the gap narrows further with servers available only a few quarters later, while delivering almost the same level of peak theoretical FLOPs. What drove these performance gains? Partially it’s that Google started announcing TPUs as they ramp into production rather then after the next generation was being deployed. Furthermore, TPU v6 Trillium is manufactured on the same N5 node as TPU v5p with similar silicon area but was able to deliver a whopping 2x increase in peak theoretical FLOPs with significantly less power! For Trillium, Google quadrupled the size of each systolic array to 256 x 256 tiles from 128 x 128, and this increase in array size is what has delivered the increase in compute. Trillium was also the last of the “E” (lite) SKUs which meant it was equipped with only 2 sites of HBM3. While Trillium closed the gap to Hopper on compute, it fell far short of the H100/H200 on memory capacity and bandwidth, with only 2 stacks of HBM3 vs 5 and 6 stacks of HBM3 and HBM3E respectively. This made it painful to use for novices, but the performance TCO achieved for Trillium is unbeatable if you get shard your model properly and utilize all those cheap FLOPS. TPU v7 Ironwood is the next iteration where Google nearly completely closes the gap to the corresponding Nvidia flagship GPU on FLOPs, memory, and bandwidth albeit with general availability 1 year later than Blackwell. Compared to the GB200, FLOPs and memory bandwidth only have a slight shortfall, with capacity being the same with 8-Hi HBM3E, which is of course a significant shortfall to GB300 which has 288GB of 12-Hi HBM3E. Theoretical absolute performance is one thing but what matters is real world performance per Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). While Google procures TPUs through Broadcom and pays a hefty margin, it is significantly less than the margin Nvidia earns on not only the GPUs they sell but entire the whole system including CPUs, Switches, NICs, system memory, cabling and connectors. From Google’s perspective this results in the all-in TCO per Ironwood chip for the full 3D Torus configuration being ~44% lower than the TCO of a GB200 server. This more than makes up for the ~10% shortfall on peak FLOPs and peak memory bandwidth. This is from the perspective of Google and the price they procure TPU servers at. What about Google’s external customers when Google adds their margin on top? We assume that in the case where Google earns a margin on leasing TPU 7 to external customers that the TCO per hour can still be up to ~30% lower than the cost of the GB200 and ~41% lower than the cost of the GB300. This is what we believe is reflective of Anthropic’s pricing via GCP. Comparing theoretical FLOPs tells only part of the story. What matters is effective FLOPs, since peak numbers are almost never reached in real-world workloads. In practice, Nvidia GPUs typically achieve only about a small portion of their theoretical peak once communication overhead, memory stalls, power limits, and other system effects are factored in. A good rule of thumb for training is 30%, but utilization also varies heavily by workload. A large share of the gap comes down to software and compiler efficiency. Nvidia’s advantage here stems from the CUDA moat and the wide set of open source libraries that come out of the box, helping workloads run efficiently with high realized FLOPs and memory bandwidth. The TPU software stack is not as easy to use, though this is beginning to change. Inside Google, TPUs benefit from excellent internal tooling that is not exposed to external customers, which makes out of the box performance weaker. However, this only applies to small and/or lazy users, and Anthropic is neither of those. Anthropic has strong engineering resources and ex-Google compiler experts who know both the TPU stack and understand their own model architecture well. They can invest in custom kernels to drive high TPU efficiency. As a result, they can reach substantially higher MFU and much better $/PFLOP performance. We believe that despite lower marketed peak FLOPs, TPUs can reach higher realized Model FLOP Utilization (MFU) than Blackwell, which translates into higher effective FLOPs for Ironwood. A major reason is that marketed GPU FLOPs from Nvidia and AMD are significantly inflated. Even in tests designed to maximize throughput through GEMMs shaped far from real workloads, Hopper only reached about ~80% of peak, Blackwell landed in the 70s, and AMD’s MI300 series in the 50s-60s. The limiting factor is power delivery. These chips cannot sustain the clock speeds used in the peak math. Nvidia and AMD implement Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling which means that the chip’s clock frequency is dynamically adjusted based on power consumption and thermals rather than a stable clock frequency that can actually be sustained. Nvidia and AMD then select the highest clock frequency that could possibly be delivered, even if very intermittently, to be used in the calculation of peak theoretical FLOPs (operations per cycle per ALU x number of ALUs x cycles per second i.e. clock frequency). There are other tricks that are employed, like running GEMMs on tensors filled with zeroes, as 0x0=0, the transistors don’t need to switch state from 0 to 1, therefore reducing the power draw of each operation. Of course, in the real world, zero-filled tensors are not multiplied together. When we put together much lower TCO and higher effective FLOPs utilization, from the perspective of Google the $ per effective FLOP becomes much cheaper, with ~15% MFU being the breakeven with GB300 at 30% MFU. This means if Google (or Anthropic) manages to hit half the FLOPs utilization of GB300, they still come out even. Of course, with Google’s elite compiler engineer team and deep understanding of their own models, the MFU they can realize on TPUs could be 40% potentially. That would be a whopping ~62% reduction in cost per effective training FLOP! However, when looking at the 600K rented TPUs, when we incorporate the higher TCO that Anthropic pays (ie inclusive of Google’s margin stacking) into this analysis, we estimate the cost to Anthropic to be $1.60 per TPU-hour from GCP, narrowing the TCO advantage. We believe that Anthropic can realize 40% MFU on TPUs due to both their focus on performance optimization as well as the TPU’s marketed FLOPs inherently being more realistic. This provides Anthropic with a staggering ~52% lower TCO per effective PFLOP compared to GB300 NVL72. The equilibrium where TCO per effective FLOP compared to the GB300 baseline is the same is at a much lower 19% extracted MFU for Anthropic. This means that Anthropic can suffer a sizeable performance shortfall relative to the baseline GB300 and the perf/TCO for training FLOPs still ends up being the same as the baseline Nvidia system. FLOPs are not the end all and be all for performance, memory bandwidth is super important for inference, especially on the bandwidth intensive decode step. It should be no surprise that $ per memory bandwidth for the TPU also ends up being much cheaper than GB300. There is significant evidence that at small message sizes such as 16MB to 64MB (loading an expert of a single layer), TPU’s even achieve higher memory bandwidth utilization then GPUs. All of this translates into more efficient compute to train and serve a model. Anthropic’s release of Opus 4.5 continued the usual focus on coding, setting a new SWE-Bench record. The main surprise was a ~67% price cut on the API. This price cut paired with the lower verbosity and higher token efficiency of the model compared to Sonnet (76% fewer tokens to match Sonnet’s best score, and 45% fewer to exceed it by 4 points) means Opus 4.5 is the best model for coding use cases and could effectively raise Anthropic’s realized token pricing as Sonnet is over 90% of token mix today. When it comes to pricing for external customers, Google needs to thread the needle to balance their own profitability whilst offering customers a competitive proposition. Our estimate for Anthropic pricing is on the lower end of ranges we’ve heard for external pricing. For a flagship customer such as Anthropic, who will provide valuable input into both the software and hardware roadmap whilst ordering a huge amount of volumes, we’d expect sweetheart pricing. While Nvidia’s eye-watering 4x markup (~75% gross margin) offers a lot of room for pricing flexibility, a good amount of oxygen is sucked away by Broadcom. Broadcom, as the TPU’s co-designer, earns a high margin on the silicon which is the largest component of system BOM. Still, this leaves a lot of room for Google to earn very good acceptable margins. We can see this from comparing the GCP Anthropic deal to other large GPU-based cloud deals. Note that this is looking at the 600k TPUs that is being rented with the remaining 400k TPU v7 chips being bought upfront by Anthropic. Under these assumptions, the TPU v7 economics show superior EBIT margins than the other large GPU-based cloud deals we have observed, with only OCI-OpenAI coming close. Even with Broadcom’s margin stack on the chip-level BOM, Google can still eke out far superior margins and returns than much more commoditized GPU deals. This is where the TPU stack allows GCP to be a truly differentiated CSP. Meanwhile someone like Microsoft Azure, whose ASIC program is struggling, is confined to earning more mediocre returns in the mere business of leasing merchant hardware. We’ve so far discussed how TPUs compare to Nvidia GPUs, focusing on per chip specs and the shortcomings. Now, let’s get back to the system discussion which is where TPU’s capabilities really start to diverge. One of the most distinctive features of the TPU is its extremely large scale up world size through the ICI protocol. The world size of a TPU pod reaches 9216 Ironwood TPUs, with large pod sizes being a feature of TPUs as early as TPUv2 back in 2017 scaling up to a full 256 1024-chip cluster size. Let’s start at the rack level, the basic building block of each TPU superpod. The TPU rack has a similar design over the last couple of generations. Each rack consists of 16 TPU Trays, 16 or 8 Host CPU Trays depending on the cooling configuration, a ToR Switch, power supply units, and BBUs. Each TPU tray consists of 1 TPU board with 4 TPU chip packages mounted. Each Ironwood TPU will have 4 OSFP cages for ICI connections and 1 CDFP PCIe cage for the connection to the Host CPU. Google has been implementing liquid cooled TPU racks since TPU v3 in 2018, but there are still some TPU generations in between that were designed to be air-cooled. The main difference between the liquid cooled and the air-cooled rack is that the air-cooled rack has 2 TPU trays to 1 host CPU tray ratio while the liquid cooled rack has a 1 to 1 ratio instead. An innovative design of TPU’s liquid cooling is that the flow rate of the coolant is actively controlled by the valves. This enables much more efficient cooling as the flow can be adjusted depending on the amount of workload that each chip has at any given time. Google’s TPU has also long adopted vertical power delivery, in which the VRM modules of the TPUs are on the other side of the PCB board. These VRM modules also require a cold plate for cooling. Overall, the TPU rack design is much simpler than that of the Nvidia Oberon NVL72 design, which has a much higher density and utilizes a backplane to connect GPUs to scale up switches. The scale up connections between the TPU trays are all over external copper cables or optics, which will be explained in the ICI section below. The connection between the TPU tray and the CPU tray is also over PCIe DAC cable. The building block of Google’s ICI scale-up network for TPUv7 is a 4x4x4 3D torus consisting of 64 TPUs. Each 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs maps to one physical rack of 64 TPUs. This is an ideal dimension as all 64 TPUs can be connected electrically to each other and still fit in a physical rack. The TPUs are connected to each other in a 3D torus configuration, with each TPU connecting to 6 neighbors total – 2 logically adjacent neighboring TPUs for each of the X, Y and Z axes. Each TPU is always connected to 2 other TPUs via PCB traces within the compute tray but depending on where the TPU is located within the 4x4x4 cube, it will connect to 4 other neighbors either via Direct Attach Copper (DAC) cables or via an Optical Transceiver. Connections within the interior of the 4x4x4 cube happen over copper, while connections outside of the 4x4x4 cube (including wrap-around connections back to the other side of the cube as well as connections to neighboring 4x4x4 cubes) will use optical transceivers and OCSs. In the below diagram, we see that as this is a 3D Torus network: TPU 2,3,4 (on the Z+ face) has a wraparound connection back to the opposite Z-axis face to TPU 2,3,1 (on the Z- face) using an 800G optical transceiver and routing through an OCS. As mentioned above, in addition to the 2 neighboring TPUs that are always connected via PCB traces, TPUs will connect to 4 other neighbors using DACs, transceivers or a mix of both depending on where in the 4x4x4 cube they are. TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube will connect to the 4 other neighbors exclusively using DACs, TPUs on the face of the cube will connect via 3 DACs and 1 optical transceiver, TPUs on the edge of the cube will connect via 2 optical transceivers and 2 DACs, while TPUs on the corners will connect via 1 DAC and 3 optical transceivers. You can remember how many transceivers a given TPU will use by looking at how many of the TPU’s sides are facing the “outside” of the cube. The diagram above, as well as the table below, summarizes the number of respective location types for TPUs and can be used to derive the attach ratio of 1.5 Optical Transceivers per TPU v7. These transceivers connect to Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs) which enable connections between 4x4x4 cubes – more on that in the next section. Google adopts a software-defined networking approach to manage network routes through Optical Circuit Switches (OCSs). An NxN OCS is basically a massive train station with N tracks in and N tracks out. Any train coming in can be transferred to any train coming out, but this has to be reconfigured at the station. Trains cannot be “looped back” or sent back on another N track in, they must be routed only to one of the N tracks out. The benefit of this approach is that the network can assemble smaller logical TPU slices – for different workloads from the theoretical maximum of 9,216 chips in the ICI network layer. By rerouting ICI paths around faults in the network through slicing a larger cluster, cluster availability improves. Unlike Electronic Packet Switching (EPS) switches such as an Arista Tomahawk 5 where there is a fixed total bandwidth that is further split into several ports of smaller bandwidth sizes, OCSs allow any bandwidth of optical fiber to be connected to its ports. OCSs is also low latency compared to EPSs because optical signals entering an OCS simply bounce from the input port to the output port. For EPSs, optical signals must be converted to electrical signals when entering the switch – one key reason why an OCS is typically more power efficient than an EPS. An EPS also allows routing of packets from any port to any port, while an OCS only allows you to route an “in” port to any other “out” port only. OCS ports only route individual fiber strands. This becomes a challenge for standard duplex transceivers because bandwidth is transmitted over multiple fiber strands, which reduces the effective radix and bandwidth of the OCS. To solve this problem, an FR optical transceiver is used to consolidate all wavelengths onto a single fiber strand to be connected to 1 OCS port. The Apollo Project innovatively achieved this in two steps. First, the 8 wavelengths – 1 wavelength for each 100G lane – are multiplexed through Coarse Wave Division Multiplexing (CWDM8) to transmit 800G over a single fiber pair, instead of 8 fiber pairs. Second, an optical circulator is integrated on the wave division multiplexing (WDM) transceiver to enable full duplex data flow, reducing requirements from 1 fiber pair to only 1 fiber strand. The circulator forms a bi-directional link by combining the Tx and Rx fiber strands at the transceiver onto a single fiber strand that is sent to the OCS switch. Google’s ICI scale-up network is unique in that it allows the connection of multiple 64 TPU 4x4x4 Cubes together in a 3D torus configuration to create massive world sizes. The TPUv7 has a stated maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs but today, Google supports the configuration of TPUs into multiple different slice sizes of between 4 TPUs all the way up to 2,048 TPUs. While Google can innovatively achieve an impressive scale-up cluster of 9,216 TPUs, the benefit of running training workloads on incrementally larger block sizes of up to approximately 8,000 TPUs at any point in time decreases. This is because larger block sizes are more prone to failures and disruption, therefore decreasing slice availability, which is defined by the fraction of time in which the ICI cluster is able to form a contiguous 3D torus slice. For slices that can fit entirely within a 4x4x4 Cube, we can simply carve these slices out of that cube using the copper interconnects within the rack as well as the optical transceivers on the face/edge/corner of the cube to wrap around and complete the 3D Torus if needed.To see how wraparound and inter-cube connections are made, let’s start by looking at how we would create a 64 TPU slice in a 4x4x4 topography. We can use the unit 4x4x4 cube of 64 TPUs corresponding to one physical 64 TPU rack to build up this topography. All 8 TPUs in the interior of the 4x4x4 cube can fully connect to all 6 neighbors using copper. If a TPU does not have an interior neighbor along a given axis, it will wrap around and connect to a TPU on the opposite side of the cube. For example, TPU 4,1,4 has no interior neighbor in the Z+ direction, so it will use one 800G optical transceiver to connect to an OCS assigned to the Z-axis, with the OCS configured to direct this connection to the Z- side of the cube, connecting to TPU 4,1,1. In the Y- direction, TPU 1,1,1 will use an optical transceiver to connect to a Y-axis OCS to link to the Y+ side of TPU 1,4,1 and so on. Each face of the 4x4x4 cube will connect via 16 different OCSs – one OCS for each TPU on each face. For example, in the diagram below, on the X+ face, TPU 4,3,2 connects to the input side of OCS X,3,2. OCS X,3,2’s input side will also connect to the same TPU Index (4,3,2) on the X+ face of all 144 4x4x4 Cubes in the 9,216 TPU cluster. OCS X,3,2’s output side will then connect to the same TPU Index for every single cube in the cluster except this time on the X- face – so it will connect to TPU 1,3,2 on all 144 cubes of the cluster. The diagram below illustrates how all 16 TPUs on the X+ face of Cube A connect via 16 OCSs to 16 TPUs on the X- of Cube B. These connections allow any “+” face of any cube to connect to the “-“ face of any other cube, enabling complete fungibility of cubes when forming slices. There are two constraints to briefly point out. First, TPUs of one Index on a given face can never connect directly to a different index – so TPU 4,3,2 could never be configured to connect to TPU 1,2,3. Second, as the OCS essentially acts as a patch panel – TPUs connected on the input side cannot “loop back” to connect to any other TPU that is also connected on the input side of the OCS - as an example, TPU 4,3,2 can never connect to TPU 4,3,3. So – any TPU on the “+” face can never connect to the “+” face of any other cube, and any TPU on the “-” face can never connect to the “-” face of any other cube. Let’s go larger and see how a 4x4x8 Topography could be set up. In this configuration, we extend the slice by connecting two 64 TPU 4x4x4 cubes along the Z-axis. In this case, the OCS will reconfigure the optical port that TPU 4,1,4 is connected to so that it now connects to TPU 4,1,5 instead of wrapping around back to TPU 4,1,1 as was the case for a standalone 4x4x4 topography. Extending this, we will have 16 optical connections extending from the Z- and Z+ faces of each of the two 4x4x4 TPU cubes, for a total of 64 Fiber strands connected into 16 Z-Axis OCSs. It is important to remind readers that Cube A and Cube B depicted below are not necessarily physically located next to each other. Instead, they are connected via OCSs and they could each be in completely different locations in the datacenter. We will now move to a much larger topology – the 16x16x16 topology, which brings us up to 4,096 TPUs. In this topology, we use a total of 48 OCSs to connect 64 Cubes of 64 TPUs each. In the diagram below, each multi-colored cube represents one 64 TPU 4x4x4 cube. Taking the bottom right 4x4x4 cube as an example – this cube is connected to adjacent cubes along the Y-axis via OCSs. The maximum world size of 9,216 TPUs is built up using 144 4x4x4 cubes requiring 96 optical connections each amounting to a total requirement of 13,824 ports. Dividing this total port requirement by 288 (144 input and 144 output ports on each OCS) means we need 48 144x144 OCSs to support this maximum world size. But what is so great about Google’s unique ICI scale-up network – other than all the fancy cube diagrams one can spend countless hours drawing? World Size: The most obvious benefit is the very large 9,216 TPU maximum world size that the TPUv7 Ironwood supports. Even though the maximum slice size of 9,216 may rarely be used due to the drawback of diminished goodput, slices of thousands of TPUs can and are commonly used. This is far larger than the 64 or 72 GPU world size that is common in the merchant accelerator market and for other custom silicon providers. Reconfigurable and Fungibility: The use of OCSs mean that the network topology inherently supports the reconfiguration of network connections to support a high number of different topologies – in theory thousands of topologies. Google’s documentation site lists out 10 different combinations (image earlier in this section), but these are only the most common 3D slice shapes – there are many more available. Even slices of the same size can be reconfigured differently. In the simple example of a Twisted 2D Torus diagrammed below, we see how looping across to an index of a different X coordinate instead of an index of the same X coordinate can reduce the worst-case number of hops and the worst-case bisection bandwidth. This can help improve all to all collective throughput. A TPUv7 cluster will twist at the 4x4x4 cube level. Reconfigurability also opens the door to a broad diversity of parallelisms. In a 64 or 72 GPU world size, different parallelism combinations are generally limited to the factors of 64. When it comes to the ICI scale-up network, the possibilities for implementing topologies to precisely match the combination of data parallelism, tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism desired are plentiful. The fact that OCSs allow one to connect any “+” face of any cube to the “-“ face of any other cube means that there is complete fungibility of cubes. Slices can be formed out of any set of cubes. So if there are any faults or change in user demands or usage, this will not obstruct the formation of new topology slices. Lower Cost: Google’s ICI network has a lower cost than most switched scale-up networks. Though the FR optics used can be slightly expensive due to the use of circulators, the mesh network reduces the overall number of switches and ports that are needed and eliminates cost arising from connections between switches. Low Latency and Better Locality: The use of direct links between TPUs means that it is possible to achieve much lower latency for TPUs that are physically located close to one another or are reconfigured to connect directly to each other. TPUs that are close to each other also have better data locality. The Datacenter Network (DCN) is a network separate to ICI that serves the role of both a typical backend and front-end network. It connects across an even larger domain – 147k TPUs in the case of TPUv7 clusters. As discussed in our earlier post on Mission Apollo, where Google proposed replacing the Electronic Packet Switch (EPS)-containing spine layer of the traditional “Clos” architecture with Paloma Optical Circuit Switches (OCS), Google’s DCN consists of an optically switched Datacenter Network Interconnect (DCNI) layer that combines several aggregation blocks, each of which connects several 9,216 TPU ICI clusters. In 2022, Google’s Apollo project proposed a DCN architecture that described using 136x136 OCS switches for TPUv4 pods with a pod size of 4,096 TPUs. OCS switches at the DCNI layer were organized into 4 Apollo zones, each containing a maximum of 8 racks of 8 OCS switches for a total of 256 OCS switches. When it comes to Ironwood, to support up to 147k TPUv7s on the same network, we hypothesize that the number of ports on the OCS will nearly double as opposed to increasing the maximum number of OCS switches.The diagram below illustrates what an Ironwood DCN network using 32 racks holding 256 300x300 OCS switches could look like. Assuming that there is no oversubscription between the spine layers of each aggregation block, a maximum of 16 ICI pods can be connected in the DCN with 4 aggregation blocks connecting 4 ICI pods each – a total of 147,456 TPUs. The DCNI layer connects the 4 aggregation blocks – depicted as the top layer in the diagram below. As with ICI, FR Optics are used to connect to the OCSs in order to maximize bandwidth per port on each OCS. While existing Ironwood clusters may only have 1 or 2 aggregation blocks, Google DCN’s unique architecture allows for new aggregation blocks of TPUs to be added to the network without significant rewiring. By using OCSs for the DCNI layer, the size of the DCN fabric can be incrementally expanded and the network can be re-striped to support new aggregation blocks. Furthermore, the bandwidth of aggregation blocks can be upgraded without having to change the make-up of the DCN layer. This allows the link speeds of existing aggregation blocks to be refreshed without changing the fundamental architecture of the network itself. The process of fabric expansion cannot go on indefinitely – at significant scale, it becomes unmanageable to rewire the network. Traditionally, TPU software and hardware teams have been internal-facing. This comes with advantages such as the absence of pressure by marketing teams to inflate stated theoretical FLOPs. Another advantage of being only internal facing is that the TPU teams heavily prioritized internal feature requests & optimizing internal workloads. The disadvantage is that they did not care much about external customers or workloads. The number of external developers in the TPU ecosystem is way lower than in the CUDA ecosystem. This is one of the main weaknesses of the TPU as it is with all non-Nvidia accelerators. Google has since revised their software strategy for externally-facing customers and has already made major changes to their TPU team’s KPIs and how they approach contributing to the AI/ML ecosystem. There are 2 major changes that we will discuss: Massive engineering effort on PyTorch TPU “native” support Massive engineering effort on vLLM/SGLang TPU support The externalization strategy is clear to see by looking at the number of contributions from various TPU software repos by Google. We can see a noticeable increase in vLLM contributions starting from March. Then from May, the “tpu-inference” repo was created which is the official vLLM TPU unified back-end, and since then there has been a flurry of activity. Traditionally, Google only had first class support on the Jax/XLA:TPU stack (and TensorFlow/TF-Mesh RIP), but treated PyTorch on TPU as second class citizen. It relied on lazy tensor graph capture through PyTorch/XLA instead of having a first-class eager execution mode. Furthermore, it did not support PyTorch native distributed APIs (torch.distributed.*) or support PyTorch native parallelism APIs (DTensor, FSDP2, DDP, etc), but relied on weird out of tree XLA SPMD APIs (torch_xla.experimental.spmd_fsdp, torch_xla.distributed.spmd, etc.). This has led to a subpar non-native experience for external users that are used to the native PyTorch CUDA backend on GPUs and trying to switch to TPUs. In October, Google’s “Captain Awesome” Robert Hundt quietly announced in the XLA repo that they will be moving away from a non-native lazy tensor backend towards a “native” TPU PyTorch backend that will support eager execution by default & integration with torch.compile & DTensor & torch.distributed APIs, etc. They will be doing this through the use of PrivateUse1 TorchDispatch key. This will mainly be done for Meta who has renewed interest in buying TPUs & does not want to move to JAX. It will also make it for people that enjoy PyTorch and do not like JAX to use TPUs too. Previously from 2020 to 2023, heavily used by a couple of teams at Meta FAIR used PyTorch XLA on TPUs but it was not widely adopted thus Meta leadership ended up cancelling the contracts in 2023. PyTorch XLA on TPUs is not a fun experience. The Meta FAIR GCP TPUs back then were even run using SLURM and not anything typical you would find on TPU stack like GKE/Xmanager/borg/etc. This new PyTorch <> TPU will create a smoother transition for ML scientists that are used to PyTorch on GPUs to switch to PyTorch on TPUs and take advantage of the higher performance per TCO on TPUs. Pallas is the kernel authoring language for writing custom kernels for TPU (similar to cuTile or Triton or CuTe-DSL). Meta & Google have also started work on supporting Pallas kernels as a codegen target for the Torch Dynamo/Inductor compile stack. This will allow for native TPU integration with PyTorch’s native torch.compile API & allow for end users to register custom pallas ops into PyTorch. In addition to the core in tree PyTorch native APIs, there is also work behind the scenes on integrating TPU pallas kernel language as a codegen target for Helion. You can think of Helion as a higher-level language for writing decently performing kernels in a high level language. Users can think about Helion as a low level Aten operators rather than as high level Triton/Pallas due to its similarity matching much closer to the Native PyTorch Aten ops. Another area where the CUDA ecosystem is supreme is for open ecosystem inference. Historically, vLLM & SGLang support CUDA as first class (as ROCm as 2nd class citizen). Now Google wants in to the vLLM & SGlang open inference ecosystem and have announced beta TPU v5p/v6e support for vLLM & SGLang through a very “unique” integration. vLLM& SGLang currently does this by lowering the PyTorch modelling code into JAX and taking advantage of the existing mature JAX TPU compilation flow. In the future once PyTorch XLA RFC #9684 (aka native TPU PyTorch backend) gets implemented, vLLM & SGLang plan on evaluating whether to switch to using that instead of translating modelling from PyTorch to JAX through TorchAX. Google & vLLM claim that this lowering to jax path does not require any changes to the PyTorch modelling code but given how few models vLLM TPU supports so far, we doubt this is true. Furthermore, Google has open-sourced & integrated some of their TPU kernels into vLLM such as a TPU optimized paged attention kernels, compute-comms overlapped GEMM kernels & a couple other quantized matmul kernels. They do not yet have MLA-friendly TPU kernels. It would be interesting to see once Inductor Pallas TPU codegen integration is more mature, whether it is possible to integrate kernel fusion & pattern matching into the existing vLLM PassManager. SGLang is also looking into implementing an torch.compile PassManager to make managing kernel fusions for many models more maintainable. For Ragged Paged Attention v3, TPU handles it quite differently from vLLM GPU. vLLM manages KV cache with a technique similar to virtual memory and paging. However, this technique requires fetching dynamic addresses and performing scatter operations, something TPUs don’t support well. As a result, TPU kernels leverage fine-grained operation pipelining. Specifically, TPU’s page attention kernel prefetches query and KV blocks for the next sequence, so the memory loading is overlapped with computation. In the existing vLLM MoE kernel, we sort tokens by expert ID, dispatch tokens to the devices with the corresponding experts, perform group matrix multiplication, and combine tokens from experts back to original devices. However, the kernel performs poorly for two reasons: TPUs are slow at performing sorting operations, and the kernel is unable to overlap communication with computation. To work around this issue, Google developers designed all-fused MoE. All-fused MoE dispatches tokens for one expert per device at a time while overlapping MoE dispatch & MoE combine communications & avoiding sorting tokens by expert ID. With all-fused MoE, the Google engineer reported 3 - 4x speedup over existing kernels. Furthermore, another hardware unit in TPUs is the SparseCore (SC) used to accelerate embedding lookups and updates. SC comes with a scalar subcore SparseCore Sequencer (SCS) and multiple vector subcores SparseCore Tiles (SCT). SCT supports local and remote direct memory access at a more fine-grained 4-byte or 32-byte granularity, compared to TPU TensorCore’s 512-byte loads. This enables SC to perform gather/scatter operations and ICI communications while overlapping with TensorCore operations. At JAX DevLabs, we learned that programmability of SparseCore is a work in progress. We can expect Mosaic, the TPU custom kernel compiler, to compile in an MPMD fashion, where SCS and SCT executes different kernels, and different SparseCores can run different programs. We suspect once the programmability catches up, TPU MoE kernels would be able to perform dispatch and combine operations in a similar way as GPUs, instead of dispatching by expert IDs. In terms of disaggregated prefill decode, which we described in depth in our AMD 2.0 post, Google has experimental support on vLLM for single host disagg PD, not they do not support multi-host wideEP disagg prefill or MTP yet. These inference optimizations are critical to lower the TCO per million tokens and increase the perf per dollar and perf per watt. Furthermore, they have not yet integrated TPU vLLM inference support into popular RL frameworks like VERL, etc. Google is slowly moving in the correct direction in terms of how they approach the open AI/ML ecosystem especially for their “native” TPU backend. This week, there was an new inference benchmark on TPUv6e that dropped claiming that TPUv6e has 5x worst performance per dollar than NVIDIA GPUs. We disagree mainly due to 2 reasons. First of all, this is benchmark is on vLLM on TPUs which was only released an couple month ago thus does not yet have optimized performance. Google internal Gemini workloads & Anthropic workloads work on an internal custom inference stack that has better perf per TCO than NVIDIA GPUs. Secondly, Aritifical Analysis’s cost per million tokens is using the list price of $2.7/hr/chip for TPUv6e. No major customers of TPUs is paying anywhere close to that much for TPUv6e given the BOM is a tiny fraction of the H100. As everyone knows, most clouds have an high ball list price such that their account sales executives can do “car salesman” tactics and give massive discounts so that the customer thinks they are getting a good deal. The SemiAnalysis AI TCO Model tracks the acutal market rental price of TPUs across all the various contract lengths (1 month, 1 year, 3 years, etc). One part where Google is still approaching their software strategy incorrectly is with their XLA graph compiler & networking libraries & TPU runtime is still not open sourced nor well documented. This has led to frustrated users across the spectrum from advanced users to the average user of not being able to debug what is going wrong with their code. Furthermore their MegaScale codebase for multi-pod training is not open source either. We strongly believe that in order to accelerate the adoption, Google should open source it and the increased user adoption will outweigh all the software IP they will make public & free. Just like how PyTorch or Linux being open sourced rapidly increased adoption, open sourcing XLA:TPU & TPU runtime & networking libs will rapidly accelerated this too. Now that Google has gotten their act together on TPU and is selling them externally for people to put in their own datacenters, what are the implications on Nvidia’s business? Does Nvidia finally have a legitimate competitor that will put its market share and margins at threat? Behind the paywall, we will share our thoughts on what this means for Nvidia as well as reveal more about the TPU roadmap.

More Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday falls on Dec. 1 this year, which means it is today. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales are live across the biggest retailers. However, the day is almost over, and deals are already disappearing. If you've got your eye on something, now is the time to shop. Almost all major retailers offer tons of deals and discounts for Cyber Monday. Think of companies like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as more specialized retailers such as B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can also run out of stock, so there are pros and cons to shopping in‑store and online. Cyber Monday sales are running right now, but they won't linger much longer. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and although that's now behind us, plenty of fresh discounts have been rolling in for Cyber Monday. But as the day starts winding down, so will the sales. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We’ve rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll highlight the best deals we find throughout the event. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive -- the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

Title: Analysis: OpenAI is a loss-making machine, with estimates that it has no road to profitability by 2030 — and will need a further $207 billion in funding even if it gets there

Don't call it a bubble! Loss-making monster OpenAI is on the hook for $1.4 trillion (with a T) in compute commitments, as companies start turning to debt to fund the AI craze. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Enjoy our content? Make sure to set Windows Central as a preferred source in Google Search, and find out why you should so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more. Don't call it a bubble, friends! You can't move five pixels on the internet without being hit with something AI related these days (my apologies for contributing there). Whether it's bad memes on your Instagram feed or AI-powered bots flooding X, or even nation states turning to AI to write government policy — AI has become the tech craze du jour and will likely remain that way for the foreseeable. Microsoft has bet heavily on OpenAI to fuel its own AI efforts, spearheaded by Microsoft Copilot. So far, Copilot has been something of a dud for any serious real-world use case, requiring constant human intervention to fact check and correct errors. Much the same is true for Google Gemini, Grok, and other artificial intelligence platforms, which so far seem to have found a niche as expensive meme creation tools — nowhere near providing the promised productivity boost. That isn't stopping the speculation, though. The assumption is that one day large language models (LLMs) and other related AI technologies fostered by Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT actually will be a great and infallible productivity tool for genuine work. It already is decent for providing basic overviews of highly-covered, well-sourced topics, even as hallucinations and sycophancy continue to dog the tech, particularly in situations where accountability is more critical. Despite today's downsides, many companies are salivating at the idea of cheap virtual humans replacing real humans who need money to eat and time to sleep. Big Tech is racing to meet this possibility with panicked fervour, and recent analyses from FT and HSBC (via Fortune) suggest that things are potentially getting a bit ... irrational. Recent data shows that companies are increasingly relying on debt, rather than real revenue and cashflow to fund commitments to OpenAI and vice-versa. OpenAI has made a truly staggering $1.4 trillion (with a T) in commitments for compute to meet its projected needs, despite posting a "paltry" $20 billion in revenues this annum. To put it into context, $20 billion represents just 1.43~% of that $1.4 trillion commitment. It's a truly insane gap. OpenAI is exploring a range of revenue-generating initiatives to change its fortunes, including in-line ads within ChatGPT. Although a lot of it revolves around replacing human workers with AI, particularly in hospitality and customer service sectors. It would be theoretically far cheaper for very large companies to replace their human workers with ChatGPT, even if those contracts cost millions. That is, if it can provide customers with a satisfactory experience. Gartner previously projected that many companies turning to AI to replace workers are already reversing course. But I digress. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. HSBC projects that even if OpenAI is making $200 billion by 2030, it would still need a staggering $207 billion in funding to stay afloat. As OpenAI scales, so does its costs. Its expensive frontier models like Sora 2 and GPT-5 cost millions of dollars a day to run, requiring enormous amounts of compute. These models are given away at cost in attempts to drive adoption, create lock-in, and essentially alter human behavior. You can think of it similarly to Spotify, which spent well over a decade completely unprofitable until it had basically re-written the way humans consume music and how labels distribute music. OpenAI is trying to achieve a similar result on a far, far larger, and potentially far more damaging scale. Spotify collapsing wouldn't have had any impact on the global economy. But, if we get to a point where it seems the economics of "AI" and LLMs simply don't work — it could have a similar impact on markets to the dot com bubble or the credit crunch. There's simply so much invested in these companies and initiatives right now, that inability to service the debt would trigger a wave of instability. Whether it's power constraints, model inbreeding damaging long-term viability of data quality, or simply because it actually sucks and is nothing more than a novelty — it could be the case that AI is simply not destined to make real money. This is one reason why Microsoft has been focusing on efficiency and low-power consumption in its home-grown MAI models. Microsoft has focused its efforts on the constraints of global compute and energy markets as the tech's biggest bottleneck. But, like others, it's betting the bulk of its AI future on OpenAI, and that bet is exactly that. A gamble. The fragility of this whole ecosystem is increasingly coming to light. FT reports that of the $1.4 trillion compute commitments OpenAI has made, its partners are actually turning to debt themselves to meet those demands. Softbank, Oracle, CoreWeave, Blue Owl Capital, Crusoe, Vantage, and other venture capital firms and cloud providers have taken on a staggering $96 billion in debt in 2025 to give OpenAI the compute it's asking for. OpenAI is reportedly on the hook to meet these commitments whether or not demand materializes, too. The commitments are spread across the next eight years, and could trigger a cash flow crisis if OpenAI fails to find the funding to pay up. HSBC's most optimistic estimates suggest that OpenAI will hit 3 billion weekly active users by 2030, with 300 million of those paying a subscription. Even with this scale, Microsoft and other OpenAI partners could be on the hook to plough hundreds of billions more into OpenAI to keep it cash flow positive. OpenAI recently restructured its deal with Microsoft to that end, to help it find other sources of revenue and compute. Some of this analysis likely excludes fresh constraints, too, like the DRAM price crisis AI has triggered. Compute is going to get more expensive, not less expensive, with wafer and silicon capacity fully constrained. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella recently explained how the company is leaving compute on the literal shelf because it physically can't source the electricity it needs to meet demand. Will Microsoft et al. need to become energy suppliers on top of server companies? There's also no guarantee that energy costs in general will remain stable either, as global politics and climate change also continue to play a role. OpenAI and other AI companies have been lobbying to make LLMs a matter of national security to that end, seeking full-blown government backing and guarantees. The delicate balance of debt and speculation threatens to wipe out billions if connected companies default and become insolvent, which will drive a wave of corrections hitting the biggest players like NVIDIA and Microsoft. All of this falls apart if humans don't adopt the tech. This is why you've seen Meta cram its lame chatbots into WhatsApp and Instagram. This is why Notepad and Paint now have useless Copilot buttons on Windows. This is why Google Gemini wants to "help you" read and reply to your emails. They're trying to change our habits, because all of the projections rely on people becoming truly dependent on the technology. Whether or not it's actually a good thing for society isn't considered to be a factor. They're forcing it on us because if we don't use it, if we don't subscribe to it, buy products through it, or click on ads through it — the debt structure will inevitably implode. It will wipe out billions in unpaid loans. And as usual, the banks will be bailed out, and the tax payer will have to foot the bill. Higher costs, decreased employment opportunities, higher interest rates, and likely another round of sticky inflation. But hey, I'm sure all the big players will have cashed out their stocks way before any of that happens. In reality, LLM technology is here to stay, but the constraints are becoming untenable. The efficacy and efficiency of the models at hyperscales has become the real bottleneck. Electricity and water requirements are impacting tax payers. Crucially, will people ever want to pay for this stuff? It's not ideal that OpenAI's success may depend on big companies using it to replace human workers at huge scales. How will people pay for OpenAI if nobody has a job? Where will OpenAI get its training data if the human-led information economy falls apart? The business model seems like a bit of a negative feedback loop, at least on the face of it. Costs will have to come down rapidly in my view for any of this to actually work. It probably won't be LLM research alone that fuels the next wave of innovation as a result, but energy and server technology breakthroughs. But that's an exploration for another article. Will OpenAI and others hit the profitability before the debt bubble bursts? It'll be interesting to see what the next five years brings.

Title: The Best Black Friday 2025 VR Headset Discounts & Deals
URL: https://www.uploadvr.com/best-black-friday-2025-vr-headset-deals/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T22:05:25Z

Considering jumping into VR this Black Friday, or gifting a headset to a friend or relative so they can join you? Here are the best deals available. Meta Quest headsets are the ideal way to get into VR and mixed reality for most people. They are fully standalone, meaning you don't need any external device (other than a phone app to initially set them up), and they can also wirelessly connect to SteamVR on a gaming PC, if you have one, for a higher fidelity experience. There are currently two headsets in Meta's lineup, the budget Quest 3S and the higher-end Quest 3. Quest 3S is normally $300, while Quest 3 is normally $500. The excellent Black Friday 2025 deals for Quest 3S offer both a lower price and added perks, making it an ideal holiday gift, while there's only one Quest 3 deal we're aware of, and it only offers a perk. Still, if you have the funds, we always recommend the proper Quest 3. While Quest 3S reuses the old fresnel lenses from Quest 2, Quest 3 features Meta's advanced pancake lenses which are clearer and sharper over a wider area, have a wider field of view, and have precise separation adjustment, making them suitable for essentially everyone's eyes. These pancake lenses also enable Quest 3 to be thinner, which makes the headset feel slightly less heavy. Best Buy is offering a $75 gift card and 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with Quest 3 purchases. You could, for example, use the Best Buy gift card to get a rigid strap and softer facial interface – upgrades which can make the headset feel more comfortable to wear. During the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. And you still get the 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. If you're a Costco member, you can get Quest 3S for $200, and if you're not, you can get it for $215. That's $85-$100 off the regular price. In both cases, Costco's deal comes with 12 months of Horizon+, compared to the 3 months you normally get with a new Meta headset. Horizon+ includes a Games Catalog with some of Quest's best VR games, including Asgard's Wrath 2, Cubism, Demeo, Dungeons of Eternity, Eleven Table Tennis, Ghosts of Tabor, Job Simulator, Maestro, Onward, Pistol Whip, Red Matter, Synth Riders, The Climb 2, and Walkabout Mini Golf. It also lets subscribers redeem 2 monthly games pre-selected by Meta. The Costco deal lasts through December 2, the coming Tuesday, so make sure to grab it soon if you want to affordably bring a friend or relative into VR. Quest 3S is $250 at Best Buy, and the retailer is offering a $50 Best Buy gift card, 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners VR game. That's a $50 discount from the headset's regular $300 price, and the three perks together are worth $110. You can find the deal for the 128GB base model of Quest 3S here. A similar offer is available for the 256GB storage model, with a $330 price ($70 off) and the same perks. You still get 3 months of the Meta Horizon+ subscription, as with all purchases of new Meta headsets. You could use the $50 Best Buy gift card to get the Elite Strap to make the headset more comfortable for just $20, for example, while during the 1 month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate (normally $30) you can play popular flatscreen games like Call of Duty on a giant virtual screen. As for The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, it's also normally $30, and it's widely considered to be one of the best VR games of all time due to its physics-based combat system, earning an 'Essential' score in our review. PlayStation VR2 is $300 at all official retailers until December 19, its lowest price ever. PlayStation VR2 is not a standalone headset, and it has a cable which needs to be connected to a host device. It connects to the PS5 or PS5 Pro console out of the box, and can alternatively connect to a gaming PC with the sold-separately PC adapter. This price applies to both the regular SKU and the bundle with Horizon Call of the Mountain, so you should always grab the latter if it's in stock. At this discounted price, PlayStation VR2 is an ideal option for a PS5 owner heavily invested in the PlayStation ecosystem, or, with the adapter, a PC owner interested in sim racing, flight sim, or other seated games. The PS VR2 discount is available for another three weeks, so there should be plenty of time to grab one in time for Christmas. Pico 4 Ultra is a Quest 3 competitor from ByteDance, the Chinese tech giant behind TikTok. It isn't sold in North America, so if you're in the US or Canada you can ignore its existence. For those who are in a region where Pico 4 Ultra is sold, the Black Friday 2025 deal prices it at €400, and comes with 2 VR games and a season pass for Premier League Player. Those 2 VR games are Pistol Whip and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad, widely considered to be among the best VR games of all time. The headset is normally priced at €600, so this is a massive €200 discount. And the 2 VR games and season pass are worth €100 together, meaning the total extra value here is €300. Pico 4 Ultra holds up relatively well to Quest 3, but while the Pico Store has a decent chunk of the content available on Quest 3, it still lacks many of the games you'll find on Meta's platform, particularly the blockbuster exclusives. However, ByteDance has a unique offering which Meta has ruled out making an equivalent of: Pico Motion Trackers. They're lightweight wireless pucks that you can strap to yourself to add various levels of body tracking in supported titles. For Black Friday get a pair for €70 to strap to your ankles to add leg tracking. Then, you can add the 'Waist Version' for €40 to improve the quality of body tracking and get a true orientation for your waist. And if you want to go even further, you can now get a second €70 pair for your upper leg or forearms, improving leg or arm tracking, for a total of 5 trackers. Supported titles for Pico Motion Trackers include VRChat (both standalone and via wireless PC VR) and Blade & Sorcery: Nomad. Get a weekly summary of the most important VR and AR news.

Title: Snapchat is nearing 1 billion monthly users. Why can’t it turn a profit?
URL: https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/11/28/snapchat-profit/
Time Published: 2025-11-28T20:54:43Z

By Queenie Wong, Los Angeles Times Snapchat, an app whose disappearing messages and silly face filters made chatting with loved ones more casual, is close to a milestone that few social media platforms achieve: reaching 1 billion monthly users. But Snap, the Santa Monica company behind the app, faces a crucial test. The 14-year-old tech company is still losing money and has seen its share price tumble as it barrels forward to popularize augmented reality glasses next year. And even though more people in developing countries are using the app, Snapchat usage in markets where the company makes more revenue per user, including the United States and Europe, has dropped. Snapchat has 943 million monthly active users globally, according to the company. Growth in India, where TikTok is banned, and Pakistan have fueled Snapchat’s global user growth, data from market intelligence firm Sensor Tower show. In India, Snapchat monthly users have surpassed 250 million, making up more than a quarter of its user base, according to numbers Snap released in July. At the same time, in the third quarter, Snapchat monthly active users declined by 4% in the U.S. and double digits in France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom, Sensor Tower said. Snap Chief Executive Evan Spiegel wrote in a September note to employees the company is in a “crucible moment,” comparing it to a “middle child” wedged between larger tech giants and smaller rivals. “This moment isn’t just about survival,” Spiegel wrote in the note. “It’s about proving that a different way of building technology, one that deepens friendships and inspires creativity, can succeed in a world that often rewards the opposite.” The 35-year-old tech executive co-founded Snapchat — initially known as Picaboo — in 2011 with friends as part of a class project while attending Stanford University. Back then, texts and photos posted on social media such as Facebook and Instagram were more permanent. Snapchat’s logo is a ghost and the app distinguished itself from its competitors by giving people a way to share photos and messages that disappeared once someone viewed it. Instead of a social media app that opens to a feed of content, Snapchat opens to a camera. Rather than worry about whether they looked perfect, people leaned into quirky and creative ways to express themselves. They overlaid effects onto their selfies, transforming their faces into cute dogs and even puking rainbows. The app encouraged people to keep sending these disappearing messages known as “Snaps” to their loved ones at least once a day, keeping what’s known as a “streak” alive. As Snapchat’s popularity soared, fueling the rise of vertical videos, bigger social media rivals took notice. Snapchat’s co-founders turned down Facebook’s multibillion-dollar offer to buy the company. Facebook and its photo-sharing app Instagram copied Snapchat’s signature features including Stories, which allowed people to post images and videos that vanish after 24 hours. This prompted some Snapchat users to flock to its rival Instagram. Spiegel jokingly titled himself as the vice president of product at Meta, Facebook’s parent company, on LinkedIn, a nod to the social media giant’s cloning of Snapchat’s features. Although Snapchat set itself apart from other social media, it also faced similar concerns tech platforms grappled with such as child safety and mental health. The app is popular among teenagers, prompting some users to question if they’re too old for Snapchat and should leave. Investor confidence in the company has plummeted. In 2021, Snap’s stock peaked at more than $83 per share. Snap’s share price closed Tuesday at $7.64. Competing with larger rivals such as Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and TikTok, for ad dollars has been challenging for Snapchat and it has struggled to consistently turn a profit. Apple’s privacy feature made it tougher for advertisers to track users across apps and websites, posing an extra hurdle for social networks. Research firm eMarketer estimates that in 2025 Snapchat will claim 2.1% of U.S. social network ad spending, but said that share is dropping. Snapchat’s initial focus on disappearing messages made it tougher for the company to rope in advertisers because people typically don’t want to see ads in the middle of a private conversation. But the company has been updating its ad tools and expanded the places where ads are shown, including between short videos. Although Snapchat is popular among Gen Z and millennials, its audience might limit what businesses want to advertise on its platform. “It definitely skews a lot younger and that naturally sort of limits advertiser interests in its audience,” said Max Willens, a senior analyst at eMarketer. If a business wants to advertise retirement planning, for example, they would probably go to Facebook instead of Snapchat. On Snapchat, advertisers have also used augmented reality effects to promote their brands in quirky ways to a young audience. Snapchat users can transform themselves into a dancing McDonald’s McRib sandwich or snap selfies with digital animals from the Disney film “Zootopia 2.” Snap has been looking at other ways to make money. The company offers subscription plans so users can customize the app’s wallpaper, personalize their digital avatars known as Bitmojis and see how often their friends view their content. It started to limit the amount of free storage it offers to 5 gigabytes. AI company Perplexity said it will pay Snap $400 million over one year so users can find answers from its “AI-powered answer engine.” In the third quarter, Snap revenue reached $1.5 billion, up 10% compared with the same period last year. The company narrowed its net loss to $104 million, versus a net loss of $153 million during the year-earlier period. This month, JP Morgan analysts raised Snap’s price target to $8 after the Perplexity deal but kept an underweight rating on the shares, meaning they expect the stock to underperform. The firm said Snap has “a sizable market opportunity, an engaged user base, and a solid track record of innovation” but it’s also looking for “more consistent execution, improved user & revenue trends, & greater profitability.” Snap has made bold and expensive bets on the future of computing by releasing a drone and glasses to capture photos and videos — though those products flopped. Now Snap plans to release augmented reality glasses in 2026 that let people interact with digital images overlaid onto the physical world. Instead of taking out your phone, people will be able to review documents, stream movies, play chess and more through glasses. For now, analysts say it’s too early to tell if Snap’s bets will pay off or the company will end up in the social media graveyard like Myspace or Vine. “There’s nothing written down that says you just get to be around forever if you’re a social media platform,” Willens said. “Although almost all of those still kind of trudge along in some state or another.” ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Title: The best Black Friday PC hardware deals: Graphics cards, SSDs, and accessories are down to record-low prices

Time Published: 2025-11-28T19:37:42Z

It's Black Friday, and some of the top discounts you'll find are on PC hardware. As one of Business Insider Reviews' computing experts, I can tell you that if you've been waiting to upgrade your PC setup, now's the time, as manufacturers try to clear out all of their 2025 stock ahead of the new year. That means excellent Black Friday discounts on graphics cards, solid-state drives, monitors, and more. Some of the best Black Friday computer hardware deals I've found so far include $90 off a new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU from Asus, a 25% discount on a Nintendo Switch 2-compatible microSD Express card, and a Dell 4K monitor for an all-time low price of $200. I expect deals to come and go as the weekend progresses, so check back here often for updates. And if you're in the market for more than PC hardware, check out our main Black Friday deals page to find sales across tech, style, home, kitchen, and more. The extreme GPU shortage of the early 2020s is largely over, but graphics cards still command a high price. Luckily, GPUs tend to see big discounts on Black Friday. If you're building a new PC or upgrading an old one, consider investing in a new graphics card while these discounts are available. The GeForce RTX 5070 is one of Nvidia's newest graphics cards, offering sufficient power to maintain high framerates in even the most intensive games. This model from Asus uses its popular TUF components, which are built to withstand bumps, scratches, and heat. The RTX 5060 is Nvidia's entry-level card, but don't be fooled — any card in the RTX 50-series line is strong enough to ensure high-quality graphics in nearly any game. The "3X" in this model's name refers to its three built-in fans, which help keep the system cool while you're playing. AMD graphics cards aren't as popular as their Nvidia counterparts, but they're still a great choice for any gamer who wants a powerful (and affordable) GPU. This model comes from Sapphire, a manufacturer that specializes in AMD hardware. Solid-state drives come in three varieties: External, SATA, and NVMe. External drives, as the name implies, sit outside your computer and are portable, which is great for moving files from one system to another. SATA and NVMe drives, however, are installed inside your PC. They're both built for the same purpose, but NVMe drives are smaller and faster. Right now, I'm seeing good deals on External and NVMe SSDs, but not many on SATA options. Western Digital is a titan in the digital storage market, and this WD_Black SSD stick shows why. With a top read speed of nearly 15GB per second, it may be the fastest SSD on the market right now. This drive from Crucial offers ample storage and fast read speeds at a budget-friendly price. It's also compatible with a wide variety of gaming devices, including the PlayStation 5 and ROG Ally X. Advances in digital storage technology have made microSD cards more affordable than ever. That said, Black Friday is a great time to save even more on these tiny storage solutions — especially if you're a Nintendo Switch 2 owner who still needs to buy a new microSD Express card. Big things come in small packages — like this microSD card from Samsung, which comes with a whopping terabyte of storage. That's more space than most computers come equipped with, and it's enough to store thousands of photos. MicroSD Express is the newest standard for microSD cards, and it's also the only type of card that the Nintendo Switch 2 accepts. If you're looking for more space to store your games and screenshots, this 512GB Express card from Samsung is a great choice. It always seems like you run out of USB ports the moment you need them most. Luckily, it doesn't take much work to add more. All you need is a USB-C hub, which turns a single USB-C port on your computer into multiple USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, and Ethernet connections. And this Black Friday, I'm finding deals on hubs from every major brand. This USB-C hub from Baseus doesn't just look advanced — it also supports a wider range of devices than nearly any other hub on the market. This includes an Ethernet port, slots for both microSD and SD cards, two HDMI ports, and a wealth of USB ports. Anker has a hub for pretty much any situation. This model, which features HDMI, SD card, Ethernet, and USB ports, offers fast transfer speeds and weighs less than half a pound. UGreen has a lot of clout in the tech accessory world, and this 6-in-1 hub comes highly recommended. It offers HDMI and USB ports, along with fast charging speeds, for a budget price. Sometimes you don't need every type of port under the sun — especially if most of your devices use the same sort of plug. This Belkin hub features four USB-C ports with fast transfer speeds, perfect for Apple aficionados. When most people think of a keyboard and mouse, they probably picture a generic gray slab and blob. Nothing that's worth getting excited about. But modern mouse and keyboard combos are much more than that. I'm finding deals on mechanical keyboards, gaming mice, and even a status symbol among true typing maniacs: a split ergonomic keyboard. Mechanical keyboards, which offer a more tactile response than typical membrane boards, are all the rage these days. This model from Keychron is a great entry-level keyboard, offering clicky keys and a full number pad for a more affordable price than most mechanical boards. Corsair has a reputation for products that are both flashy and functional. This mechanical keyboard lets you give each key its own lighting, transmits inputs at lightning speed, and comes with a detachable soft palm rest. Split keyboards have been around for decades with proven health benefits, but it's only recently that they've really started to come into vogue. This critically acclaimed model can be placed up to 9" apart, laid flat or angled, and includes soft palm rests for extra comfort. Sometimes simpler is better, and this keyboard and mouse bundle from Amazon Basics is about as simple (and affordable) as you can get. The keyboard features full number and media control keys along the top row, and the mouse scrolls and swipes smoothly. You can have the strongest PC in the world, but it doesn't mean much if you don't have a great monitor to match. After all, no game is worth playing, and no movie is worth watching on a dull screen. Black Friday is one of the best times to score a deal on new monitors, and I've found discounts on monitors across a wide range of sizes and types. Curved monitors look cool, but finding a quality product tends to drain your wallet. The exception is this model from Sceptre, which offers nearly 25 inches of HD real estate. Combine that with the fast 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, and you have a top-tier pick for any gaming setup, regardless of budget. 4K monitors aren't rare, but it's not easy to find one at this price. This 27-inch model from Dell features a wide color gamut and fast refresh rates — perfect for graphic design, gaming, and everything in between. You don't need a desktop PC to install a second monitor. This portable monitor is plug-and-play, meaning once you connect it to your laptop or console via USB-C or Mini HDMI, it'll start working right away. And once it's active, it'll dazzle with a high refresh rate and wide color range. Yes, Black Friday and its sister shopping holiday, Cyber Monday, are among the best times of year to buy computer products. Computers and PC accessories tend to drop to exceptionally low prices on Black Friday. This is especially true for products that receive new iterations every so often, like laptops and graphics cards, since manufacturers attempt to clear out their stock ahead of these new releases. It depends on what sort of product you're using, but generally, most accessories will work on both operating systems. Monitors, computer mice, and USB hubs are especially universal. Keyboards are a bit more complicated. Macs and PCs have slightly different keyboard layouts, so they usually require differently labeled boards. Luckily, keyboards with removable keys — such as mechanical boards — usually come with keycaps that match both operating systems, along with a switch to toggle between them. Graphics cards are a completely different story. Macs come with their own custom graphics cards, built directly into the central processor, and they can't be replaced or upgraded. So if you want to use an Nvidia RTX or AMD Radeon card, you'll need a PC, preferably a desktop. PC laptops also come with their own special GPUs. Branding doesn't always make sense. When it comes to PC hardware and accessories, "gaming" often tends to be a shorthand for "high quality." "Gaming" mice have more customization options; "gaming" keyboards feel better to type on; "gaming" monitors have more vivid colors and faster response times. Every graphics card is marketed primarily for gaming, even though graphic designers, animators, AI programmers, and other professionals also need them for their work. Why is this? There are probably a few reasons: First, that gamers have a reputation (deserved or not) for being tech-savvy, and thus more demanding of the products they buy; second, that PC gaming is already a high-cost hobby, and anyone willing to drop big bucks on a gaming PC can probably afford a high-quality setup to go with it; and third, to entice impressionable kids and teens who think that a product marketed for "gaming" is cooler than one marketed for checking email. All this is to say that products with "gaming" in the name aren't exclusively for gamers. A good gaming PC is also a good everyday PC, and this philosophy extends to accessories as well.

Google and Meta are creating new AI chips, adding competition. Some investors, like Michael Burry, are cautious about Nvidia’s price. Despite this, Nvidia’s earnings and cash flow remain strong.

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang allegedly asks managers discouraging AI use: ‘Are you insane?’ — assures employees their jobs aren’t at risk because of AI

The Nvidia chief reportedly made the statement during an all-hands meeting after its record quarterly earnings. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia chief executive Jensen Huang was allegedly recorded telling his people to use more AI while assuring them that they won’t get replaced by the tool. The head of the AI chip giant is reported to have said this during an all-hands meeting after its record-breaking quarter, which was leaked to Business Insider. The statements were reportedly made during the same meeting where he complained about the drop in Nvidia’s stock price despite performing absolutely well, with Huang saying that the market did not appreciate the company’s ‘incredible’ quarter. “My understanding is Nvidia has some managers who are telling their people to use less AI. Are you insane?” Huang reportedly said in the recording. “I want every task that is possible to be automated with artificial intelligence to be automated with artificial intelligence. I promise you; you will have work to do.” This push to use more AI tools has been happening across the industry, especially among massive tech companies like Meta and Microsoft. These two giants have been mandating their employees to use AI, with the use of such tools becoming a part of their evaluation. Business Insider also reports that Google has instructed its engineers to use AI for coding, while Amazon employees have requested the company to adopt AI coding tool Cursor. On the other hand, the widespread adoption of AI has made most employees wary of being replaced by machines. Even experts and industry leaders have been warning about this trend: Ford CEO Jim Farley said that it could wipe out half of white-collar jobs in the U.S., while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that it could cause up to 20% unemployment in the next half-decade. A Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Oak Ridge National Laboratory study even created a labor simulation tool that estimates that up to 11.7% of workers are in danger of being replaced by AI. Nevertheless, Jensen Huang has reportedly reassured his employees that they are not in danger of being supplanted by this technology. Despite implementing the use of AI tools, Nvidia has continuously been hiring people, bringing in over 6,000 new faces in its last fiscal year. And amid the increasing tech industry layoffs, Huang says that the company probably needs about 10,000 more staff members. It makes sense for Huang and Nvidia to push their people into using AI. After all, it’s the reason that the once-gaming GPU maker has become the first company in the world to hit a $5-trillion market capitalization. But it’s just a tool that can enhance the productivity of employees, not something that should replace them entirely.

Of course, not all deals are created equal–some “special” offers are simply marketing–but many discounts are actually quite good this year! That’s where this post comes into play–separating the cream of the crop from the marketing fluff to bring you the best deals related to Disney and travel! In this post, I’ve aggregated the best deals–some of which are Disney-specific, whereas others are non-Disney items. This includes a lot of fun items for collectors, parents, people doing gift shopping, plus things that will be useful for Walt Disney World or Disneyland vacations… If you want a broader selection of the current deals, check out Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page for the biggest savings and most popular deals. Even then, the options can be overwhelming, as there are literally tens of thousands of items on sale. If you’re not already a member, click here for a FREE 30-day Amazon Prime trial membership. For this list, we’ve combed through the various deals on Amazon’s Black Friday Sale page and are sharing only those we deem good. We receive a small commission from Amazon for your purchases, so buying through these links helps support the site. However, neither the price you pay nor our recommendations (or lack thereof) are impacted by that. Many things on sale for Black Friday are also on our Christmas Gift Guide for Disney Fans or our Ultimate Walt Disney World Packing List, so double win! Even without special offers, those are great ways to get your holiday shopping started–or create your own Christmas list. On with the list of the Best Amazon Black Friday Sale deals for 2025, first with the top picks followed by various categories… Bose QuietComfort Wireless Headphones — At 43% off and “selling fast” according to Amazon, this is one of the hottest deals of Black Friday. Sarah has owned two pairs of Bose QuietComfort headphones, which should speak volumes about what she thinks of them. They are spectacular, worth every penny, and way better than Beats or Sony headphones. The noise cancelling is perfect for flights, public transit, or just trying to work and maintain focus. The only downside is the large size. Fire 8 Kids Tablet – Even if you strive to be screen-free, this can be a lifesaver on flights or in other meltdown scenarios. This tablet for kids has parental controls, goal-setting, time limits, plus 1 FREE year of Amazon Kids+ with access to tons of educational content from PBS Kids, Nickelodeon, Disney, and more. This tablet is 54% off–plenty of others are 50% to 55% off as part of the up to 60% off Amazon devices deal (Ring cameras, Kindle readers, Echos, Fires, etc). Travel White Noise Machine – We actually bought this for traveling with our baby as it was recommended by countless parenting blogs. As it turns out, this is just great for traveling in general. That’s doubly true at Walt Disney World, where I swear that even Deluxe Resorts have paper-thin walls. Save 50%+ on Crocs – This is one of the best deals on Crocs we’ve seen in a while, and it’s on a wide variety of styles–including some non-hideous ones! Great for wearing around the house or garden, or Disney, I guess, if you think this looks good. Be sure to check for the “save 10% with brand promotion” deal sweetener on a couple of Crocs. Stokke YOYO3 Stroller – This is the Cadillac of strollers…or would be if Cadillacs were known as lightweight and nimble travel vehicles. This stroller is worth every penny, with great handling and ease of use. Most importantly, it’s incredibly light, easy to use, and folds down incredibly compact–small enough to fit in an overhead bin. We’ve tried a lot of strollers, but this is the only one we love that is perfect for travel to Walt Disney World and beyond. 20% off may not seem great, but this stroller only goes on sale once per year–on Black Friday. This is the cheapest you’ll ever see it. Playstation 5 Console – Take $100 off the Playstation 5, including various bundles (can’t go wrong with the Ghost of Yotei option). Most Disney-aged kids are going to be much better suited by the Nintendo Switch 2, but this is a great deal on the PS5, and older fans (like…my age) might favor the horsepower here. Philips GoZero Insulated Water Bottle — This insulated metal GoZero bottle by Philips has great reviews–it’s durable, BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and uses a 2-stage activated carbon filter reduces odor, chlorine and leaves zero aftertaste. 36% off for Black Friday, albeit as a Lightning Deal (so might be dead by the time you see this). Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers – This one ended up on my “for you” Black Friday deals page, which I thought was amusing given what I wrote in Disney Wants to ‘Break Spell’ of Guests Glued to Phones in Parks. Guess Big Tech isn’t always listening…or they just think I must want this because I’ve been researching it a lot. (Either way, not an actual recommendation–even if it is supposedly a popular deal.) LEGO Disney Cruella De Vil’s Car – detailed buildable replica of Cruella’s infamous car is packed with authentic features, including opening doors, a removable roof for expanded play access, and steering using the spare wheel at the back of the vehicle. This is 30% off for Black Friday, and according to Amazon it is “selling fast.” LEGO Star Wars: The Phantom Menace Battle Droid – Honestly had no idea they were still making new Phantom Menace toys (or is it a nostalgia play?). Perhaps that’s why this is on sale for 36% off, but that wouldn’t explain the “selling fast” part of the deal. LEGO Disney Frozen Advent Calendar (2025) – At 47% off, this is a scorching hot deal–the kind that will sell out via Amazon, and only be available from third party sellers for double the cost. Megatron is already a huge Frozen fan, but she’s still too young for this, so it’ll be something we hold for a couple of years. LEGO Disney Frozen Elsa’s Ice Palace – This buildable Disney Frozen toy features a 3-level ice palace with a tower, Elsa, Anna and Kristoff LEGO Disney mini-doll figures and an Olaf snowman figure. This is a stellar deal at 44% off–don’t wait for Black Friday on this one! LEGO Disney and Pixar ‘Up’ House – This 598-piece LEGO Disney toy set includes a partial house built with balloons, different rooms and functions, plus Carl Fredricksen and Russell LEGO minifigures, and a Dug LEGO dog figure for dog lovers. Good deal at 37% off. Lenox 2025 Disney Christmas Ornaments – There are several Lenox Christmas ornaments (and other decor) on sale for Black Friday, from this Mickey Mouse to Cinderella Castle! Hallmark Elsa Ornament – This doesn’t strike me as the normal Hallmark style, but it’s a cute ornament and looks reasonably high quality. Good deal. Thomas Kinkade Candy Cane Express Christmas Puzzle – It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but we love the Kinkade art style. It’s warm and cozy, even a bit schmaltzy. Comforting like a Hallmark movie, a good sweater, or a cup of coffee by the fireplace. Thomas Kinkade Disney Dreams 2026 Wall Calendar – This calendar is a must-buy every single year, and that’s doubly true for 2026 with Frozen cover art and it being 38% off for Black Friday! Moana 2 BD+DVD+Digital Combo – Is physical media making a comeback now that streaming keeps raising its prices? If so, this set at 60% off is a great deal! Get 3 for the Price of 2 – This is a deal Amazon does each year for Black Friday and Cyber Monday, with rotating products. Here’s how to take advantage: Here are our top recommendations for the 3 for 2 deal in order to maximize savings: These are all great options because every single one is an excellent book (or set of books) that’s a must-own for Disney fans. They’re also all on sale by significant amounts even before the 3 for 2 deal. Finally, they’re all priced around $30, which allows you to maximize your savings. (You don’t want to pick two ~$30 books and a $12 one, because the last one is the free one!) The Unofficial Disney Parks Cookbooks Box Set – Don’t let “unofficial” fool you. While not made by Disney, these are the definitive cookbooks from the parks and are fan-favorites. 54% off. I’m also seeing a promo to “Save $22.08 on 3 select items.” I can’t figure out how to tell which items are eligible, and this might be targeted, but I plan on adding a bunch of stuff to my cart later today and seeing what happens. Wish me luck. The Unofficial Disney Parks Holiday Cookbooks – Same idea here, but with holiday foods! Get it now for 56% off. Maps of the Disney Parks — This is a staple of our gift-giving guides, and that’s in part because it looks really nice, making it an eye-catching gift. This also has a “Save $21.03 on 3 select items” notice. Interestingly, the amounts are different between the products. Sukeen Cooling Towel 4-Pack – The cooling system on these towels uses moisture from the towel to draw the sweat away from your skin to keep you cool. We still prefer the Frogg Toggs Chilly Pad, but some Walt Disney World fans favor these. You can probably wait out this deal; these things are always on sale. JoyJolt Disney Mickey Mouse 3D Glass Cups Set of 2 – JoyJolt Disney coffee cups aren’t your regular double walled glasses. Look inside and you’ll discover Disney’s Mickey Mouse inside your coffee in optical 3D. Great deal at 40%! Mickey Pants and Minnie Skirt 3D Double Wall Glass Coffee Cups – Same story here with these coffee cups. Note that you can toggle between two sizes here, too. Only the smaller size is a great deal. (Another larger option is the JoyJolt Mickey & Pluto Sketch Art Mugs, also on sale for 20% off.) Simple Modern Disney Kids Tumbler – Two of Megatron’s biggest obsessions are cups and Minnie/Mickey Mouse. And of course, she wants huge cups–not kid-sized ones–because that’s what mom and dad use! Predictably, things go terribly wrong when we let her use our Tervises. This spill-proof 24 ounce stainless steel tumbler looks like a great alternative…and this type of cup is all the rage now, right? Corkcicle x Disney Minnie Mouse Tumbler – You should recognize the Corkcicle name from their partnership with Walt Disney World and sponsoring of many EPCOT events. At 30% off for a larger and nicer-looking cup, this seems like a better deal than the previous entry. Serenity Kids Baby Food Pouches – Several readers have asked what Megatron eats in the parks. By and large, this is the answer. On sale for Black Friday. Cerebelly Baby Food Pouches – And this, which is also on sale for Black Friday. FuelRod 2-Pack – Did you ever think you’d see the day when Disney Tourist Blog dot com was actively endorsing this controversial charger? Well, we just did. An exceptional deal was involved that helped make up our minds in favor of the new and improved device. There’s actually a FuelRod 3-Pack on sale that’s an even better deal on a per unit basis–it just comes down to whether you need three of them (I’d say that’s the smart move for families, but solo travelers or couples should be fine with two.) FuelRod MAX10 – The newest swappable device is not a rod at all, but rather, a brick. This is their biggest and fastest charger, and a great deal after clipping the coupon on the product page. FuelRod – This is the weakest deal on a per unit basis, but it might make sense to get your feet wet with just one FuelRod before buying multiples. Not what we recommend, but still a solid deal! 25% Off Amazon Warehouse Deals/Resale – Not a specific deal, but rather, up to 25% off one Amazon Resale purchase (exact savings varies by category). We buy a lot of stuff this way, as what’s meant by resale is actually returns. This was actually a better deal last week when early Black Friday sales started. It was 30% off then, had more item eligibility, and there was greater selection–a lot sold out during that deal. Still, 25% off is better than nothing, and some items have been restocked. Anker Zolo 10,000mAh 30W Portable Charger with Built-in USB-C Cable for Travel – This charger is–without a doubt–the charger we’d buy if we had phones with a USB-C connector instead of the Lightning connector. This one is 23% off for Black Friday Week. Also available in 20k capacity. Anker 24,000mAh Power Bank 3-Port Portable Charger with 140W Output – For those who really go hard playing the Lightning Lane refresh game. An okay deal at 32% off, but don’t be surprised if it’s cheaper on Cyber Monday. There’s also the newer version that’s 35% off and supposedly “selling fast.” Anker 3-Port 140W Charging Block – This is a niche product, but it’s another game-changer for me. This Anker 3-port block charges my Nikon mirrorless camera, laptop, and phone simultaneously and the device is smaller than my Macbook charger by itself. I just upgraded to this during Prime Day from the prior generation–I’ve been very happy with both. Great deal at 40% off! Anker 47W Nano 3 USB-C Charger – This is what Sarah uses, and it’s absolutely perfect for her–or the average person. It’ll charge your devices faster than the standard charger (and lightyears quicker than in-wall ports at WDW hotels), and it’s 40% off for Black Friday. I believe this is the cheapest it’s ever been. Anker PowerPort Cube Strip with 3 Outlets and 3 USB Ports – Disney has refurbished many of its rooms, adding USB ports in the process, but many of them don’t work–or don’t work well. Plus, this has fast-charging to get devices recharged quicker and USB-C. There are a ton of other Anker products on sale as part of the Black Friday deals, but that’s usually the case with sales like this. One new-to-me sale is this Anker Portable Generator, which isn’t even a product that I realized they made. Obviously not for Disney (unless you’re a Fort Wilderness camper!), but intriguing at 56% off! Gonex Compression Packing Cubes – They key here is that these are compression packing cubes, which normally cost more and will save you even more space when packing. If you need the suitcase space, we recommend this set over the one below. Be sure to clip the coupon for more off. Gonex Packable Backpack — Another excellent innovation from the fine folks at Gonex…a brand I’ve literally never heard of outside the ‘packable’ space. This takes up minimal room in your suitcase and more importantly is super lightweight. That minimizes the amount of back-sweat you’ll have to endure from the Florida heat and humidity. Be sure to clip the coupon–that’s the only way this is a deal. Gonex Packable Duffel Bag – I swear this post isn’t sponsored by Gonex. It just happens that we have a lot of their products because they’re often deeply discounted on Amazon’s various deal days. In this case, we use the packable duffel whenever traveling internationally to bring home everything we buy. And not just Disney stuff. Thanks to the strength of the dollar, we stock up on everything. During a recent trip to Japan, we went antiquing and thrifting, and I also dropped a ridiculous amount at UNIQLO. On the plus side, I won’t have to buy socks or undershirts for the next few years! Personal Neck Fan – We bought this little device a couple years ago, and it’s shockingly effective. It’s like that refreshing feeling you get when walking past an open doorway of an air-conditioned building. It’s not perfect, but it’s a really fantastic idea, and is a breath of fresh air during hot and humid days in Florida (which is ~10 months of the year). Handheld Portable Small Fan (USB Chargeable) – If you don’t want to be quite as dorky with the neck fan and don’t want to wear a cooling towel, this classic handheld fan is the more traditional option for keeping cool. It ends up being under $10 after discount and clipping the coupon on the product page. Packing Cube Sets (Multiple Sizes) – Another staple of our packing list, we are fans of packing cubes and these are a solid deal. (With that said, there are a LOT of packing cubes on sale, so you might want to browse the results for “packing cubes” on the Amazon Black Friday page and see which sizes/colors/etc. best suit you.) Loungefly Pumpking Minnie Mouse Backpack – This is one of several Loungefly backpacks that’s 50% off. A cute bag at a great price, so long as you don’t mind holding onto it for ~9 months. Loungefly Organizer – I can’t imagine why you’d want to reduce the amount of usable space in your already small backpack, but I’m told this is very popular. And on sale for Black Friday. Knockoff Loungefly Bag – Calling a spade a spade, this is basically a bootleg Loungefly bag. Now, I am definitely NOT the target audience for such a product, but as someone who doesn’t “get” how on earth Loungeflys are so expensive, I think this is a far, far superior option! More Loungefly Black Friday Deals – Lots of other Loungefly products on sale, including several more Disney items…some of which are kinda ugly TBH. 12 Beloved Disney Classic Little Golden Books (Boxed Set) – This is one of two Disney Little Golden Book box sets that are on sale for deep discounts. This is truly classics, with one-dozen Walt Disney Little Golden Books originally published in the 1950s and 1960s. This one is 62% off, making each title $2.25! Ultimate Princess Boxed Set of 12 Little Golden Books – This is 47% off! 3 for 2 Little Golden Books – There are actually a ton more options as part of that sale–here’s a full rundown of titles. Bedtime Favorites Storybook Collection – With 18 stories and 250 illustrations, this is a great option for bedtime reading to little ones. Disney Princess Cookbook – From Rapunzel’s Frying Pan Eggs to Ariel’s Sea Turtle Cupcakes, this beautiful cookbook is filled with delicious recipes inspired by the Princesses’ many adventures. Disney Storybook Collection — A large, 300+ page hardcover book retelling several classic Disney stories complete with 250 pieces of artwork from the Disney Archives. Walt Disney’s Disneyland — One of my favorite Disneyland books of all-time at a crazy-good price. Anyone who has owned or even held a TASCHEN book knows why this is something special. This is an incredibly high-quality coffee table book, and well worth more than price. Holiday Magic at the Disney Parks: Celebrations Around the World — This is an incredible deep dive into the holidays (mostly Christmas and Halloween, but also Easter and other seasonal events) with great photos, detailed information, and rich history. If you love the seasonal events, this is an absolute must-own. Poster Art of the Disney Parks, Second Edition – This new title is an expanded and updated edition of the beloved book that ranks highly in our library. The second edition renders the first obsolete, as the 85+ new posters and behind-the-scenes development info nearly doubles the book in length. It’s worth it for all of the awesome new posters made for EPCOT’s reimagining alone. Okay, that’s it for right now. There are a bunch of other great deals that are irrelevant to Disney and travel (but also don’t appeal to me) on the Amazon Black Friday Sale homepage. We recommend browsing for yourself a bit, and checking back often, as new deals are regularly appearing–and disappearing. Just be mindful of the fact that some of these offers are time-sensitive, so you don’t want to spend too much time procrastinating and end up losing out! Be sure to check back here throughout the coming days, as I’ll share new discounts and more Lightning Deals as they become available.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Now Reading Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals Welcome to WIRED’s guide to the best Cyber Monday tech deals, where we can promise you two things: these devices are worth buying (we’ve tested and recommended every one of them), and these are actual discounts (not the year-round price). So, whether you need an upgrade, want to treat yourself, or are seeking a great gift, we have you covered. Want a wider range of deals? Check out the Absolute Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup to find more bargains. Updated December 1: We've added deals on a Nest Doorbell, Eufy robot vacuum, TP-Link security camera, LG OLED TV, Ceptics travel adapter, Google Pixel Watch 4, Sony surround sound system, and Viture smart glasses. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Google Pixel 10 is one of the best Android phones you can buy. Easy to recommend at full price, the Pixel 10 is an absolute bargain with this discount. You get an excellent triple-camera system with a 5X optical zoom sensor, support for Qi2 wireless charging, so you can magnetically attach to wireless chargers and docks, and Google’s super smart software features (Call Screen to filter out spam calls is our favorite). Learn more in the Best Pixel Phones guide. Sony Amazon Walmart Best Buy Target The PlayStation 5 Pro is $100 off right now, and it's the way to play all the best PS5 games with the graphics cranked up to their maximum quality. Sony's console comes with one controller, but since Sony's Dual Sense Controller ($55) is also on sale right now, I'd snag another one. There are discounts on quite a few PS bundles, too. Razer Razer This svelte gaming laptop has a great OLED screen, a tactile keyboard that's a joy to type and game on, and an RTX 5090 graphics card inside to run the latest titles. It even has a decent selection of ports. In short, the Razer Blade 16 is one of the best gaming laptops, according to WIRED reviewer, Luke Larsen, and this is a rare, hefty discount. Nest Amazon Walmart Google Best Buy This has been the top pick in our best video doorbells guide for a while now. While it's limited to 1080p (the new model is 2K), this is battery-powered, so it's still a great choice if you can't hard wire. Google's alerts are pretty reliable, and there are some smart features (including facial recognition) if you can stomach the subscription. Eufy Amazon The top pick in our best robot vacuums for half price is a deal worth jumping on. Free yourself from daily cleaning with this self-emptying robot vacuum that navigates well, uses AI to identify obstacles (semi-successfully), and has a mopping function. Google Amazon Best Buy Google Store The Pixel 9a is our top smartphone choice for most people, and it's now $50 cheaper than it was on Black Friday itself. At $349, you're getting a smooth-performing smartphone with a reliable dual-camera system that's unmatched at this price, not to mention day-long battery life and a completely flat camera lens system for anyone who hates giant camera bumps. Oh, and it'll get 7 years of software updates. Sony Amazon B&H Photo Adorama Sony's A7 IV is the best mirrorless camera on the market (for most people). It's a 33-megapixel, full-frame camera with a brilliant autofocus system, impressive dynamic range, and crisp images. There's an expansive range of 4K video options as well, along with customizable buttons to set up your preferences, so you don't have to always rummage through the menus. Reviewer Scott Gilbertson found the grip to be super comfortable and the camera to be light enough to endure for long periods without any back strain. —Boutayna Chokrane Soundcore by Anker Amazon Soundcore If you're shopping for open earbuds so that you can enjoy your music but still be aware of your surroundings, the Soundcore Aeroclip is the best we've tested so far. Reviewer Ryan Waniata praises the comfort, sound quality, usability, and value. The sound is wide and balanced, and the built-in controls are ideal for runs. Waniata likes to use them during outdoor activities, like hiking or biking, but he finds them especially helpful when he's cooking dinner and needs to stay alert for his newborn's cries. —Boutayna Chokrane Fitbit Amazon Best Buy Editor Adrienne So says the Fitbit Ace LTE is the first fitness tracker she's gotten her kids to use. It's a fitness tracker (designed with Fitbit's health sensors), gaming device, and location tracker. The $10/monthly subscription includes both LTE connectivity and Fitbit Arcade, which has a variety of movement-based games that get children on their feet and incentivize them to keep their watches on. They can call and text their guardians (and other approved contacts) through the Fitbit Ace app, and their location is trackable via Google Find My. —Boutayna Chokrane Belkin Amazon Best Buy Belkin After testing many, many Apple 3-in-1 wireless chargers, this is the one that claimed a permanent place on my bedside table. I love the classy mix of chrome and soft-touch black plastic and the weighted base enables you to grab your iPhone without pulling the whole charger off your nightstand. The iPhone pad also tilts and holds your iPhone vertically or horizontally, with support for StandBy mode. It can fast charge capable iPhone and Apple Watch models and charge any AirPods with a wireless charging case. The 5-foot braided cable is permanently attached and there’s a 36-watt wall charger in the box. TP-Link Amazon B&H TP-Link Compact and affordable, with an IP66 rating, this security camera can be used indoors or out, though it must be plugged in. It offers smart detection (people, pets, and vehicles), up to 2K resolution, and slightly laggy two-way audio. You can record locally on a microSD card or subscribe for cloud storage. This versatile device also has a magnetic mount and tiny dual spotlights. Philips Hue Amazon Best Buy This is a rare and tasty deal on my favorite Xmas lights. They work indoors or out, can be scheduled, and support a bunch of lovely animated effects. While I'm mentioning Philips Hue and its excellent but horribly expensive wares, you might want to check out some of its other Cyber Monday deals. My picks would be the wall washers ($316), TV lightstrip ($125), and HDMI sync box ($270). Asus Amazon Walmart Asus The Asus RT-BE58U is perhaps the ideal Wi-Fi 7 upgrade for modest homes and apartments still struggling with the crappy router their internet service provider sent, and that's why it tops our Best Wi-Fi Routers guide. It’s easy to set up and use, can cover up to 2,000 square feet, and boasts plenty of ports. As a dual-band router, it lacks the 6-GHz band, but has all the other advantages of Wi-Fi 7. There’s also support for VPN service, separate IoT or guest networks, and Ai Mesh. Satechi Best Buy Amazon Satechi B&H Photo Don't ask me why they keep taking our ports away. God forbid you should want to plug something into your laptop. Well, you can stick it to those minimalist designers with the best laptop docking station. This one doubles as a wedge to prop your laptop up and has a storage slot. Sony Amazon Walmart B&H Photo These wireless noise-canceling headphones may not be the latest release from Sony, but they are still an excellent pair of cans with a far deeper discount. The Sony WH-1000XM5 are relatively light and comfortable, producing accomplished sound in every scenario, and have great control options. LG Amazon Walmart LG Costco If you haven't made the leap to OLED TVs, you are in for a treat. Unparalleled contrast awaits, but OLEDs aren't just about inky blacks anymore, LG's top TV features glare reduction for bright rooms, deep and rich colors, and wonderful picture clarity, not to mention excellent upscaling. It's pricey, but this is a chunky discount. Roku Amazon Walmart If you want to get the latest streaming apps on an older TV, the Roku Streaming Stick Plus is for you. It’s easy to set up, works reliably, and has a handy voice remote that makes finding content easier than ever. It slots neatly behind most TVs, and Roku’s interface is nice and clear. Apple Amazon Amazon Walmart Apple Apple doesn’t really do sales, but other retailers do. This is the lowest price we’ve seen on a solid iPad the whole family can enjoy. The Apple iPad (A16, 2025) performs great for most tasks, looks pretty nice, and has a 12-megapixel camera. It is honestly all the iPad most folks need for surfing the web and streaming shows in bed. With iPadOS 26 and the new windowing apps feature, you can even comfortably do some work if you pair it with a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. Nimble Amazon (Medium) Amazon (Small) Amazon (Large) Nimble (All) Handy as they are for keeping you connected when your phone dies unexpectedly, portable chargers can be very same-y. The reason the Nimble Champ tops our Best Power Banks guide is Nimble’s focus on the environment. It’s made from 90 percent certified recycled plastic and comes in fully biodegradable packaging. It also works well, with capacities starting from 5,200 mAh, with USB-A and USB-C ports, and up to 15-watt charging. Amazon Amazon Amazon (Signature) Yes, you should read more, and Amazon’s Kindle e-readers make it easier to do exactly that. Our current favorite is the Kindle Paperwhite (12th generation). It has a sharp 7-inch display, auto-adjusting warm light, three-month battery life, snappy performance, and it’s slim and light, making it comfortable to hold. It even has integration with Overdrive for your library books and support for several languages. reMarkable Amazon (With Marker Plus and Book Folio) ReMarkable (with Marker Plus) ReMarkable (With Marker) The reMarkable 2 is one of the best digital notebooks, offering a paperlike writing experience, intuitive software, and several weeks of battery life. This is a budget model, so it lacks front light and color, but it’s still a decent device. Bundles where you choose both a marker and folio are heavily discounted right now, and they’re not often on sale, so it’s a good time to snap one up. Nomad Amazon Nomad The great thing about Nomad’s 65-watt charger is that it’s incredibly slim, with flip-out prongs, so it can slip easily into small pockets in your bag or purse. You get dual USB-C ports, and can pull 45 watts out of the left port and 20 out of the right. Or, if you’re just charging one device, the full 65 watts is enough for any phone, most tablets, and even some MacBooks or Windows laptops (though they may not charge at top speed). Anthbot Amazon Anthbot You know what I don't miss in the slightest? Mowing the lawn. A good robot mower, like this relatively affordable one from newcomer Anthbot, will do it for you, quietly. No wire required; it recharges itself, you just set a schedule and relax. OK, it sometimes leaves a verge, but the only model I've tried that doesn't is more than twice the price. Arlo Amazon Best Buy Sharp 2K video, color night vision, a wide 160-degree field of view, and clear two-way audio make the Arlo Pro 5S easy to recommend for folks seeking a security camera. You also get AI recognition for people and pets, a siren to scare intruders, and the quick-loading Arlo app. But you need Arlo Secure ($8 per month for one camera or $13 per month for unlimited cameras) for subject recognition, smart alerts, and cloud storage. The Arlo Pro 5S is our pick of the best outdoor security cameras. Oura Oura Amazon Best Buy I love my Oura Ring 4. It accurately tracks my sleep, activity, and stress levels and offers insights that I find genuinely useful. It’s also very comfortable, the app is super slick, with new features being added all the time, and it’s far less obtrusive than any other kind of tracker you could wear. The catch is a subscription, but this is still the best of the best smart rings. Backbone Amazon (USB-C) Walmart (USB-C) Best Buy (USB-C) Amazon (Lightning) It’s the thoughtful design that elevates the Backbone One above the rest of the best mobile controllers. Slot your phone into the compact cradle, with a USB-C jack for speedy connectivity, and you get satisfyingly clicky and responsive controls plus a 3.5-mm headphone port. You can also customize it for different games, or even use Backbone’s software as a one-stop gaming hub, if you’re willing to pay a subscription. Ray-Ban Amazon Ray-Ban Meta Yes, there is a new version of the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, but the good news is that the old pair is now on sale. If you can stomach Meta AI’s privacy policies, there’s a strong argument that it has won the smart glasses race already (at least, so far). The best smart glasses must be easy to wear, and these look great and help offload things from your phone, so you don’t have to dip into that pocket quite as much. Ceptics Amazon My pick of the best travel adapters will keep all of your gadgetry running wherever you travel. There's a classic slider design for the plug that covers more than 200 countries, but you also get one USB-C port, two USB-A ports, and a handy retractable USB-C cable (perfect if you're forgetful). JBL Amazon Walmart Best Buy JBL The JBL Flip 7 is the Bluetooth speaker that has it all. It's durable, it has stamina, it produces a punchy sound, and it comes in fun colors. As the best Bluetooth speaker you can buy, this deal is for real. Tonies Amazon Target Toniebox is our favorite speaker for young kids, particularly ages three through seven. It's essentially a squishy cube that plays stories and songs tied to different characters (aka Tonies). It's activated when your child places the figurine on top of the speaker. There are so many Tonies to choose from. Peppa Pig, Moana, Winnie the Pooh, the list goes on. You can also buy Creative Tonies to record your own audio. Super easy to use, and the cutesy ears double as volume controls. —Boutayna Chokrane Amazon Bookshop.org The best tech books unpack the rise and fall of the characters that invented the stuff that runs our lives. The New York Times and former Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou writes about Elizabeth Holmes, as she miserably fails to build a blood testing machine that would allegedly eliminate the need for hypodermic needles. Her company raised hundreds of millions of dollars, but its technology was inaccurate. Rather than admit defeat, she pressed on, which is why Holmes was put on trial for fraud and sentenced to 11 years in prison. —Boutayna Chokrane Google Amazon (45 mm) Amazon (41 mm) Best Buy Google Store Google's smartwatch is the perfect partner for your Pixel phone, or any Android phone. The Pixel Watch 4 is comfy, with a lovely domed design and a very bright display. It also offers accurate health and fitness tracking, impressive battery life, and fast charging. You can also snag a pair of Pixel Buds 2a pretty cheap right now as they're $99 ($30 off). Samsung Amazon (S25) Amazon (S25)+ Amazon (Ultra) Samsung (All) Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 has been heavily discounted all Cyber Weekend, probably because its successors are right around the corner (the Galaxy S26 series is expected to be announced in January). But we still love these excellent smartphones. The S25 is the smallest, the S25+ gets a few extra perks, plus a bigger screen and better battery life, and the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a dual telephoto camera system, integrated S Pen stylus, and a beefy battery. Be sure to check out the Best Samsung Phones guide for the full scoop. —Molly Higgins Samsung Amazon (Flip7) Amazon (Fold7) Samsung (Flip7) Samsung (Fold7) You're not like other girls; you have a folding phone. In all seriousness, folding phones are not as fragile as they used to be, with durability improving while remaining slim. We love the Galaxy Z Fold7 because it's amazingly slim and versatile. You can use the front screen like normal, and when you need extra real estate, open the device up. You can view apps on a much larger scale or easily split-screen two apps. If you're not feeling a folding phone, the updated Galaxy Z Flip7 has a more usable front screen. Read our Best Folding Phones guide to decide which is best for you at the discounted price this Cyber Weekend. —Molly Higgins Apple Amazon Best Buy Even though they're an older model, we like these AirPods because of their hearing aid feature, comfort, and outstanding streaming experience. If you're an iPhone user, you should have some AirPods, and we still think these are a good choice for most people because of their active noise cancellation, sound quality, and easy pairing within the Apple ecosystem. Plus, it doesn't hurt that they're nearly 25 percent off for Cyber Monday. —Molly Higgins Amazon Amazon (3-Pack) Amazon (2-Pack) Best Buy (3-Pack) We love Amazon's Eero mesh systems for being so easy to set up and use, but they also double as smart home hubs with support for Matter, Thread, and Zigbee. The Eero Pro 6E is a tri-band mesh that adds the 6-GHz band to the familiar 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz bands. For busy households with many devices and a 1 Gbps or faster connection, this mesh system is ideal. Just bear in mind that the 6-GHz band is short-range. The pricey Eero Plus subscription is an extra $10 per month or $100 per year, but adds so much value with parental controls, advanced security, ad blocking, and even a password manager and VPN service. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple We on the WIRED Reviews team still think this is the best Apple Watch for most people. With its newest upgrade, it now has the latest S10 chip, a Liquid Glass display, Workout Buddy, and wrist-flick gestures. If you have an iPhone, this accessory is a no-brainer. It makes a great gift for yourself or others, and is seriously discounted at only $200 right now. —Molly Higgins Sony Amazon B&H Up your home theater game with a surround sound system from Sony. The Bravia Theater System 6 has a classy, understated design, combining a beefy subwoofer, two tall and musical surround speakers, and a small center soundbar to envelop you in audio. It's a great way to get more from your movies. Viture Amazon Best Buy If you want a virtual screen for gaming that you can take anywhere, the Viture Luma Pro XR are my pick of the best smart glasses for gaming. These glasses can plug directly into your phone (and many other gadgets) via USB-C to give you a 152-inch screen. This bundle comes with an excellent 8BitDo controller.

Title: Google's AI Progress Drives MediaTek To Best Week Since 2002

MediaTek Inc. shares posted their best week since 2002, as artificial intelligence advances at its client Google help reshape the growth outlook for the Taiwanese chipmaker. The stock rose for a fifth-straight day Friday in Taipei, taking its weekly gain to 22%, on investor enthusiasm over Google’s latest Gemini model and AI chip deals. MediaTek has reportedly partnered with the Alphabet Inc. unit on design of tensor processing units, seen as a potential rival to Nvidia Corp. chips in AI applications. Known for its smartphone chips, MediaTek has suffered from a cloudy outlook for end-product demand as well as margin pressure due to competition and high development costs. The AI news has brought relief for the shares, which are still down 1% on the year. China business remains tough into 2026, yet “Google TPU upside should offset the smartphone headwind in the longer term,” according to Morgan Stanley analysts Charlie Chan and Daniel Yen. They upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight on Thursday. The early days of AI centered on training of large language models, which requires the massive computing power provided by graphic processing units such as those from Nvidia. The shift in focus to inference — or how LLMs respond to user queries — is putting a spotlight on application-specific integrated circuits such as TPUs. UBS Group AG analysts led by Sunny Lin raised their estimate for MediaTek’s sales contribution from TPUs in 2027 to $4 billion from $1.8 billion. The analysts see the chips accounting for 20% of the company’s operating profit by 2028, “depending on execution by MediaTek and Google,” they wrote in a note dated Thursday. Part of this week’s excitement was due to news that Meta Platforms Inc. is in discussions to use Google TPUs in data centers in 2027. UBS sees further potential upside for MediaTek from additional ASIC projects with Meta. The sell-side overall is bullish on MediaTek, with 23 buy recommendations, 10 holds and no sells. The consensus price target projects a further 9% rise in the stock over the next year. In terms of future AI stock investing, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts including Arthur Lai say they “lean more” toward MediaTek and other Google partners over the Nvidia supply chain. “We view the current AI surge as less a speculative bubble but rather a necessary, capital-intensive build-out of a new, foundational technology layer,” they wrote in a report this week.

Title: The Only 3 Ways to Actually Make Money in B2B AI (And Why “AI-Enhanced” Doesn’t Count Anymore)

by Jason Lemkin | Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blog Posts, SaaStr.Ai Most B2B companies claiming to be “AI-powered” aren’t seeing growth accelerate. Not because their technology doesn’t work, but because they’re playing the wrong game entirely. Path 1: Attach to Compute Infrastructure Path 2: Replace Human Headcount Path 3: Massively Displace an Incumbent Everything else is noise in AI and B2B. Let’s break down why each works, how to know if you’re actually doing it, and where most companies go wrong. DataDog’s 23% stock surge after earnings wasn’t luck. It was the inevitable result of a simple principle: sell to the people building AI, and as they grow, you grow automatically. “The AI leaders, the hyperscalers — they’re starting to buy like classic B2B companies,” Jason explains. “They’re recycling the same people in procurement. So if you’re attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Rory adds critical context: “DataDog is a core piece of compute infrastructure and these hyperscalers are the most compute-intensive companies that have ever been known. If you’re selling compute stuff, you should be having a great quarter. If you’re selling routers, switches, interconnects, whatever it takes to stand up Stargate — you’re going to be golden.” The hyperscalers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta) are deploying unprecedented amounts of compute. They’re not just buying different things — they’re buying MORE of everything: Here’s the key insight: These companies buy like traditional B2B enterprises, just at 10x the scale and 10x the speed. OpenAI isn’t some mystical different creature when it comes to procurement. They need observability. They need security. They need data tools. They need all the same infrastructure any rapidly-scaling company needs — they just need more of it because they’re deploying more compute than any companies in history. Ask yourself these questions: If you can’t answer yes to at least 2-3 of these, you’re not actually playing the compute infrastructure game. Jason’s prediction: “If you have attached to AI budget and you’re a DataDog era, you’re actually going to have a great 2026.” Why? Because the infrastructure layer is just getting started. The capex spend on AI is still accelerating. Data center buildouts are still in early innings. The hyperscalers are still ramping their compute deployments. Every single piece of software that sits in that stack — from chip to model to deployment — is going to see explosive growth. But you need to actually be IN that stack, not adjacent to it. Here’s where companies get confused. They think, “We help AI companies be more productive, so we’re attached to AI.” No. That’s not the same thing. Compute-attached means your revenue scales automatically with compute deployment. It means you’re essential infrastructure, not a productivity enhancer. It means when Stargate comes online with $100B of compute, your revenue goes up whether you do anything or not. If you’re a project management tool that AI companies use, you’re not compute-attached. You’re just selling to hot companies. That’s fine, but don’t confuse it with the DataDog playbook. “Where are you replacing humans for real?” Jason asks. “Where are you going to go in and reduce the headcount that vendor needs by half?” This is the path most companies claim to be on but aren’t actually delivering. The difference between real human replacement and “AI-enhanced productivity” is stark. Jason runs through his experience deploying 20+ AI agents at SaaStr: “We have Reply for Replit (we call it ‘Reply’). We have RD for Artisan which is an SDR. We have Quali for Qualified. They all have these little desks where there’s no human at it anymore.” But here’s the critical distinction he makes about Replit’s V3 agent: “It is the first one that jumped the line to not being one of the parts of our team, but literally being part of our team just like a human being.” What makes it different? It’s sufficiently autonomous, knowledgeable and powerful to complete material high-value tasks on its own with some daily discussions just like on our team. Not “it helps us be more efficient.” Not “it automates some tasks.” It completes high-value work autonomously with the same level of oversight you’d give a human team member. Jason makes a crucial point: “Most of the time, ‘replacing humans’ is a story.” Here’s how to know if you’re actually replacing humans versus just telling yourself you are: Real Human Replacement: Fake Human Replacement (productivity story): Jason walks through how Gamma could evolve from Path 3 (displacement) to Path 2 (replacement): “When Gamma can do this — go into my Google Calendar, create prospectuses and sales collateral for all 20 sales calls this week, pull all the data on them last year from Salesforce and HubSpot and Marketo, put them all apart, review them once, and then distribute them to the team — Gamma’s part of our team.” That’s not “AI-enhanced PowerPoint creation.” That’s replacing a marketing operations person entirely. “It’s not that far away,” Jason notes. “Not just make me PowerPoint. When Gamma is part of your marketing team rather than a marketing tool, there’s a lot of revenue expansion if they can pull it off.” Jason identifies the key shift happening right now: “The co-pilot was the 2024 story. It didn’t work. It was a ripoff. Spend $30 more a month on Office like no one wanted the ripoff. This year OpenAI and Claude finally actually got good. That’s why Lovable, Replit, Gamma exploded. Next year is AI is part of your team.” 2024: Co-pilots (didn’t work) Tools that made you more efficient but required constant human oversight and direction. 2025: Agents that work (breakthrough year) Applications where AI finally got good enough to deliver real value autonomously. 2026: AI team members (what’s coming) AI that’s sufficiently autonomous to be actual members of your team, not just tools your team uses. That transition from tool to team member is where the revenue explosion happens. Because when AI is a team member, companies will pay team-member prices ($50K-$150K+ per year), not tool prices ($10-$100 per month). If you’re building a company to replace human headcount: Jason’s right that most companies avoid saying this explicitly, but the economics are undeniable: “If you are not removing humans from the equation, you are going to be heavily discounted.” The market is dividing into: You have to choose which game you’re playing. And if you choose Path 2, you need to actually deliver on human replacement, not just talk about it. “You have a third option,” Jason concedes. “Use AI to massively displace an incumbent and steal all the revenue. In fact, that’s the history of B2B software mostly.” This is the path that sounds most familiar to traditional B2B investors. It’s what Salesforce did to Siebel. What HubSpot did to Marketo (before Marketo became HubSpot). What Slack did to email for internal communication. But Jason is deeply skeptical this path works well in the AI era: “I just don’t know how many of our public leaders are in a place to steal their own revenue.” In the traditional SaaS era, you had ~3 years before incumbents would really compete: “You’d be like, well, Salesforce or HubSpot, whoever, it’ll take them like a year and a half to decide if it’s worth cloning. Then they’ll launch something and it’ll be okay because they have smart engineers, but it won’t actually do anything. The first six months it’ll be so feature poor. Then after two years they’ll decide, should I put 100 people on this?” That timeline has collapsed from 3 years to 30 days. Jason shares a brutal example: “I can think of one investment I’ve made that has had five clones in the first 30 days, including one from a cloud leader.” The AI-enabled cloning speed changes everything. Canva is now “borderline competitive” with Gamma — and Canva wasn’t even a competitor when Gamma’s CEO was on the show just months earlier. Jason’s skepticism crystallizes around the most obvious displacement opportunity: CRM. “There’s like 400 AI CRM startups out there all saying they’re going to eat HubSpot’s and Salesforce’s lunch. That’s not exciting to me as an investment. That’s much less exciting than truly replacing 90% of your GTM team.” Why isn’t this exciting? Jason isn’t saying Path 3 is impossible. He’s saying it’s the hardest path and requires specific conditions: You need at least 3 of these 4: The Duolingo discussion illuminates why incumbent displacement is so hard for public companies. Duolingo displaced Berlitz and traditional language schools. Hooray. But now what? Jason: “Where are you going to disrupt humans? This is your job. You already disrupted those humans. Unfortunately, they’re gone. Where’s the next level of human disruption?” Rory sees the opportunity: “The next generation of companies that are going to be teaching a foreign language will be LLM-based. We’ve seen companies doing more professional, more interactive teaching using LLMs. There’s a whole ton to be done in terms of one-on-one instruction.” But here’s the problem: Duolingo can’t easily displace itself. They have a business model built around light learning at consumer prices ($10-20/month). The AI opportunity is intensive learning at tutoring prices ($50-200/month). That requires cannibalizing their existing revenue model. This is why Path 3 is especially hard for incumbents. They’re not in a position to displace themselves. Which creates the opening for startups, but also means you’re starting from zero on distribution against companies with millions of users. Jason’s answer: Only if you can’t play Path 1 or Path 2. “We can fund those deals as investors, but I think the first two categories are much easier — attached to the compute or replace humans — rather than just steal.” The math is simple: All three can work. But Path 3 requires the most capital, the longest timeline, and has the highest failure rate. Jason drops a truth bomb midway through the discussion: “We’re in the Captain Obvious era of investing. You either got something or you ain’t getting funded anyway.” What does this mean for these three paths? If you’re on Path 1 (compute-attached): Your growth should be automatic. If the hyperscalers are deploying 3x more compute and your revenue isn’t growing 2-3x, something is broken. This should be the most “Captain Obvious” path of all. If you’re on Path 2 (replacing humans): Your customers should be measurably reducing headcount or headcount growth. If they’re not, you’re not actually replacing humans — you’re just a productivity tool. If you’re on Path 3 (displacing incumbents): You should be winning deals against the incumbent consistently, not just in small accounts. If you’re only winning when there’s no incumbent, you’re not displacing anyone. The test is simple: Is your success obvious? Or are you explaining why your metrics are actually good despite not looking impressive? Throughout the discussion, the panel keeps coming back to what doesn’t work: using AI to make your existing product better. Jason is blunt: “Using AI to make your product better? That’s table stakes now, not a competitive advantage.” This is the Duolingo problem. They’re using AI to improve their language learning. Great. Every single competitor can do that too. There’s no moat in “we use AI to make our product better.” Rory agrees: “Every single portfolio company at scale should be using AI by this point to make your product better. This is not 2023. You don’t get any kudos for sprinkling AI dust on your product.” In 2023: Adding AI features was novel and impressive. Companies could raise on “we’re adding AI to X.” In 2025: Adding AI features is expected. It’s like saying “we have a mobile app” in 2023. Cool, so does everyone else. The market has moved from “are you using AI?” to “how are you using AI to capture revenue in one of the three ways that actually work?” Let’s be explicit about what isn’t one of the three paths: Not Path 1: “We sell to AI companies” Unless you’re infrastructure they can’t build AI without, this is just selling to hot companies. When the AI boom ends or slows, your growth ends. Not Path 2: “We make teams more efficient with AI” Unless headcount actually goes down or dramatically slows its growth, you’re not replacing humans. You’re selling productivity software. That’s fine, but it’s not Path 2. Not Path 3: “We’re better than the incumbent because we have AI” Unless you’re 10x better and winning head-to-head deals consistently, you’re not displacing anyone. You’re just another alternative. Harry shares a data point that shows how much the market has shifted: A classic enterprise SaaS company grew from $400K to $3M ARR (10x growth). Five years ago, this would have generated five term sheets from top firms. Today: 120 meetings, one term sheet at 12x revenue. Why? Because it’s not playing any of the three games. It’s not compute-attached. It’s not replacing humans. And it’s not dramatically displacing an incumbent with AI. It’s just a good SaaS company growing well. That’s not good enough anymore. Jason: “It’s the most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You’re either Captain Obvious getting funded, or you’re not seeing it anywhere.” If you’re building a company or investing in one, here’s how to think about which path to pursue: Best for: Infrastructure engineers who understand ML workflows, companies with existing relationships in cloud/DevOps Best for: Founders who have done the job they’re replacing, deep understanding of workflow completion, strong AI/agent expertise Best for: Domain experts in industries with weak incumbents, founders with deep incumbent knowledge, situations with massive technological discontinuity If you can do Path 1, do Path 1. It’s the easiest and most capital-efficient. If you can’t do Path 1, do Path 2. The market for replacing humans is massive and underpenetrated. Only do Path 3 if you can’t do the first two or if you have specific advantages (domain expertise, weak incumbent, vertical specialization) that make it compelling. Jason’s final point ties it all together: “If you’re in software today and this isn’t the most exciting time of your lifetime, you’re doing it wrong. This is the first time software has gotten better since the three of us met.” But that excitement only matters if you’re playing one of the three games that actually capture revenue: Everything else — all the “AI-enhanced” products, all the “using AI to be better” positioning, all the sprinkling of AI dust on existing products — that’s not going to generate venture-scale returns. The market is telling us this clearly. DataDog up 23%. Duolingo down 25%. Same week. Both “using AI.” One playing a winning game, one not. Choose your path wisely. Because in 2025/2026, there are only three that actually work. Founder SaaStr Email Address Company Job Title Email Address Get from $0 to $100 Million in ARRwith less stress and more success.

Following the launch of Gemini 3 with advanced capabilities across video, reasoning, and coding, Google is now the talk of the town in the generative AI category. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently admitted that the Gemini team had done a great job with the launch. Even NVIDIA, which has also been flying high due to the high demand for chips to foster AI advances (unlocking $4 trillion in market capitalization), recently indicated that it is delighted by Google's success (via Tom's Hardware). But perhaps more interestingly, the chipmaker used the opportunity to toot its own horn: "Nvidia is a generation ahead of the industry — it's the only platform that runs every AI model and does it everywhere computing is done. Nvidia offers greater performance, versatility, and fungibility than ASICs, which are designed for specific AI frameworks or functions." This news comes after reports claim that Meta is currently in discussions with Google to rent its Cloud Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) in 2026, and even potentially buy them in the subsequent year. Consequently, Alphabet (Google's parent company) and Meta's stock prices saw a significant increase. However, NVIDIA's stock price dropped by 3%.

For context, the former's offerings are designed to help with AI model training and inference, while the latter are designed for parallel processing, allowing them to handle billions of calculations simultaneously. While speaking to CNBC, a Google spokesman indicated: “We are experiencing accelerating demand for both our custom TPUs and Nvidia GPUs. We are committed to supporting both, as we have for years.” During NVIDIA's earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang addressed the rising TPU competition, indicating that Google is the company's customer for GPU chips and that Gemini can run on its technology.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Nvidia's sterling armor was dented this month. After years of meteoric success, the chipmaker and its CEO Jensen Huang have increasingly found themselves playing defense — an unusual position for the company. Nvidia headed into the month with its stock price at an all-time high, bolstered by increasing AI spending from some of its major Big Tech customers like Meta, Microsoft, and Google. Huang was hot off of Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, where he dismissed any concerns of an AI bubble and sounded jubilant. But over the course of the month, which saw Nvidia shed 11% of its value, the chipmaker has gone from smashing earnings and alleviating Wall Street's AI bubble fears to becoming the poster boy of what some analysts view as a company on an unsustainable path. Nvidia has also had to fend off short-sellers and the growing threat of Google, picking up some bruises along the way. Big names, including SoftBank and Peter Thiel, cashed out on the Wall Street darling that had became the world's first $4 trillion market cap company mere months ago. SoftBank announced it fully exited its Nvidia position, selling $5.8 billion in shares to bet on OpenAI. And while its CFO stressed it had "nothing to do with Nvidia itself," the move didn't exactly dispel the ongoing AI bubble talk. Nvidia defiantly pushed back on any investor skittishness when it released its third-quarter earnings on November 19, surpassing analysts' already lofty expectations — no small feat — at a time when concerns about the AI bubble were once again creeping up. "There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble," Huang told analysts on a call following the results. "From our vantage point, we see something very different." But while shares rallied in after-hours trading following the results, markets did a U-turn the following day as hand-wringing over ballooning tech valuations and spending continued. Behind closed doors, Huang privately told employees in remarks first reported by Business Insider that "the market did not appreciate" Nvidia's "incredible" quarter. Facing sky-high expectations and the position of being a bellwether for the AI industry, Huang described the chipmaker as being in a somewhat no-win situation. "If we delivered a bad quarter, it is evidence there's an AI bubble. If we delivered a great quarter, we are fueling the AI bubble," Huang said during an all-hands meeting. It didn't take long for things to get a bit choppy for the chipmaker. Shares of Nvidia fell after The Information reported that Google was engaged in talks with Meta to provide the social network billions worth of the tech giant's own advanced chips. While Nvidia's chips have long been the gold standard in the AI race, a hot commodity used by tech giants and startups to train and run LLMs and chatbots, the news suggested that the chipmaker's market share might be under threat. With Google now eyeing Nvidia's lunch, the market digested a possible future where Nvidia may no longer be the star attraction. Nvidia's market losses following the news appeared to be Google's gain, with its parent company Alphabet now positioned to join the $4 trillion club that Nvidia started. And in a move that raised some eyebrows, Nvidia released a mostly defiant statement that praised Google's success but said Nvidia's chips are "a generation ahead of the industry." The developments acted as fuel for Michael Burry of "The Big Short" fame, who has become increasingly vocal about voicing his doubts about Nvidia. Burry, who has a particularly dour view of the AI industry, spent much of the month questioning the longevity of Nvidia's chips, its stock dilution, and its circular, "give-and-take deals" in AI. The investor recently leaned into online writing and labeled Nvidia as the Cisco of the AI bubble era in one of his first Substack posts. "And once again there is a Cisco at the center of it all, with the picks and shovels for all and the expansive vision to go with it," Burry wrote. "Its name is Nvidia." The chipmaker didn't take the criticism lying down. In a note to Wall Street sell-side analysts, a copy of which was obtained by Business Insider, Nvidia took exception to Burry's claims, stating that he appeared to have "incorrectly" made some of his calculations. The memo also pushed back against views that Nvidia is too entangled in circular financial arrangements with some of its customers. "First, Nvidia's strategic investments represent a small share of Nvidia's revenue and an even smaller share of approximately $1T raised each year across global private capital markets," the memo said, adding, "The companies in Nvidia's strategic investment portfolio predominantly generate revenue from third-party customers, not from Nvidia." Burry called Nvidia's response "disappointing" and disclosed that he "continues to own puts" on Nvidia. While November undoubtedly turned up the heat on Nvidia, the chipmaker continues to be the world's most valuable company by market cap and its shares have slightly rebounded in recent days, closing up 1.37% on Wednesday. The world's largest tech companies rely on Nvidia's chips and have committed to spend billions and billions on the latest generation. CEO Jensen Huang has said sales of its latest Blackwell chips have been "off the charts." Nvidia's CFO, Colette Kress, told analysts earlier this month that the company is on track to bring in "half a trillion" in AI chip orders during the combined 2025-2026 period — a number that she said "will grow" as more deals are struck. While Nvidia's bruising back half of the month is a reminder that even AI royalty can see its crown threatened, Huang had some words for the doubters during the company's earnings call. "As a reminder, Nvidia is unlike any other accelerator," he said. "We excel at every phase of AI, from pre-training and post-training to inference." Jump to

Title: The new plan for Urban Planning Authorities, the Eurogroup on K.M.’s agenda with Weber, CVC sells marinas in a €1.5 billion deal, the Church and the auction

Hello, I find political news today less interesting than two other issues that are much more serious. The first concerns that tragic accident last Friday in Pagrati, in which an 84-year-old driver hit and killed a 75-year-old woman who was walking with her 30-year-old daughter with disabilities. When, finally, in this country will elderly people undergo serious tests in order to renew — or NOT renew — their driver’s license? It is time to put an end to an issue that literally kills innocent people. The second concerns the sudden work stoppage by STASY, due to a tragic accident that occurred in one of the company’s engine sheds in Piraeus. The work stoppage on the metro and tram paralyzed all of Athens yesterday afternoon and caused hardship to hundreds of thousands of citizens. The incident is tragic, but there is a prosecutor and an investigating judge looking into it and, if there is responsibility, it will be assigned through the Justice system. What is gained, and by whom, from making all of Athens suffer? Will working conditions change because of yesterday’s strike? Since the Thessaloniki International Fair, Stavros Papastavrou and Dimitris Papastergiou sat down to design how the reform announced by K.M. at the Fair will be implemented — specifically, the transfer of Urban Planning Offices from municipalities to the Cadastre. The plan has been prepared, will be presented today to the Cabinet, will begin to be implemented on a pilot basis in 2026, and fully by 2027. What it practically provides: integration of the Urban Planning Offices into the Cadastre Offices, both in substance and in the information system, and of course a reduction in physical contact points, through the digitalization of procedures. My understanding is that there will be one local Cadastre office per regional capital and one central office per region. Also, with the digital pool of cases, when one Urban Planning Office has a heavy workload, another with less can handle the work, without requiring contact with the engineer, the citizen, etc. Today at 20:00 K.M. has a scheduled dinner with the president of the EPP, Manfred Weber, who is in Athens with the candidate prime minister of the state of Baden-Württemberg, Manuel Hagel. Under other circumstances the dinner would be social in nature, but here it is obvious that K.M. wants to lobby on the issue of the Eurogroup and the prospect of the EPP supporting Pierre’s candidacy, who has just returned from Berlin. With K.M. at the central Athens restaurant will be Chatzidakis, who is also vice-president of the EPP, and ND’s Secretary for International Relations, Tasos Chatzivasileiou, who gets along well with the Germans. I asked my source who was describing the plan whether the matter of the Urban Planning Offices will stir up local reactions, as happened with the Hellenic Post. “Look, there are municipalities that react, but we do not want to put the mayors in opposition. There are also municipalities that don’t want to have anything to do with Urban Planning Offices,” he told me. As for the staff of the Urban Planning Offices, those who wish will be given the right to remain in the new structure, but if they do not want to, they will be absorbed into other services. I understand that perhaps even before year-end there may be an agreement between the government and industrialists on the issue of electricity and the subsidy that SEV is insistently demanding. After the issue of collective agreements, President Spyros Theodoropoulos has set course for an agreement and is in open communication with both K.M. and Chatzidakis. If I can make an estimate, the agreement will probably be somewhat less than what the industrialists wanted, but still—better than nothing… At the end of the week ND’s leadership will sit down to draft the plan for the party’s pre-congresses, which will pave the way for the party congress after Easter. There is information circulating that the start may be in Patras in the first ten days of December, but there is also the view that there is no point in doing anything before the holidays, as the party mechanism has already been mobilized one way or another due to internal elections. Therefore, the start may come in January, while the cities that will host the at least four pre-congresses will also be finalized. And we move on to market news with an interesting story about a fresh deal in the making. According to information, CVC is launching a process to sell D-Marin, the company that owns and manages marinas. It is a major deal, as the price is estimated to reach €1.5 billion. The Greek interest lies in the fact that included in the “package” coming to market are the marinas of Zea, Pylos, Lefkada, and the large marina in Gouvia, Corfu. According to the same sources, the sale process is taking place abroad. D-Marin owns 26 marinas in nine countries — Greece, Malta, Turkey, Croatia, Italy, France, Spain, Montenegro, and Albania. They sweated, but they are approaching the finish line. This concerns Masoutis and the acquisition of Kritikos, which barring surprises will be finalized by year-end. Initial estimates pointed to October, but it turned out not to be a walk in the park. The deal creates the third-largest player in the supermarket market in terms of turnover. Competitors argue that it will take time until the new entity is well organized and operates smoothly. Many shares of British gambling companies “went into the bucket” as the Labour government — making a dramatic effort to increase state revenue — decided to raise taxes on online gambling. The Remote Gaming Duty (RGD), imposed on online gambling, will rise to 40% in April 2026 from today’s 21%.Finance Minister Rachel Reeves aims to add over £1 billion annually to the state budget as a result of the new levies. However, the tax increase leads to a significant rise in costs for gambling companies, especially those offering online casino, betting, etc., with consequences for their suppliers and the entire sector’s chain. This may reduce profit margins, especially for smaller companies; some may be forced to downsize or restructure their activities through mergers or even leaving the market. Analysts believe there will be a drop in investment in the sector, as the increased tax burden makes the market less attractive.In this climate, the most affected shares were those of companies with high exposure to the British market. A characteristic example is Evoke (888, William Hill, etc.), which dropped 14%, while Entain (Ladbrokes, Coral, etc.) managed to absorb the pressure, and Flutter (Paddy Power, Betfair, FanDuel, etc.) closed in positive territory as it has significant presence in the U.S. Intralot, now controlled by Bally’s Interactive, was hit hard on the Athens Stock Exchange (-17%, at €0.92) due to its significant dependence on the UK market, since 60% of the new entity’s activities take place in the UK, where, among other things, it operates the highly popular online brand Monopoly Casino. Analysts consider the price of €80 million that OPAP will pay for the State Lotteries to be fair, if not advantageous. The company won the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) tender for the 12-year concession of the exclusive management rights of the State Lotteries. It will pay a lump sum of €80 million, as well as 30% of gross profit annually, with a minimum guaranteed annual payment of €20 million. In April 2026, the current contract for the Lotteries held by Hellenic Lotteries expires, so OPAP managed to keep them in its portfolio until 2038. It is also noteworthy that OPAP will now have 100% of Hellenic Lotteries S.A., the company that has been running the State Lotteries to date, since Scientific Games is selling its 16.5% stake. Yesterday we also had the management’s conference call for the nine-month results, but no news emerged, and analysts and the market now await updates on the Allwyn–OPAP merger at the upcoming Capital Markets Update. The legal saga of Folli Follie continues, and at the latest hearing (November 25), objections were filed by the defendants — D. Koutsolioutsos, Aik. Koutsolioutsou and I. Begeitis — against the participation of shareholders supporting the accusation for fraud and forgery. Similar objections were filed against the participation of HCAP and EFKA. All objections will be decided at the next hearing. Regarding the FF request, the court announced it will give the floor only after its decision on the guilt or innocence of the defendants — that is, at the end of the trial. Despite the fact that this procedural order is provided by law and was followed at first instance, in practice, for cases such as this, it amounts to a form of “penalty” against the damaged party, who ends up being heard last, when everything has already been decided. The trial was again adjourned, to December 18, 2025. It is worth noting that the hearing at the Court of Appeal was originally set to begin on April 9, 2025, but since then it has been constantly postponed — from adjournment to suspension and back again. Time passes, the case drags on, and the administration of justice is tested by its own delays. Early this morning, at the five-star September City Resort Spa & Conference operated by Hotel Brain, in Pylaia, Thessaloniki, the entry of Telis Mystakidis into PAOK BC (KAE PAOK) is officially announced. The entrance into the new era begins with an “injection” of 5.5 million euros from the new major shareholder, while immediately afterwards a large share-capital increase will follow. To make all this happen, an extraordinary General Assembly of PAOK BC shareholders has already been convened for December 17, as required by the institutional framework, with the main item being the election of a new Board of Directors. This process constitutes the final formal step for the full and clean transition to the new ownership structure. It is well-known that the Church of Greece owns large real-estate holdings throughout the country. Now, however, these are the reason it appears on the lists of electronic auctions—albeit indirectly. To avoid misunderstanding: this is not a hammer due to debts, nor is it being hunted by servicers. As the column learns, it is found—formally—in the position of debtor, with a private individual as the party initiating the auction, because she and the Church are co-owners, each holding 50%, of a “prime” plot in Thessaloniki. In this auction, scheduled for 28 January 2026, in the position of “defendant–co-owner–party against whom the auction is directed,” appears the Legal Entity of Public Law under the name “Church of Greece,” headquartered on Iasiou Street in Athens. The entire procedure is based on a recent decision of the Multi-Member Court of First Instance of Thessaloniki, ordering the partition of the plot. It is a complete and buildable plot of 310 sq.m. in the municipality of Thessaloniki, on Polyxenis Antoniou Street, at the borders of the historic center and Ano Poli, near the Ministry of Macedonia–Thrace. Among the scenarios examined in the valuation report was its division, which was not advantageous, while the preferred solution proposed was either selling it as a whole or exploiting it by constructing a multi-story building and distributing the resulting horizontal properties. And so we arrived at the auction, which will take place with a starting price of €402,000. As for the ownership titles, they go as far back as a Royal Decree from 1952. In New York, Petros Pappas continues to be one of the few Greek constants closely monitored by the funds in the dry-bulk market. And it’s not only the financial results of the third quarter of 2025—net income $18.5 million, EBITDA $73.6 million, and an average daily charter rate of $16,634/day—that drew attention. Pappas’ philosophy continues to be read like a manual of financial discipline: the 19th consecutive dividend, steadily $0.11/share (with cumulative returns of $13.12/share since 2021), and above all, dedication to value creation through streamlining the share base. There aren’t many Greek shipowners talked about at trading desks for their buybacks, but Star Bulk has already “burned” about 5 million shares, investing $82.1 million, while another “wallet” of $91.4 million remains available. On Wall Street, this translates as follows: “Pappas knows what his stock is worth and buys when others hesitate.” It is the classic recipe of value operators who are not afraid of volatility, as long as the balance sheet can withstand it. At the same time, Pappas does not miss the chance to buy tonnage when prices are right. The three Kamsarmax newbuilding resales from a Chinese shipyard, delivering in Q3 2026, are read by analysts as a targeted bet on the fleet tightness ahead. The age fatigue of the global bulk fleet is now a given, while regulatory uncertainty—from U.S.–China fee measures to the postponed decision on the IMO Net Zero Framework—works more in favor of strong balance sheets than against them. The week in shipbuilding confirms a pattern that, on Wall Street, is now considered structural: Greek shipowners act as the most consistent source of demand for new tonnage in sectors with different cycles and risk profiles. In bulkers, Atlantic Bulk Carriers is methodically expanding its footprint with four new supramaxes in China—continuation of an order sequence reflecting confidence in future freight rates despite volatility. Pricing at $33.75 million per unit places the company in the “value buyers” zone, exploiting stable construction costs before new inflationary pressures appear. The moves by Danaos and Oceanbulk in container ships reveal a parallel reading of the market: feeder orders remain strong, as supply chains are being reconfigured and regional feedering gains importance. The fact that Danaos is closing a six-vessel 1,800-teu series at a yard specializing in LPG carriers shows the Chinese industry is seeking more flexible capacity use. Meanwhile, Oceanbulk’s two 3,100-teu ships indicate that Greek owners are operating in the “mid-size box” category, where the greatest supply–demand balance is expected after 2026. In the tanker market, VLCC orders have increased in intensity and frequency. Maran Tankers returns with four new vessels at Hanwha Ocean, while a parallel European order at HD Hyundai shipyards shows the crude-oil market is renewing a fleet that has aged faster than the historical average. Prices at $128–130 million indicate that shipyards have regained bargaining power and owners are pricing in resilient earnings over the next four years. The appearance of two LNG carriers in HD KSOE’s books is the exception proving the rule: the LNG market remains conservative with new orders. Workings and backstage movements at the headquarters of the International Maritime Organization, where Vassilis Kikilias represents the country ahead of the electoral process for Category A, in which Greece aims for first place. Given that the IMO is the maritime arm of the UN, what I can tell you is that in the days before the elections, interesting diplomatic games take place with votes and balances as bargaining chips. The Greek delegation has a clear goal: to remind partners of Greece’s role in international shipping—not as a given, but as a responsibility it wants to continue serving. In private meetings, the minister repeated the spirit of his speech: respect for procedures, commitment to cooperation, and a discreet but clear reminder that “Greeks are people of the sea.” The three-member delegation of the Single Resolution Board (SRB) in Athens, led by the well-dressed Czech gentleman and the exceptionally discreet Asian-origin lady, did not hide their enthusiasm after their meetings with the managements of Greek banks. SRB visits are never “courtesy calls” or filled with pleasantries. They arrive with a pre-prepared questionnaire seeking gaps in MREL capital adequacy, the ability for rapid asset transfers, and the readiness of IT systems to operate under emergency conditions. Particular attention this year was paid to the cross-border activities of Greek banks. It appears the inspection results were absolutely satisfactory—something they reportedly did not hide in their final assessment. Aegean’s market capitalization reached €1.3 billion, as it closely follows the trajectory of major European airlines hoping for an end to the war in Ukraine. The European aviation index Stoxx Europe Total Market Airlines recorded another rise yesterday (+1.91%) and on a weekly basis its gains exceeded +5.40%. The index is composed of shares of 10 airlines (Ryanair, IAG, Lufthansa, EasyJet, Air France–KLM, Norwegian Air Shuttle, Wizzair, Finnair, Enter Air, and Norse Atlantic), all of which always trade at valuations lower than justified by their figures, as the sector is extremely sensitive to climate or geopolitical shifts. Over the past week—since even faint echoes of peace have been heard—there has been significant capital inflow into the aviation sector, and Aegean is benefiting from this trend. On 19 November, Aegean’s share price was €13.14; yesterday we saw it at €14.60. In last Monday’s session, 158 thousand shares changed hands; on Tuesday the number nearly doubled to 257 thousand, and yesterday, Wednesday, exceeded 100 thousand shares. AEGEAN continues to stand out for its cash position, holding €379 million in net cash, while implementing an ambitious investment plan that will allow it to spread its wings even to India. High-level international delegations have recently been visiting Sunlight’s factory in Xanthi. Recently, a French delegation led by the French Consul General in Thessaloniki visited the facility, while a few weeks earlier, there had been a large visit of Defense Attachés from 23 countries across 5 continents. The close timing and nature of these two visits are not considered coincidental. France, as the second-largest market for industrial batteries in Europe, represents a strategic market for Sunlight, which simultaneously maintains a long-standing international presence in the market for energy solutions for defense applications. The Greek multinational group Sunlight is rapidly strengthening its role in the new international environment, where energy independence, security, and technological innovation are acquiring decisive importance. Excluding Intralot, which we mentioned above (-17.27% at €0.92) and its issues with the British budget, which dragged down all shares of the Kokkalis Group in its decline, yesterday’s session was a victory for balanced growth. The sixth consecutive upward session pushed the General Index above 2,100 points (2,106.9, +0.94%) with increased trading value of €311.55 million, including €70.6 million in pre-agreed block trades. Banks performed well and raised the pace, but the rise spread across almost all blue-chip stocks, with a clear protagonist being the DEI (Public Power Corporation) share (+2.29% at €7.19), for which investment firms are publishing a series of positive reports these days. Eurobank (+3.62% at €3.52) had many supporters yesterday, and trading in the stock approached €70 million (€49.6 million in blocks). National Bank (+3.38% at €13.06) and Piraeus (+2.31% at €7.19) also raised expectations high, while Alpha (+0.86% at €3.64) continues upward steadily without spikes. Notable is the performance of TITAN, which again reached the price of €45.6 (+1.22%). The mere publication of the news immediately knocked NVIDIA’s stock down by -6%. However, the consequences are broader. Zuckerberg’s Meta (Facebook) announced that it chose Google’s TPU chips instead of Nvidia’s GPUs. In doing so, it broke the monopoly that Nvidia had built in AI infrastructure. Nvidia immediately issued a press release expressing its “enthusiasm” for “Google’s success,” while simultaneously losing $250 billion in market capitalization. At the same time, it reminded that “we continue to supply Google,” since Google still depends on Nvidia’s H100 and GB200 chips for the most demanding AI tasks. Nvidia did not want to attack its best customer directly, despite its “infidelity.” For this reason, it made sure to remind the market that its own chips offer “greater performance and flexibility.” It aimed to warn every other hyperscaler and every company considering following Meta’s example. But for the rest of the market, the message is clear: Nvidia’s dominance is being challenged. Its stock lost 11% in ten days. Google’s TPUs are cheaper, may be limited in certain functions, but competition has knocked on the door of costly Nvidia, and this is just the beginning of another war at the heart of Artificial Intelligence. The submission of the 2026 Budget by the Labor government in the UK targets all those who have chosen London as a taxation base for their income. Savers and property income earners will face a straight tax increase of 2 percentage points on income from interest, rents, and dividends. This means that taxes on savings income start at 22%, rise to 42%, and reach 47%. Dividend tax rates rise to 10.75% for basic-rate taxpayers and go up to 35.75% at higher scales. Chancellor Reeves has budgeted an additional £500 million per year in tax revenues from savings and property income, and an additional £1.2 billion from dividends. For decades, the London market attracted income-focused investors precisely because of the large number of companies paying generous dividends every year. Clearly, these developments also concern Greeks who have purchased apartments in London to collect rent, as they now face a new headache. The tax increase comes in a context of rising inflation, high living costs, and increasing financial pressures. Explore related questions

Title: The Bull Case for Vaalco Energy and Its African Assets

During his thirty-eight year career he worked on six-continents in field and… More Info Vaalco Energy (NYSE:EGY) is small cap, Houston, Texas-based producer of oil and gas. Its original focus was offshore in the African country of Gabon, but a few years ago it diversified through a beneficial merger that expanded its global footprint. The company delivered a strong Q-4, 2023 earnings report that included news of its further diversification and entry into Côte d'Ivoire. The stock rallied to nearly $8.00 per share following the release of that report. A mixed report for Q-2 that year took the wind out of the company's sails, and thus began the long slide to the current $3.33 level. Now the Q-3 report is out, and there could be some reason for optimism for a rebound in the company’s shares, despite a miss on EPS and revenue. At a glance, the company trades at low multiples and is currently well below its 200 Day SMA of $3.90 per share. This bodes well for finding a favorable recommendation on EGY. In this article, we will dig into the particulars on EGY and come up with an investment recommendation for the stock. First we will take a quick look at the macro picture for oil. The crude oil macro The oversupply narrative is dominating trading in upstream equities. Crude oil has fallen about 30% thus far this year and may not have yet tested a bottom. Compounding current sluggishness is the war premium that had added back ~$10.00 to the price has leaked away as two of the three international hotbeds of belligerence-Israel/Gaza, and Ukraine/Russia, have shown signs of slowing to a simmer recently, a step down from outright hostilities. Peace, while a noble objective, is not good for business in oil and gas, as fears of a supply interruption keep traders long futures contracts in times of belligerence. When things calm down, the contracts are dumped on the market and must find a home, at a price. One spot worth keeping an eye on is Venezuela, as the U.S. turns the screws on the Maduro regime. A war in our hemisphere, so near the booming Guyanese ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) Stabroeck project, could have profound consequences. Geopolitical volatility makes it important to pick your entry points carefully when investing in upstream oil and gas companies. There is good news on the horizon for those who take the plunge, however. Fortunately, demand remains strong and has decades to run if the new forecast from the International Energy Agency (IEA) is any guide. Fears of stranded barrels being written off on oil companies' balance sheets are less prevalent than a few years ago. The thesis for Vaalco Vaalco has been growing production since its merger with TransGlobe in 2022. This transformed the company from sole reliance on its Gabonese assets to a diversified player with a number of levers to pull globally. A move last year into Côte d'Ivoire was viewed favorably, and EGY just farmed into another offshore block in that country. In the short run, the company's focus has been on ramping up production in its Egyptian concession and Gabon. Results have been uneven with production progress and efficiency increases in Egypt, offset by a production turnaround and an FPSO refurbishment, combined with rig-related drilling delays in Gabon. This has pushed expected production from a new drilling campaign to the right, adversely impacting the stock. As the slide below notes, the shutdown and the near completion of the FPSO refurbishment, and then next the arrival of, Borr Drilling's Norve jack up is underway and should spud the first well sometime this month. Vaalco trades at a low EV/EBITDA multiple-2.8X, and a low flowing barrel valuation- $19K per barrel. Analysts here and on Wall Street rank the company as a strong buy. Price targets are $10.00 per share, but EPS estimates point to small losses over the next couple of quarters, which could delay any rally in the stock. The company has a quarter of its Q-4 production hedged at $ 60 and plans to increase this to about half. In 2026, EGY plans to hedge about 40% of its daily output. The company is returning capital to shareholders through a 6.5% dividend yield. The company has a small amount of LT debt and has been implementing a capital reduction and cost-cutting program that should improve cash flow and production. Catalysts for EGY An explorer's job is to find oil and gas. Full stop. Operating oil and gas assets is also enhanced by the adjacency of other assets. Sometimes this is called critical mass. It enables cost optimization through several avenues. Gaining operatorship over a block where seismic has already been shot for $3 million seems like a reasonably derisked proposition to me. Someone thought Block CI-705 offshore, Côte d'Ivoire, was prospective enough to shoot seismic, which isn't cheap, so it could be like the last person to pull the handle on a slot machine. Or it could lead to nothing. That's exploration. Dry holes are instructive as well. TotalEnergies, (NYSE: TTE) drilled a test in 2021, and DH'd it. Why did they drill it? Why does anyone think this area might be prospective? Well, if you go back 400 million years and put the puzzle pieces together to form Gondwana, you find the area now known as Côte d'Ivoire fits nicely adjacent to the areas known as Guyana and Suriname. That should cement it in your head as to what the Geo-types have in the back of their minds at EGY. This sort of thinking about the Atlantic Margin has led to the well-publicized discoveries in Guyana, Suriname, and Namibia. Snapshot of Atlantic basin (Google Maps) This is all down the road a piece, even in the success case. In the near term, we have the upcoming drilling campaigns in Gabon, Egypt, and the Baobab field in Côte d'Ivoire -EGY's legacy position from the TransGlobe merger. No catalyst discussion would be complete without at least a mention of EGY's 60% interest in Block P, offshore Equatorial Guinea. As of this date, a Plan of Development has been approved, and a Joint Operating Agreement is in place. Although Venus (Not to be confused with Total's Venus discovery offshore Namibia) As the slide below discusses, there is future prospectivity in this block. And the two producers and one injector needed to bring on Venus could be done in 2026. Canada is taking a backseat after several successes in the company's Cardium and Mannville plays in Alberta, with no further drilling planned until 2026. The slide below shows the 2.50-mile horizontal section performing nearly as well as the 3.0-mile type curve. Q-3, 2025 for EGY Most notably, the company hit the upper range of most production estimates, but cash flow suffered due to softness in Brent prices. Guidance for the full year expects 5% uplift YoY. Capex was reduced due to the issues with Gabon to optimize cash flow for the quarter. Even so, the company had to call upon its revolver for current expenses. Otherwise, the company has no debt. Company filings Risks to the thesis for EGY Even great deals can get cheaper. Picking an entry point can be frustrating as fundamentals continue to weaken. That's the era we are in right now. As I laid out in the Macro, there are many moving pieces driving oil prices, and most of them are not supportive. No matter how good the price of EGY stock looks relative to the recent past, it can always get cheaper when the market turns against upstream investors. Your takeaway EGY’s report reads pretty well. And EGY management is due some deference for their experience in West African operations, going back decades. Their balance sheet management also speaks well for the company. Borrowing money to support operations when interruptions in other projects present cash flow hiccups is no big deal. The company retains ample liquidity, assuming refurbishment with the FPSO goes according to plan. In my view, Vaalco's strong balance sheet, prospects for improving cash flow in the next year, and low multiples, put a buy target squarely on the company at its current level. The company is currently trading in a range well below its 50 and 200 day SMAs, which is probably more induced by the depressed pricing of Brent than anything else. I am giving EGY a Strong for investors with a high risk profile, seeking capital growth and competitive shareholder returns.
