UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing.

Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share our most current thinking on the database marketplace and dig into Snowflake’s execution, some of its challenges and we’ll take a look at how others are making moves to solve customer challenges; and angling to get their piece of the growing database pie.

Episode 86 – How Nvidia plans to own the data center with AI – Nvidia wants to completely transform enterprise computing by making datacenters run 10X faster at 1/10th the cost. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we believe Nvidia is in a strong position to power the world’s computing centers and how it plans to disrupt the grip that x86 architectures have had on the datacenter market for decades. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 85 – Your Online Assets Aren’t Safe – Is Cloud the Problem or the Solution? – The convenience of online access to bank accounts, payment apps, crypto exchanges and other transaction systems has created enormous risks, which the vast majority of individuals either choose to ignore or simply don’t understand. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will try to raise awareness about a growing threat to your liquid assets and hopefully inspire you to do some research and take actions to lower the probability of you losing thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 84 – Debunking the Cloud Repatriation Myth – Cloud repatriation is a term often used by technology companies that don’t operate a public cloud. The marketing narrative most typically implies that customers have moved work to the public cloud and, for a variety of reasons – expense, performance, security, etc. Some have written about the repatriation myth, but in this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share hard data from ETR and other sources that we feel debunks the repatriation narrative as it’s currently being promoted. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 83 – Chaos Creates Cash for Criminals & Cyber Companies – The pandemic not only accelerated a shift to digital, it highlighted a rush of cyber criminal sophistication, collaboration and chaotic responses from virtually every major company on the planet. The SolarWinds hack exposed digital supply chain weaknesses and appears to have accelerated so-called island hopping techniques that are exceedingly difficult to detect. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our quarterly update on the security industry and share new survey data from ETR and theCUBE community that will help you navigate through the maze of corporate cyber warfare. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 82 – Why Apple Could be the Key to Intel’s Future – The latest Arm Neoverse announcement further cements our opinion that its architecture, business model and ecosystem execution are defining a new era of computing; and leaving Intel in its dust. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explain why and how Apple could hold a key to saving Intel’s (and America’s) semiconductor industry leadership position. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 81 – A Digital Skills Gap Signals Rebound in IT Services Spend – Recent survey data from ETR shows that enterprise tech spending is tracking with projected U.S. GDP growth at 6% to 7% this year. Many markers continue to point the way to a strong recovery including hiring trends and the loosening of frozen IT project budgets. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR, who will share fresh data, perspectives and insights from the latest survey data.

Episode 79 – Moore’s Law is Accelerating and AI is Ready to Explode – Moore’s Law is dead right? Think again. While the historical annual CPU performance improvement of ~40% is slowing, the combination of CPUs packaged with alternative processors is improving at a rate of more than 100% per annum. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is going to unveil some data that suggests we’re entering a new era of innovation where inexpensive processing capabilities will power an explosion of machine intelligence applications. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 78 – Arm Lays Down the Gauntlet at Intel’s Feet – Exactly one week after Pat Gelsinger unveiled plans to reinvent Intel, Arm announced version 9 of its architecture and put forth its vision for the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will explain why we think this announcement is so important and what it means for Intel and the broader technology landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 77 – Intel… Too Strategic to Fail – Intel’s big announcement this week underscores the threat that the United States faces from China. The U.S. needs to lead in semiconductor design and manufacturing; and that lead is slipping because Intel has been fumbling the ball over the past several years. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will peel the onion of Intel’s announcement, explain why we’re not as sanguine as was Wall Street on Intel’s prospects and lay out what we think needs to take place for Intel to once again become top gun; and for us to gain more confidence. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 76 – Tech Spending Powers the Roaring 2020s as Cloud Remains a Staple of Growth – In the year 2020, it was good to be in tech. It was even better to be in the cloud as organizations had to rely on remote cloud services to keep things running. In this Breaking analysis Dave will provide our take on the latest ETR COVID survey and share why we think the tech boom will continue well into the future. Watch the full video analysis.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry reveals fresh bets on Meta, Alibaba, and UnitedHealth
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/big-short-michael-burry-stock-portfolio-alibaba-meta-unitedhealth-buffett-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-15T01:45:27Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry bet big on stocks in the second quarter, swapping out bearish put options for bullish call options and adding several fresh holdings to his portfolio. The investor of "The Big Short" fame revealed in a quarterly filing on Thursday that he purchased calls on Alibaba, ASML, JD.com, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Meta, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and VF last quarter. Burry's Scion Asset Management also built direct stakes in Bruker, Lululemon, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and MercadoLibre, while cutting his direct wager on Estee Lauder from 200,000 shares to 150,000. The UnitedHealth wager is notable as Warren Buffett, one of Burry's key influences, also invested in the health insurer last quarter via his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. Call options give investors the right to buy a certain number of a company's shares at a fixed price within a set period, allowing them to lock in a purchase price that may be lower than the market price. Similarly, investors can use put options to lock in a selling price, allowing them to profit from if the stock price declines. Scion is known for making big changes to its portfolio between quarters, but this was a particularly striking overhaul. At the end of March, it owned puts on Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, Nvidia, PDD, and Trip.com worth a notional $186 million, plus a roughly $13 million stake in Estee Lauder. Three months later, it held calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million, and a further six direct stakes valued at $56 million. It's worth underscoring that Burry may have rejigged his stock bets in recent weeks, and his disclosures may not paint a full picture of his investment strategy.

Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Ark Invest added 2,532,693 shares of BLSH in total across three of its actively managed ETF funds—ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF—as shares hit the market at the conclusion of the Bullish IPO. Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market today 8/13 pic.twitter.com/UStxQzSn36 — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) August 14, 2025 Bullish, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange and owns crypto media publication CoinDesk, offered shares in its firm for $37 as part of its IPO yesterday. But the stock quickly rose after trading began, reaching as high as $118 in the first afternoon of trading. The feat mirrors the explosive debut of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, which completed its IPO in June and quickly gained nearly 4x when it hit the market—outpacing IPOs from noted tech firms like Meta and Airbnb when they made their debuts. Ark Invest maintains exposure to Circle too, holding more than 4.2 million shares of CRCL across its ETFs, now valued at more than $626 million. It maintains exposure to crypto in other ways too, with combined holdings of more than $1.5 billion in shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD), both of which fall inside its top 10 holdings overall. It also holds around $17 million worth of shares in crypto exchange eToro (ETOR). Ark also has its own Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, which added $36.6 million in funds on Wednesday and holds more than $2 billion in assets according to data from Farside Investors. The success of Bullish’s IPO adds fuel to the accelerating trend of crypto firms seeking entwinement with public markets. Other exchanges like Gemini and OKX have signaled their interest in IPOs, with the former confidentially filing its intentions in June. Others, like FalconX and Kraken, are rumored to be in the mix as well. Shares of BLSH are up once more on Thursday, jumping nearly 10% to $74.60, bringing ARK’s holdings to nearly $189 million.

Title: Ethereum Could Surge To $15K As Institutions Pile In, Research Shows

According to Fundstrat research, Ether could climb much higher before the end of 2025, with price targets ranging from $10,000 to as high as $15,000. Reports show Ether jumped about 60% over the past 30 days and hit a four-year high near $4,770 in early trading, while other coverage put the token at $4,694 and noted a 78% surge over an eight-week stretch. Those moves have pushed Ether close to its all-time peak, and fund managers are taking notice. According to Fundstrat’s chief information officer Tom Lee and head of digital asset research Sean Farrell, institutional forces and new rules are key drivers. They point to stablecoin work and tokenized projects being built mostly on Ethereum, and they cite regulatory efforts such as the GENIUS Act and the SEC’s so-called Project Crypto as factors that could speed Wall Street’s move onto blockchain rails. Based on data, Ethereum holds a commanding 55% share of the $25 billion real-world asset tokenization sector, a stat that Fundstrat uses to argue for broader institutional adoption. Reports have disclosed large-scale corporate accumulation that several analysts say is taking supply off the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies has reportedly added about 1.2 million ETH since early July, leaving the company with roughly $5.5 billion worth of Ether on its books. Company stock (BMNR) has been volatile, with some coverage pointing to a 1,300% jump over a short period. Fundstrat and other observers say those kinds of corporate treasuries, combined with fresh ETF flows, could create a structural bid for ETH if the buying is sustained. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, described these positions as strategic and long-term, saying they remove “substantial liquidity” from trading pools. According to Fundstrat, Ether is outperforming Bitcoin this year. One set of figures put ETH’s year-to-date gain at 28% against Bitcoin’s 18%, while other reports more recently showed ETH up 41% YTD and Bitcoin up 30% YTD, with BTC trading near $121,000 in that snapshot. Based on reports, Fundstrat’s analysts view ETH as a major macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years if institutional and regulatory trends continue to push demand higher. Analysts caution that lofty targets will need sustained, large inflows to become reality. Watch for the pace and consistency of ETF flows, corporate treasury disclosures, and any regulatory moves around stablecoins and custody rules. There’s also a practical concern: big, concentrated buys can tighten markets quickly but may also reverse if sentiment shifts or liquidity needs change. According to analysis and public comments from Fundstrat, the bullish case for Ether is clear and backed by specific numbers: $10,000 to $15,000 targets, corporate treasuries holding millions of ETH, and rapid recent gains.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Adtech Stocks Tumble as AI, Increased Competition Weigh on Revenue

A turbulent Q2 earnings season has divided the adtech sector, as investors sell off shares of The Trade Desk, PubMatic, and Viant. Compared to the NASDAQ Composite, indicative of the broader market’s health, adtech stocks are trending down. Few firms, including AppLovin and Criteo, have been able to weather the selloff. Experts say the latest figures underscore the challenges facing adtech companies today; chief among them is competition with Big Tech titans who are increasingly entering their territory. The sector is now “operating in a market dominated by Google, Meta, and Amazon—three vertically integrated giants that collectively control the lion’s share of digital ad spend,” said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. “They not only run the largest ad networks but also own the platforms, data, and exchanges, allowing them to extract value from every part of the digital supply chain—often at the expense of publishers, advertisers and adtech companies.” Add in the complexities of navigating the AI boom—which is causing upheaval in how people search and stifling publisher traffic—and adtech companies are finding themselves in a new kind of pressure cooker. Demand-side platform The Trade Desk basked in Wall Street’s good graces throughout 2024 and into early 2025, as its share price soared and Q1 revenues achieved 26% year-over-year growth. But the tides have quickly turned: The stock plunged nearly 40% late last week on the back of the company’s Q2 earnings report, which showed slowing revenue growth and heightened competition from Big Tech firms like Amazon. CEO Jeff Green insisted on a call with investors that “Amazon is not a competitor.” Financial analysts expect a declining growth rate for The Trade Desk throughout the second half of the year. PubMatic, a leading sell-side platform, cited changes by a top demand-side partner in July for revenue hiccups. Its stock is down about 20% since earnings were reported Monday, and more than 30% over the last two weeks. The company’s CEO Rajeev Goel said on a call with investors that “a top DSP buyer shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently, impacting our revenue.” He added that PubMatic plans to “diversify ad spend away from legacy DSPs.” MNTN, the CTV darling that shot to prominence with the help of Ryan Reynolds and his creative agency Maximum Effort, saw shares tumble after reporting its first-ever earnings on the back of a May IPO. Only a few major firms have been able to weather the adtech selloff. Chief among them is AppLovin, which helps developers monetize mobile apps with ads. In June, AppLovin sold off its mobile apps business, which spurred increased investor confidence and netted it.$400 million in cash. The stock saw double-digit growth last week after it reported Q2 earnings that showed a 77% jump in revenue year-over-year, to $1.26 billion. AppLovin surpassed The Trade Desk last year to become the largest adtech company by market cap. Zeta Global, which positions itself as an AI-powered marketing cloud platform, has seen increased investor interest over the last two weeks. Criteo, a commerce-focused DSP, is also holding its own, even as rivals pose a growing threat. Meanwhile, the two leading ad verification vendors, Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify, were split. IAS’s stock spiked after an August 7 earnings report that included better-than-expected publisher performance, plus an adjusted EBITDA of $109.84 million. DoubleVerify, however, fared poorer. The firm beat revenue estimates, but missed on earnings per share. The adtech sector is entering the back half of 2025 with investor sentiment sharply divided, compounded by anxieties over AI and macroeconomic uncertainty in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs and steady inflation. Some analysts are confident about the industry as a whole, but see this selloff as a sign of splintering and increased competition. “Adtech companies are in a surprisingly solid place, by which I mean most businesses are running well enough with low double-digit growth on average, and mostly with growing profitability,” said Brian Wieser, principal and CEO of Madison and Wall. “If there’s a problem, it’s that there is no consolidator, and so the business seems likely to remain a fragmented, almost cottage industry, with a large number of mid-sized companies but few giants.” Kendra Barnett is Adweek's senior tech reporter.

In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog August 13, 2025 Selling on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce gives you the greatest amount of control over your own online store, marketing, and product positioning. But can you do more to increase your global reach and engage with new shoppers who wouldn’t have any other way to find your products? Yes, and selling products on multiple marketplaces, in addition to your ecommerce store, is the answer. These channels give you access to existing audiences so you can reach more customers in more places. The top multichannel marketplaces reach a wide range of people across the globe. Let’s go over some popular picks to understand how they can help you scale. You’re probably familiar with many of the best online marketplaces for multichannel selling — like Amazon and eBay. But there are several others with a comparable reach like Walmart, Etsy, and social media marketplaces such as TikTok Shop. There are also platforms that have a broad reach within a specific region, like OnBuy and Kogan. Here are some things to consider when choosing the right marketplaces for your business: Remember that you don’t have to commit to just one of these online sales channels. You can sell on multiple channels or give an online marketplace a trial run before migrating all of your products. Let’s take a closer look at the top multichannel marketplaces: Amazon has come a long way from its early days as an online bookseller. It’s now about as close as you can get to an everything-seller as it expands with brands like Whole Foods Market. Most of Amazon’s products come from other marketplace sellers, including ecommerce businesses that want to expand their reach to new audiences. Amazon’s long history gives it the advantage of time-tested features like Amazon Prime, its membership program for frequent customers. Some of the key advantages of selling on Amazon include: As an Amazon seller, you can also sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to have Amazon handle the shipping process for you. With FBA, you can offer two-day Amazon Prime shipping, which adds legitimacy to your products through Amazon’s implied endorsement. Selling products on Amazon comes with a few selling fees, depending on how you use the marketplace. Every seller pays them: Additional fees may apply for refunds, high-volume product listings, and services like FBA. This marketplace has a wide appeal and reach due to its broad global availability. Amazon ships to numerous countries through its AmazonGlobal program. When you partner with Amazon through FBA, your products become eligible for AmazonGlobal, helping you reach customers all over the world. And if you choose to serve the United States as part of those countries, you’ll enjoy the benefits of selling products through a reputable brand. Clarify Capital’s study on consumer trust found that people across generations considered Amazon their most trusted retail brand in 2023. Once you set up your account with Amazon, your team can integrate it with your WooCommerce store to manage your Amazon listings alongside your WooCommerce listings. Install the Amazon for WooCommerce extension to get started. eBay began as a place to sell used items through bidding competitions. Now, merchants can also sell new items through fixed price product listings, making it a great option for large and medium-sized online businesses. However, eBay is still most likely the best match for you if you sell pre-owned or refurbished items. Since eBay has been around for such a long time, it benefits from a more loyal group of buyers than something like Amazon. eBay itself notes that it has a base of “enthusiast buyers” who spend thousands of dollars a year on the marketplace. eBay is a true marketplace. It sells no products of its own, so your only competition comes from other sellers, not the parent company. Key advantages of selling on eBay include: Sellers on eBay pay two types of selling fees: If you choose to buy an annual eBay Store subscription, the cost is: These plans progressively offer more free listings and lower selling fees, allowing you to scale your eBay store alongside your business. According to eBay, its most dedicated online shoppers fall into four categories: Since eBay emphasizes that the second and third types of buyers drive the most growth, you’re likely better off sticking to a niche or using eBay’s tools to offer great deals. Sync your eBay and WooCommerce stores with the eBay Integration for WooCommerce extension. Walmart began as a brick-and-mortar retailer, not an ecommerce marketplace. But once it started selling online, Walmart quickly ramped up to compete against the biggest names. Walmart integrates marketplace products into its regular listings, so when someone searches for something on Walmart, marketplace items appear alongside products from Walmart. This can add both credibility and visibility to your catalog. Walmart Marketplace offers standard features like customer reviews, alongside more unique options, like: WFS works very much like Fulfillment by Amazon. You send your products to Walmart’s multiple warehouses. Then, when orders are placed, they pack and ship your products for you. Joining WFS also gives you the option to offer two-day shipping. A stricter qualification process is a good reason to consider Walmart, too. It only accepts sellers with a record of previous ecommerce success. This policy ensures that all its sellers are reputable, with quality offerings. Unlike Amazon or eBay, Walmart charges no fees for setup, listings, or subscriptions. It instead charges a fee per sale, which varies by product category. The range goes from 5% to 20%, but the majority of product fees are either 8% or 15%. Additional selling fees apply for those using WFS. WFS charges for each unit shipped, based on weight. Walmart Marketplace sellers benefit from Walmart’s reach as a major retailer in North America. According to Walmart’s research on the Marketplace audience, more than half of Americans who shop on Walmart.com buy from the marketplace. These customers shop in the following product categories most frequently: Shoppers on Walmart Marketplace also value low prices. Walmart’s research shows that 82% of these customers consider price an important factor in their Marketplace purchases. You’ll have the best luck with this channel if you sell lower-priced goods over luxury items. As a WooCommerce user, you can manage your Walmart product listings in your dashboard with the right extension for your region. American businesses can use the Walmart Integration for WooCommerce extension, while Canadian stores can use the Walmart Canada Integration extension. Etsy began as a platform for people to sell unique, handcrafted items, rather than mass-produced products. And for the most part, it retains that mission. For online sellers, Etsy is the place to sell one-of-a-kind items. Regardless of Etsy’s start as a place for individual artisans, medium-sized businesses and enterprises can also use its services if they fit into the right product categories. If you primarily sell craft supplies or vintage items, Etsy will help you find your people. And if those products are a subset of your inventory, you can sell them on Etsy and mention your WooCommerce store in accordance with Etsy policies. Etsy has some features similar to other platforms, such as apps, seller support, and the ability to customize your Etsy shop. In addition, Etsy’s seller benefits include: Rather than a monthly subscription, Etsy charges the following listing and transaction fees: Some stores may also need to pay a $15 one-time setup fee. Etsy’s audience is very distinct from the other top marketplaces online because it focuses on three product categories: handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. This niche focus means that Etsy shoppers are either looking for items they can’t find anywhere else or hoping to make their own unique creations. It’s a treasure hunt for the right find for a vintage collection or craft project. Unlike the last three marketplaces you learned about, Etsy serves a very specific audience, so some stores will find it to be an incredible opportunity to spur growth. WooCommerce also integrates with Etsy to make your life easier as an ecommerce seller. Add the Etsy for WooCommerce extension to get started. In recent years, social media giants like Meta and TikTok introduced in-platform stores like the Facebook Shop and TikTok Shop. These marketplaces work a little differently than the ones discussed so far. They connect directly to your social media profiles to create a seamless shopping experience for your followers. This makes them ideal if you have a particularly strong audience on social. Meta shops and TikTok Shop offer different experiences. While Facebook and Instagram focus mainly on your posts and profile, TikTok Shop also has a dedicated marketplace where users can search based on products and categories similar to other top marketplaces. Facebook and Instagram shops act like an extension of your current profiles. You can: Interactions with your store happen between followers and your profile rather than through a separate marketplace. In other words, Meta shops act like a proxy rather than an entirely different channel. Meanwhile, the TikTok Store offers similar features to Meta stores as well as a marketplace where customers can browse items independent of profiles. Sellers can also appear in TikTok’s Shop tab and join the Shop Mall program for extra visibility. TikTok users can search for the products they want in the Shop tab and see relevant listings regardless of the profiles they follow. Meta and TikTok also have different pricing models due to the nature of each platform. While you can use Facebook and Instagram shops for free, TikTok does charge seller fees. Currently, sellers who opt to direct customers to Instagram or Facebook’s checkout have to pay a payment processing fee of 2.9-3.49%. However, Meta plans on sunsetting in-platform checkout, so both shops will soon have no fees. Meanwhile, in exchange for its more robust features, TikTok charges the following fees for each sale: Just as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have different audiences, each store has a distinct audience as well. All three have a vast number of users, so it’s a matter of finding the right fit for your market. Here’s a general breakdown of each user base: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all have WooCommerce extensions to help you handle multichannel selling. Check out the Facebook for WooCommerce, Instagram Sync for WooCommerce, and TikTok for WooCommerce extensions. Marketplaces tailored to certain regions, such as OnBuy and Kogan, are perfect for geographic-based targeting. Medium-sized businesses and enterprises alike can tap into the potential of regional marketplaces if they have a good grasp on where their shoppers live. Otherwise, you may be better off sticking with more global platforms. The top feature of a regional marketplace isn’t something you’d list on a spec sheet. Instead, it’s the ability to attract people from the regions you serve. While features can vary, the best marketplaces do tend to offer standard features, such as order management and inventory tracking. Just like global brands, regional platforms take a variety of approaches to pricing. For example, OnBuy uses a plan-based pricing model without listing fees. Read a marketplace’s selling fees page carefully before you sign up. The reach of each regional marketplace varies. For example, Alibaba targets the entire Chinese ecommerce market, as well as other countries across Asia, while Kogan is specific to Australia and New Zealand. Check your ecommerce platform’s analytics to see where your shoppers come from and how much they overlap with a marketplace’s audience. WooCommerce provides extensions for two regional marketplaces — OnBuy and Kogan. Other platforms may offer their own integrations, or you can hire a developer to create a connection using the REST API. Since selling on popular marketplaces involves multiple channels, it requires a slightly different approach than using your ecommerce platform alone. Follow these tips to maximize your success: Most top marketplaces have a search function that is similar to those of major search engines. In order to provide the most relevant results, it attempts to match a customer’s search terms with the information included in listings. That means that your listings should include the words and phrases shoppers might use to find your products. That said, make sure to check your platform’s seller guides for any marketplace-specific tips. You can also use the basics of search engine optimization as a starting point. Most top marketplaces also offer ads and boosted listings that you can use for more visibility. Before getting started, find out the following about your specific platform: Many of the top marketplaces integrate with WooCommerce, allowing for: WooCommerce has a variety of extensions you can use to link your marketplace channels with your main store. You can do this by following these steps: With WooCommerce, you can scale your store across multiple sales channels. So, whether you want to add one marketplace at a time or jump in with several, WooCommerce has the features to support you. Add extensions as you need them to keep everything up to date and provide the best customer experience possible.With all that potential at your fingertips, what are you waiting for?

Title: Why the latest inflation data gives investors a reason to smile

Good morning. Ever considered investing in real estate? You might already have a big piece of what you need. "House hacking" is a new strategy homeowners are using to kick-start their rental portfolios. In today's big story, the latest inflation data gave investors a reason to feel upbeat about what's coming next. What's on deck: Markets: Why day traders' summer dominance could be hit with a September chill. Tech: Microsoft is dangling multimillion-dollar offers to poach Meta's AI talent. Business: Taylor Swift used to separate business from her love life. Not anymore. But first, the rally continues. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Not too hot, not too cold — this was just right. The latest inflation report struck a good balance, delivering a best-case scenario for the stock market. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. US stock futures are continuing the climb this morning. The consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, below economists' expectations of 2.8%. The figures may seem marginal, but for markets, this was the sweet spot. That's largely because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, BI's William Edwards writes. At the same time, the inflation reading was high enough to ease recession fears that had flared after the disappointing July jobs report, which included significant downward revisions to previous data. (The report rattled more than just economists — Trump promptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics director Erika McEntarfer after the data was released.) Meanwhile, the latest inflation report opens up more positive possibilities. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also now being priced in for cuts in October and December. For Trump, rate cuts can't come soon enough. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty' when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." Writing in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump said that he is also "considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed" over the "grossly incompetent" job he's done renovating the Federal Reserve. This is the latest twist in Trump's feud with the Fed Chair, which seems to remain in an uncomfortable phase. The markets, at least, may be entering a brighter one. 1. America's biggest bank is about to open its new headquarters. JPMorgan Chase's new 60-story skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue is full of high-end perks and amenities. The building includes a "state-of-the-art" gym — which the bank said employees will have to pay a membership fee to access — an Irish pub, AI tech systems, and more. Take a look. 2. A September showdown may be looming. Day traders outperformed professional money managers this summer, but their dominance might not last long. A historically seasonal pullback in retail trading and other headwinds threaten to upend the summer-long rally. 3. Trump's pick for Bureau of Labor Statistics chief suggested pausing US jobs reports. E.J. Antoni, Trump's nominee and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, floated the idea on Fox News Digital earlier this month, citing accuracy concerns. Economists and market strategists told BI that such a move would be damaging for investors and economic planners. 1. Microsoft has Meta AI talent in its sights. The software giant has a list of its most-wanted researchers and engineers from Meta and has already begun offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, documents viewed by BI's Ashley Stewart reveal. It's a step to compete with the eye-popping comp Microsoft's rivals are offering in the AI talent wars. 2. AI coding startups have an inference whale problem. Anthropic and Cursor are facing surging costs from a handful of heavy users, which is eating into their business models. As a result, they're introducing tiers or rate limits to what was formerly a basic fixed-price monthly subscription plan. 3. Baconator with a side of AI? Michael Chorey, the executive responsible for building out the AI automation for Wendy's drive-thru, which he says can take orders faster than a human in a headset, is leaving after five years. Chorey exclusively told BI that he is joining Presto, a tech company developing AI-first drive-thrus, which he believes is the next era of fast-food hospitality. 1. To solve the housing crisis, think outside the bounds. Outside the city bounds, that is. Ned Resnikoff argues that connecting cities, towns, and suburbs into large regional governances would make it easier and cheaper to buy a home in the US. Taxes from exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Connecticut, or Sausalito, California, would help support nearby cities. 2. Taylor Swift is in her boyfriend era. The pop star hard-launched the title of her newest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," in a teaser clip of her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast. It signals a shift in her marketing strategy, where she's putting her S.O. and her relationship front and center. 3. You've heard of quiet quitting, now get ready for quiet cracking. The latest threat to worker engagement is quiet cracking, in which people show up to work and do their jobs but still feel dissatisfied. Some of the warning signs can look like less extreme symptoms of burnout, EY's chief well-being officer told BI.

The trend of awarding massive equity grants to CEOs with already substantial ownership is under scrutiny. These packages, intended to incentivize performance, may instead encourage detrimental behaviors and prioritize personal gain over company success. Boards are urged to prioritize shareholder interests, resist excessive compensation demands, and seek leaders driven by passion for their work rather than solely by financial incentives.

Title: Trump's tariffs keep coming. Stock markets don't seem to care.
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/how-trump-tariffs-impact-stock-market-investors-rcna224521
Time Published: 2025-08-13T00:46:13Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At least for now, the U.S. stock market is on board with President Donald Trump’s increasingly aggressive use of executive power when it comes to tariffs. On Tuesday, major stock indexes hit fresh all-time highs as investors digested an inflation report that was mostly tamer than feared. While the details of the report suggest an overall mixed picture for the economy, it suggested fears of large immediate price increases from Trump’s tariffs may no longer be warranted. “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Last month’s heavier price increases were instead mainly found in service sectors like airfare and auto insurance rates. “The strength was concentrated to a few specific components and not broad based,” analysts with Citi said in a note. Tariffs are costs added to imports in the form of taxes. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. Efforts by firms to stockpile goods ahead of the tariffs’ impacts, as well as summer discounts and ongoing tariff deadline extensions by Trump, have insulated consumers from further effects. Tariffs continue to get negative reaction in surveys, with a mid-July Fox News poll showing Americans disapproved of Trump on tariffs by a 26-point margin. That was virtually unchanged from April, when Trump revealed shock new tariff levels in his Rose Garden “Liberation Day” speech announcing soaring new import duty levels. Stocks, meanwhile, continue to shrug them off. After Tuesday’s inflation report, traders increased the odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting in September. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Stocks’ recent behavior is in stark contrast to their dramatic spring sell-off in the wake of April’s “Liberation Day” speech. Investor reaction was so intense that Trump instituted a 90-day pause to reconsider what was set to be a cornerstone of his second administration’s economic policy. Today, Trump’s focus on tariffs hasn’t abated — but he has dialed back the more maximalist tariff levels he initially outlined. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. The performance of the stock market itself isn’t a full picture of the broader economy, however. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, at the end of July, just 9% of companies that make up the S&P 500 were at 52-week highs. The index’s movements are thus now heavily correlated with changes to the outlook of a handful of companies. If just one of them underperforms, it can take the entire market down with it. “When a handful of stocks dominate the market ... if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Small businesses remain especially vulnerable to the impact of tariffs, since they have less pricing power than larger firms. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the country’s largest small-business trade group, reported Tuesday that a shrinking share of respondents say they are profitable. “Increased costs are affecting everyone. I believe things will improve, but it will take time — six to 12 months. I just hope small businesses can hold on that long,” the NFIB quoted an unnamed fabricated metal product manufacturing firm in Michigan as saying in a July report. The U.S. economy isn’t out of the woods yet, said Kevin Gordon, director and senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab financial group. Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve. If it shows more pronounced signs of inflation than what Tuesday’s report suggested, stocks could quickly come down from their new highs. Barring that, conditions remain more benign than feared, he said, potentially setting the stage for further stock gains. “Weaker growth is not a concern at the moment,” he said. “Yes, there’s been some pullback, but it doesn’t mean we’re in any kind of recessionary scenario.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nuclear-powered AI could make Rolls Royce UK's most valuable firm, says boss
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8772d4jzgo
Time Published: 2025-08-12T23:01:03Z
Full Content:
Rolls-Royce's plan to power artificial intelligence (AI) with its nuclear reactors could make it the UK's most valuable company, its boss has said. The engineering firm has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments. AI has boomed in popularity since 2022, but the technology uses lots of energy, something which has raised practical and environmental concerns. Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. "There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong," he said. Mr Erginbilgic has overseen a ten-fold increase in Rolls-Royce's share price since taking over in January 2023. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. This is despite the fact that 50% of its shareholders and customers are US-based. "It's not in our plan," said Mr Erginbilgic, a Turkish energy industry veteran. "I don't agree with the idea you can only perform in the US. That's not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that." Rolls-Royce already supplies the reactors that have powered dozens of nuclear submarines. Mr Erginbilgic said the company has a massive advantage in the future market of bringing that technology on land in the form of SMRs. SMRs are not only smaller but quicker to build than traditional nuclear plants, with costs likely to come down as units are rolled out. He estimates that the world will need 400 SMRs by 2050. At a cost of up to $3bn (£2.2bn) each, that's another trillion dollar-plus market he wants and expects Rolls-Royce to dominate. The company has signed a deal to develop six SMRs for the Czech Republic and is developing three for the UK. But it remains an unproven technology. Mr Erginbilgic conceded he could not currently point to a working SMR example but said he was confident in its future potential. There are also concerns about the demands on water supplies from the data centre and SMR cooling systems. In response, companies including Google, Microsoft and Meta have signed deals to take energy from SMRs in the US when they are available. Rolls-Royce sees SMRs as key to its future, but its biggest business is aircraft engines. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. This market is worth $1.6tn - nine times that of the wide-bodied . Rolls-Royce is a bit player in a market that has powerful and successful leaders, and that rival Pratt and Witney lost $8bn trying and failing to break into. The market is dominated by CFM International – a joint venture between US-based GE Aerospace and French company Safran Aerospace Engines. Industry veterans told the BBC that market leaders can and will drop prices to airline customers long enough to see off a new assault on their market dominance. But Mr Erginbilgic said this is not just the biggest business opportunity for Rolls-Royce. Rather, it is "for industrial strategy... the single biggest opportunity for the UK for economic growth". "No other UK opportunity, I challenge, will match that," he said. Although BMW has owned the Rolls Royce car brand for nearly 30 years, the name of the company is still synonymous with British engineering excellence. But in the early part of this decade that shine had worn off. The company was heavily indebted, its profit margins were non-existent, and thousands of staff were being laid off. When Mr Erginbilgic took over in January 2023, he likened the company to "a burning platform". "Our cost of capital was 12%, our return was 4% so every time we invested we destroyed value," he said. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. So how did that happen? And is Mr Erginbilgic right to think that Rolls-Royce's roll is only just starting? The timing of his appointment was fortunate according to some industry veterans. Rolls-Royce's biggest business – supplying engines to commercial airlines – has rebounded strongly from the Covid pandemic. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Unions have not always been fans of Mr Erginbilgic's hard-charging approach. In October 2023, one of his first major move was cutting jobs, which drew criticism from Sharon Graham, the boss of the Unite union. "This announcement appears to be about appeasing the markets and its shareholders while ignoring its workers," she said at the time. However, overall global headcount has grown from 43,000 to 45,000 since 2023 and union sources say there is "grudging respect" for Mr Erginbilgic. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship". So does Mr Erginbilgic really believe that Rolls-Royce can be the UK's most valuable company – overtaking the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, and Shell? "We are now number five in the FTSE. I believe the growth potential we created in the company right now, in our existing business and our new businesses, actually yes – we have that potential." Rolls-Royce is undoubtedly a company with the wind at its back – and Tufan Erginbilgic certainly believes he has set the sails just right.

August 12, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company.

You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever.Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW), through certain of its officers, consistently touted the sustainability of Flywire’s revenue growth and financial condition, while downplaying the anticipated negative impacts of permit- and visa-related headwinds on the Company’s business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the strength and sustainability of Flywire’s revenue growth was overstated; (ii) the negative impact that permit and visa-related restrictions were having and were likely to have on Flywire’s business was understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

Kroger’s contract was at-will, and Ibotta failed to warn investors that a large client could cancel their contract with Ibotta without warning. Despite providing a detailed explanation of the terms of Ibotta’s contract with Walmart, there was not a single warning of the at-will nature of Kroger’s contract.

Please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/toon-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua Grabar at jgrabar@grabarlaw.com, or call 267-507-6085. WHY? On Augst 5, 2025, allegations made in a federal securities fraud class action complaint against Genius Brands, now known as Kartoon Studious Inc. (NYSE: TOON) partially survived a motion to dismiss. The underlying Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Kartoon Studious Inc. (AMEX: TOON) f/k/a Genius Brands International, Inc. (NASDAQ: GNUS) made false and/or misleading statements regarding: (i) Nickelodeon’s purported broadcast expansion of Genius’s Rainbow Rangers cartoon; (ii) subscription fees for the Kartoon Channel!; and (iii) the Company’s growth potential and overall prospects as a company. The Complaint further alleges that while the share price of Genius stock was artificially inflated due to these misstatements.On appeal from the Court’s order granting Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint (SAC), the Ninth Circuit found that Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that “Genius’s representations regarding PennyStocks in its May 7 SPA were misleading, and Genius’s statements regarding Rainbow Rangers, Disney/Netflix, and Stan Lee caused [Plaintiffs’] losses.” In re Genius Brands Int’l, Inc. Sec. Litig. (Genius II), 97 F.4th 1171, 1190 (9th Cir. 2024). The district court then determined that “Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and under § 20(a) of the Exchange Act are adequately alleged as to the Rainbow Rangers statements.” WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Kartoon Studious Inc.

Title: Price And Promo; Reddit Ditches The Wayback Machine

Pricing Power If a marketer has a buck to spend, do they knock $1 off the price or spend $1 more on media? Sometimes, price can itself be promotional marketing. One famous example includes Costco hotdogs. The CEO notoriously (semi-jokingly, we hope) said he would be dead before raising the hot dog prices from $1.50 without sacrificing sales. Beverage brand AriZona Iced Tea requires essentially zero advertising. A can has cost 99 cents for 30 years. Price and promotions are intrinsically related. And one of Amazon’s innovations in ad tech is that its bidding logic and product rankings incorporate both price and promotion (two of the four Ps of marketing, for any marketing majors out there). Which brings us to Warby Parker. The glasses brand and data-driven digital-native bellwether has offered a baseline $95 pair of glasses for 17 years. And they’re fighting like heck to keep it that way, The Wall Street Journal reports. Relatedly, the company hasn’t had a CMO for more than a year. Investors are pushing for higher prices. Similar glasses have gone up everywhere else. But the company doesn’t want to touch its signature “P,” price. “We may have to increase that price at some point, but we’re going to do everything possible for as long as possible to not” raise prices, co-CEO Nate Blumenthal told investors last week. An Archive of Whose Own? Reddit is no longer playing nice with the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, The Verge reports. The Wayback Machine is a forensic library of online URLs. So users can see exactly how those pages looked on certain dates. It’s useful for accessing websites that have been edited, censored or shut down. But all that content makes the Wayback Machine a common target for AI scraper bots. As a result, the Wayback Machine will now only be granted access to Reddit’s homepage. More granular access would provide a backdoor for LLMs to scrape Reddit data without a licensing agreement. Reddit has taken a hard line against AI scrapers, but it said last year that its bot-blocking efforts would not affect “good faith actors” like the Internet Archive. Of course, that was before AI licensing deals became a double-digit part of Reddit’s revenue, according to an estimate COO Jen Wong shared with Adweek earlier this year. (Based on their latest earnings call, it sounds like ad sales make up the rest.) Anyway, if third-party archiving efforts keep getting caught up in the fight over AI scrapers, we might have to rely on publishers and platforms themselves to keep their own records. Which, as any journalist who’s seen all their clips disappear overnight can tell you, is not a great long-term solution. Read The Script AI scrapers are reshaping the web in another way: They skip over JavaScript. For one thing, all the LLM operators aside from Google (like Claude, ChatGPT and Perplexity) don’t index JavaScript, as confirmed and elaborated in a blog post by SEO consultant Glenn Gabe. That sounds innocuous, but it’s a major wrench in the online publishing machine – and a huge miss for the non-Google AI chatbots. JavaScript is how most visual or interactive elements are rendered online. This New York Times article on persuasive delusions based on ChatGPT convos, for instance, is heavy on JavaScript elements. Without JavaScript, key context goes missing. Google’s AI bot knows JavaScript because the Google Search crawler knows JavaScript. The net result is, in the new world of AI-based SEO, sites must package their site text, metadata and displays in basic ways that are most digestible to LLM bots. It’s sad that AI chatbots are missing so many of the fun videos that were hits on the early web. Also, notably, ads often render in JavaScript. Google’s AI bot might thus incorporate the ads that appear on a page into its model – ads appear in the Wayback Machine, too, for example – whereas other chatbots don’t see ads on pages, only empty white boxes. But Wait! There’s More! With hundreds of millions of hours of streaming content to sift through, Olyzon.tv uses AI to classify and target CTV inventory. [AdMonsters] Wall Street investors are thinking about downgrading The Trade Desk’s stock due to the platform’s future growth being threatened by Amazon and AI.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Can The Trade Desk turn walled gardens’ retreat into open web gains?

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → If you’re reading this, you’ll likely have seen at least some of the latest financial results posted by the ad tech sector’s coterie of publicly listed companies, with AppLovin and The Trade Desk leading the pack in earnings (see below). Both companies, talismans of independent ad tech, saw their stock prices dip in early hours after issuing Q2 earnings — despite reporting a 77% and 19% annual increase in revenues, respectively.In The Trade Desk’s case, this included an immediate 30% plunge. The declines were tied to “the narrative,” with analysts deeming guidance remarks underwhelming. AppLovin retained its lead as top earner, with The Trade Desk, now in the S&P 500, nearing $700 million in revenue for the period. Indies eye gains from Google’s troubles and walled garden retreat A common thread across several earnings was the potential to benefit from Google’s mounting legal troubles with the Justice Department. The week began with news that OpenX is seeking compensation for Google’s anticompetitive actions as part of an ongoing ad tech antitrust case. Meanwhile, Magnite leadership expressed similar concerns during their Q2 earnings call (see above). In a Q&A after The Trade Desk’s August 7 earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said these trials are creating opportunity for independent ad tech as marketers grow wary of Google and other Big Tech platforms. Green noted “the supply-side demand imbalance” favoring “the open internet” over walled gardens like Amazon, Google, and Meta. “Consumers spend more of their time in the premium open internet than they do inside of walled gardens,” he said, adding that walled gardens have an inherent conflict of interest. “I believe TTD and the open internet have a bigger TAM than Facebook has… Our goal is to buy the entire open Internet objectively for buyers.” He also claimed, “As Google and Facebook have largely abandoned the open internet, The Trade Desk is the largest source of third-party demand for many publishers around the world.” Profit trumps transparency in adland and finance While investors punished perceived weak growth forecasts, they appeared forgiving of structural flaws in the ecosystem. Several high-profile criticisms of the cohort barely registered in analyst questioning across calls. The last 12 months have been turbulent for the sector, with short-sellers targeting multiple companies, including AppLovin and Zeta Global, causing stock price volatility. Yet Q2 results suggest advertisers largely ignored these claims. In Q1, AppLovin’s stock fell 20% after Muddy Waters alleged unethical data use, prompting a rare off-calendar defense from leadership. In Q2 disclosures, executives emphasized plans to drive advertiser growth via AI and greater adoption of its self-serve platform, reducing reliance on sales or product teams. It also aims to expand internationally so its customer base is evenly split between the U.S. and global markets. With a Q4 rollout, AppLovin is targeting SMBs, expanding beyond in-app into broader web and e-commerce. CEO Adam Foroughi said testing has brought in hundreds of advertisers, “The new type of platform that comes to our platform is extremely incremental to our business… We expect that will increase the advertiser count quite quickly, and also allow us to go through live examples of advertisers coming in self-service [and then] all the way to scale on our product.” Despite revenues of $1.2 billion, up 77% year-over-year and beating expectations, AppLovin’s stock still fell 7% after the announcement — a sign of investors’ counterintuitive moves. Earlier in the week, Zeta Global, which faced short-seller reports late last year, posted similarly strong results. Earnings rose 35% year-over-year to exceed $300 million, signaling client confidence despite prior allegations. Analysts focused more on Zeta’s competitive positioning, particularly with agencies under pressure to develop high-margin software tools. Also under scrutiny in 2025 have been ad measurement and brand safety giants DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. Both reported Q2 growth: DoubleVerify at $198 million, up 21% year-over-year, and IAS at $149.2 million, up 16%. These gains came despite reports highlighting brand safety shortcomings. In March, Adalytics alleged DoubleVerify and IAS failed to block ads to declared bots despite advertisers paying for pre-bid bot filtration, and routinely allowed general invalid traffic, implying advertisers were misled about protection levels. This followed an earlier report claiming both allowed ads on sites with child abuse content, triggering a class-action suit against DoubleVerify. The company has responded with its own defamation case against Adalytics. Despite the controversy, revenue momentum and advertiser contracts appear to be sustaining both companies. On DoubleVerify’s August 5 call, leadership highlighted rising activity in social and CTV — up 14% and 45% annually, respectively — while fielding questions about relevance as the open web wanes. CEO Mark Zargorski, discussing AI’s rise, said, “So many of the AI solutions don’t include a lot of transparency on what’s going on… That’s part of our role, to drive transparency and open up that black box a bit.” He added that value remains strong among customers on Meta and other platforms using AI tools “without a lot of transparency or clarity on how we’re getting there.” LiveRamp also posted results for the quarter ending June 30 — “Q1 2026” in its reporting. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Guidance for the next quarter was $197 million, with a full-year forecast of up to $818 million. “Google went from organizing the world’s information to stealing it, taking a sledgehammer to the implied contract the open web has relied on for so long.” –Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO, in a blog post explaining how his company has removed 40,000 pages of its financial content from the reach of Google and other AI search engines. Instead, this content will now be exclusively available to logged-in WalletHub users. Future of TV Briefing: 5 reasons CTV’s ROI comes up short for advertisers Despite the hype, CTV is still not the miracle media channel for advertisers. The reason? It’s still impossible to justify the costs, according to UM Worldwide chief investment officer Marcy Greenberger. ‘You can nullify the effects of what looks like change’: OpenX CEO John Gentry on its legal quarrel with Google After filing legal papers citing Google’s alleged misdeeds to subvert and dominate the online display ad ecosystem, notably in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same jurisdiction where the biggest company in advertising is doing battle with the Justice Department, seeking damages, and adding to calls for a structural remedy. Omnicom’s Samardzija To Join Stagwell In The Fall After Digiday first covered news of a pending leadership shakeup at Omnicom Media Group, with the pending exit of Annalect CEO Slavi Samardzija, it has subsequently been announced that he will join independent media agency Stagwell, with precise details of his role yet to be confirmed. The State of Digital, 2025, by LUMA Partners The macroeconomic environment improved throughout 2024, but uncertainty over the tariff policies to be enacted by the current U.S. administration caused market instability. Despite this, digital ad spend has rebounded, and AI is now considered a fundamental requirement for marketers, with the amount of mergers and acquisitions in the space experiencing a notable uptick in the opening quarter of 2025. More Like No Yield: A New Book Explores How Google Soaked Up The Web’s Ad Profits AdExchanger’s James Hercher sums up Ari Paparo’s book, “Yield: how Google bought, built and bullied its way to advertising dominance.” It features a host of familiar names such as Stephanie Layser, Jana Meron, Brian O’Kelley, Michael Barrett, Michael Rubenstein and many other industry leaders play prominent roles, all of whom help chronicle how Google ingested DoubleClick, and later went on to cross almost every tier of the market with a series of rollouts such as Project Poirot, Project Bell, Project Bernanke, Project Jedi Blue, Project Liberty, Project Wolf and Project Centillion. This Ad Tech OG’s AI-Powered Analytics Startup Just Raised $9M In Series A Funding Newton Research, a company led by ex-Data Plus Math exec John Hoctor has raised $9 million two years after it was founded, taking its total funding to $14 million. Contributors to the latest Series A round include Greycroft and Bessemer Partners, along with S4S Ventures, Aperiam Ventures, plus LiveRamp’s investment arm. Fortunes are fluctuating, despite earnings increases across the board… time for consolidation? The adoption of AI tools like agentic offerings and smarts in new hires to power more of media agency workings continues to pick up pace.

Title: Stripe Is Building A Blockchain: Can Openness Survive Branded Rails?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/christiancatalini/2025/08/11/stripe-is-building-a-blockchain-can-openness-survive-branded-rails/
Time Published: 2025-08-12T00:20:00Z
Full Content:
ByChristian Catalini ByChristian Catalini, Contributor. Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune’s reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe’s crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe’s Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We’ve seen this tension before in the early internet’s open web versus walled gardens. In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today’s tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it’s increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto’s reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn’t pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it’s true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they’re trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it’s difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China’s introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta’s initiative. Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others’ efforts—into action. Even Circle’s Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that’s been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they’re profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions. This trade‑off is broader than a user’s decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That’s exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today’s internet giants did. So what’s the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it’s safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That’s where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they’ll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech’s offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Advertisement August 11, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Barry Dudley of Green Square dissects the fledgling talks between S4 Capital and MSQ Partners, exploring strategic fit, the market forces driving the potential deal and what it could mean for Sir Martin Sorrell’s “new-age” marketing group after a turbulent few years. Sir Martin Sorrell founded S4 Capital in 2018 after leaving WPP S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s ‘new-age’ digital marketing group, has confirmed that it is in very preliminary deal talks with MSQ Partners, the creative and technology agency network that is majority-owned by US private equity firm One Equity Partners (OEP). The potential deal – which S4 says would be structured as an acquisition of MSQ by S4 Capital rather than a takeover of S4 – comes after a bruising period for the group. S4’s share price has fallen more than 90% from its peak only a few years ago. The current market capitalization sits at around £140m, a fraction of the multibillion pound valuation it once enjoyed. I’ve heard rumors and seen reports of other interested parties in the past, including the likes of Stagwell, New Mountain Capital and Accenture. I suspect Sir Martin has had many conversations come at him, or indeed he has sought them. Probably even more are incoming right now. S4 Capital was founded in 2018 after Sorrell’s high-profile exit from WPP. Built on aggressive M&A, it focused on digital content production, programmatic advertising and data-driven marketing through acquisitions such as MediaMonks and MightyHive. Its client base reads like a tech-sector who’s-who: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta to name just a few. However, that narrow tech focus has been a double-edged sword. When the sector tightened budgets and many reallocated spend towards AI investments, S4’s revenues took a hit – compounded by accounting missteps, economic headwinds and rising interest rates. MSQ Partners, on the other hand, offers a broader spread of clients – more than 250, including Unilever, Haleon, Lego, P&G and Booking.com – across consumer goods, healthcare, financial services and B2B. It operates through a decentralized network of specialist agencies spanning advertising, PR, design, digital, and tech. Since being acquired by OEP in 2023, MSQ has invested in integrated, creative-plus-tech delivery models. We recently advised Precious Media, a connected commerce digital agency, on its sale to MSQ. So how could they fit: Complementary client bases – S4 is over-indexed to tech; MSQ brings balance through FMCG, healthcare, and finance. Capability cross-sell – MSQ’s creative brand-building could bolster S4’s digital execution; S4’s programmatic and data expertise could sharpen MSQ’s digital performance offering. Geographic scale – S4’s US and APAC strength could mesh with MSQ’s European roots, giving a broader footprint without heavy duplication. AI positioning – Both have leaned into AI narratives, but a combined group could pool their R&D resources. Advertisement The marketing services sector is undergoing its biggest structural shift since the holding-company era of the 80s and 90s. AI is reshaping creative workflows, media buying and data analytics. Clients are consolidating their agency rosters, looking for faster, integrated delivery. The network groups have been re-engineering their own businesses to face this new way of working, with WPP recently merging its media offer under one brand. All are focussed on, and investing in, AI to help them deliver across media, creative and processes. But these are big legacy firms… and big ships can find it notoriously difficult to change course quickly. This has created fertile ground for private equity–backed roll-ups and mergers of complementary mid-scale networks. We’ve seen a plethora of PE firms coming into the market and appetite isn’t abating. For OEP, combining MSQ with S4 could create another top-tier independent rival, not only to snap at the heels of the mega groups, but also some of the smaller challenger brands and the other PE-backed indies. It could also give MSQ more muscle in terms of its own future expansion, both geographically and in terms of capability infills it may need. Advertisement Will OEP take it off the stock market? I suspect it will, not least because it removes that historical peak – which was arguably a significant over-valuation – which will otherwise be a benchmark that continues to be referenced under the current listing. That said, maintaining the listing could open up other options in terms of financing future acquisitions. And where will Sir Martin end up if this goes through? His voting control and personal stake mean no deal happens without him seeing a clear path for himself. Wherever things go, he looks set for another defining chapter in his career.

Title: Is the A.I. Boom Turning Into an A.I. Bubble?

When Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with Donald Trump in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I. Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a research paper entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold. The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures. Having written extensively on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, FOMO, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of FOMO and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder. Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and ICE, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows. Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble. It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations. The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “AI Action Plan,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to cut interest rates next month, which could give another boost to the markets. There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble. All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close. The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent. ♦

Title: Artificial workforce: Microsoft’s layoffs are a canary in the coal mine for white-collar jobs

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. In July, Microsoft announced it was laying off 9,000 employees, bringing the total job cuts this year to over 15,000. This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services. It can dramatically increase productivity, personalize services and bridge gaps in human capacity. But only if we invest in the right infrastructure, skills and safety nets. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech How the AI revolution plays out isn’t a given; it will be shaped by the choices that we make as CEOs , policymakers and leaders. As a tech and development leader, I believe we need a radically new playbook to navigate this transformation. Re-imagine education and skilling: We must move beyond traditional degree-based learning and embrace lifelong, flexible and tech-enabled skill development. Foundational digital literacy, data fluency and adaptability must be priorities. Support mass entrepreneurship: If formal employment is shrinking due to automation, we must create the conditions for millions to become self-employed or run micro-enterprises. In the 21st century, entrepreneurship is not a career choice—it is a life skill. Governments and the private sector should invest in promoting entrepreneurship, small businesses and strengthening local entrepreneurship ecosystems. Build an inclusive AI strategy: AI should not be designed only for the rich. India must lead the world in AI applications that serve small farmers, frontline health workers, teachers, small business owners and informal workers, ensuring that the revolution lifts the many, not just the few. Foster humane corporate cultures: The way layoffs are being handled—often without notice or severance—risks breaking trust in organizations. Companies must find a more responsible and compassionate approach to workforce transition. Culture, after all, is a competitive advantage. Create public policy for resilience: Governments must track labour market shifts in real time and build social safety nets that are fit for the AI era, whether that means unemployment insurance, portable benefits or incentives for reskilling. Also Read: Siddharth Pai: Don’t be naive, Agentic AI won’t eliminate agency costs When coal miners took canaries into their mines, it wasn’t because they didn’t expect danger. It was to act quickly when signs appeared. Microsoft’s layoffs are that sign. They tell us that AI is not something for the distant future. It’s already here, and is changing how work takes place, who gets employed and what skills matter. We simply cannot afford to sleepwalk into this future. We must act now—with clarity, courage and care. This is not just a tech issue. It is a social, economic and moral challenge that will define our generation. Let’s not waste the warning. Let’s build a future where AI empowers and uplifts, rather than excludes and displaces.

Title: OpenAI to give employees ‘special’ million-dollar bonuses amid AI talent wars

OpenAI has announced a ‘special one-time award’ to its AI researchers and engineers across several departments, including applied engineering, scaling, and safety. The bonuses were announced a day before the Microsoft-backed AI startup unveiled GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large language model (LLM). More than 1,000 OpenAI employees are eligible for the bonus, according to a report by The Verge. The ChatGPT-maker is currently valued at $300 billion. While the exact bonus amounts are not known, it will likely depend on the role and seniority of qualified employees, with the highest million-dollar payouts reportedly going to OpenAI’s prized AI researchers, who already draw salaries worth millions of dollars every year. The engineers, on the other hand, will reportedly receive bonuses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars on average, the report said. However, these bonuses are not likely to be paid out at once. Instead, it will be disbursed over the next two years with qualified workers having the option to receive the money in OpenAI stock, cash, or both. “As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we have been looking at comp for our technical teams given the movement in the market,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted as saying by The Verge. “We very much intend to keep increasing comp as we keep doing better and better as a company. But we wanted to be transparent about this one since it’s a new thing for us,” Altman added. This is reportedly the first time that OpenAI has offered bonuses to such a large number of employees, about one-third of the company’s full workforce. The move comes against the backdrop of a rapidly intensifying war for AI talent. Several companies have poached OpenAI researchers with lucrative offers, and Meta has led the charge. Since the one-time special bonus does not apply to all employees, OpenAI risks losing more workers, who may feel overlooked, to other companies. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s research officer, has previously likened Meta’s aggressive poaching spree to a home invasion. Shengjia Zhao, one of the creators of ChatGPT, was recently named as the chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Besides Meta, Elon Musk’s xAI has also reportedly been making aggressive offers to lure away OpenAI’s top talent. Thinking Machines, an AI rival lab started by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, also comprises several of OpenAI’s technical staff. Meanwhile, OpenAI also reportedly plans to allow current and former employees to cash out with millions by selling their vested stock to investors. However, Altman has reportedly said that employees might be able to sell at a much higher share price than the current $274 per share at a higher valuation of $500 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.
