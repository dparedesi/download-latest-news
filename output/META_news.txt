Title: Chinese state-linked accounts hyped DeepSeek AI launch ahead of US stock rout, Graphika says

For premium support please call: For premium support please call: By Katie Paul and Stephen Nellis NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese state-linked social media accounts amplified narratives celebrating the launch of Chinese startup DeepSeek's AI models last week, days before the news tanked U.S. tech stocks, according to online analysis firm Graphika. The accounts involved in the effort, including those of Chinese diplomats, embassies and state media, amplified media coverage of the launch and promoted the idea that DeepSeek challenged U.S. dominance in the AI sector, New York-based Graphika said in a report it provided to Reuters on Thursday. The messaging was rolled out on platforms such as Elon Musk's X and Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram, as well as Chinese services Toutiao and Weibo, Graphika said. "This activity shows how China is able to quickly mobilize a range of actors that seed and amplify online narratives casting Beijing as surpassing the U.S. in critical areas of geopolitical competition, including the race to develop and deploy the most advanced AI technologies," Graphika Chief Intelligence Officer Jack Stubbs told Reuters. "We've consistently seen overt and covert Chinese state-linked actors among the first movers in leveraging AI to scale their operations in the information environment." Graphika said it also found a video featuring pro-China, anti-Western content on a YouTube channel whose activity resembled that of Shadow Play, a coordinated influence campaign involving at least 30 YouTube channels that was first identified by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2023. YouTube owner Alphabet, Meta, X and the Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the report. Graphika said it found a small spike in discussion about DeepSeek's advancements in relation to OpenAI's ChatGPT on X immediately after DeepSeek released its models on Jan. 20, followed by a much larger uptick that started on Friday and continued to build over the weekend. By Monday, DeepSeek's free AI assistant had overtaken U.S. rival ChatGPT in downloads from Apple's app store and global investors dumped U.S. tech stocks, wiping $593 billion off chipmaker Nvidia's market value in a record one-day loss for any company on Wall Street. Nvidia declined to comment on the Graphika report. DeepSeek's researchers claim to have developed aspects of their AI model at a far lower cost than U.S. rivals, sparking worries that U.S. companies that have plowed tens of billions of dollars into AI data centers could face a price war with China. Shares of Microsoft, a major investor in OpenAI that operates data centers on behalf of the ChatGPT creator, slid earlier this week when it disclosed slower cloud revenue growth than Wall Street expected while it continued to plow billions into capital expenditures. Microsoft and Meta have vowed to continue deep investments in AI for the foreseeable future. DeepSeek's rise to prominence was celebrated in China as a sign that the nation was beating back Washington's attempts to contain China's tech industry with curbs on technology exports. In the U.S., DeepSeek's accomplishments sparked accusations that it had improperly accessed technology from OpenAI and other leaders, though the allegations remain unproved. The U.S. Commerce Department is looking into whether DeepSeek has been using U.S. chips that are not allowed to be shipped to China, a person familiar with the matter said.

Title: How Democrats alienated Big Tech — and why it might not matter

When news breaks, you need to understand what matters — and what to do about it. At Vox, our mission to help you make sense of the world has never been more vital. But we can’t do it on our own. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Democrats have paid a political price for taking on Silicon Valley — but not a very expensive one. by Eric Levitz In January 2017, Sergey Brin rallied beside progressive activists at San Francisco International Airport to protest Donald Trump’s travel ban. Eight years later, the Google co-founder sat with right-wing nationalists at Trump’s second inauguration. Brin is far from the only tech mogul who has (apparently) warmed to Trump in recent years. Mark Zuckerberg once bankrolled liberal causes. Now, the Facebook founder dines with America’s favorite insurrectionist at Mar-a-Lago. In 2016, Marc Andreessen argued that Hillary Clinton was the “obvious choice” for president, and that any proposal to choke off immigration “makes me sick to my stomach.” Last year, Andreessen endorsed Trump. And, of course, Elon Musk has gone from being an Obama-supporting climate hawk to quite possibly the single most influential advocate for — and patron of — far-right politics in the United States. The lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat — and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz. Silicon Valley’s apparent rightward shift was already causing consternation in blue America last year. But Democrats’ outrage and anxiety over the red-pilling of Silicon Valley has only increased since Inauguration Day — when Brin, Zuckerberg, Musk, Jeff Bezos, Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook all sat with Trump’s camp in the Capitol Rotunda. Some Democrats view Big Tech’s rightward lurch as a political crisis, one brought on by their own party’s policy mistakes. In this account, Democrats needlessly alienated a powerful industry by embracing an anti-corporate economic agenda that is both politically costly and substantively misguided. Others in the party, meanwhile, insist that the Biden administration’s attempts to tame Big Tech’s power were both good politics and good policy. In their telling, voters hate corporate monopolies and love antitrust enforcement. And the extraordinary wealth and power of large tech companies constitute a threat to democratic government — a reality that Silicon Valley’s present chumminess with Trump only underscores. From this vantage, the tech industry’s interests and the general public’s were always irreconcilable. And as Silicon Valley grew wealthier, it was bound to gravitate toward America’s more pro-business party. The Biden administration’s error, therefore, was not doing too much to antagonize Big Tech, but too little. This debate collapses together several distinct questions. Some of these are ideological — such as whether the Biden administration’s approach to antitrust enforcement was worthwhile on the merits. Today though, I want to focus on two factual questions at the center of the intra-Democratic dispute over Big Tech: I think the answers to both these questions are more complicated than either progressive or pro-business Democrats allow. To understand why Silicon Valley has moved right in recent years, it’s helpful to consider what had previously tethered the industry to the center-left. Many in the tech world argue that Silicon Valley and the Democratic Party were long bound by an implicit “deal”: Democrats would support the development of new technology, celebrate entrepreneurs, and take a light touch approach to regulating the digital sphere — in exchange for tech moguls backing socially liberal causes, progressive taxation, incremental expansions of the welfare state, philanthropies, and Democratic candidates. This was a pretty good bargain for the typical tech founder — since it effectively entailed the Democratic Party embracing nearly all of their preferences. Survey data on the views of Silicon Valley moguls is limited. But a 2017 study of tech entrepreneurs’ politics found that they were left-leaning on almost all issues — including taxation and redistribution — but quite right-wing on questions of government regulation and labor unions. This distinct ideological profile has been dubbed “liberal-tarian.” Given that Democrats have always been the party more supportive of regulating industry and promoting organized labor, the party’s alliance with tech was long fraught with some tension. But in recent years, both sides began souring on their supposed contract for a variety of reasons. But three were especially significant: When an industry is enjoying explosive growth, it has less incentive to align with the right. Democrats might nibble into its profits with their relatively high taxes, or inch its compliance costs with their greater regulatory scrutiny. But when your sector is awash in cheap financing and soaring revenues, the price of allying with a left-of-center party can look negligible. As Andreessen put the point to the New York Times earlier this month, back in the days of Clinton and Obama, “the tax rates didn’t really matter because when an internet company worked, it grew so fast and got so valuable that if you worked another three years, say, you’d make another 10 X. Another 5 percent higher tax rate washed out in the numbers.” Silicon Valley enjoyed such favorable conditions for much of the 2010s. But the tech boom faded during Biden’s tenure. In 2022, rising interest rates started diverting capital away from the tech sector: With safe assets now offering an attractive guaranteed return, investors grew more reluctant to funnel cash into risky ones. Stock market valuations fell and layoffs spread. At the same time, as Noah Smith notes, tech investors and executives started running up against structural constraints on profit-making. Many venture capitalists looked at Google and Facebook’s success in cornering and dominating their respective markets, and bet that they could establish similarly monopolistic businesses in other corners of digital commerce. But by 2022, they’d discovered that achieving such market dominance was harder than they’d thought. Meanwhile, social media companies struggled to combat the inherently finite nature of human attention: Once you’ve lured roughly 5 billion humans onto social media — and turned a hefty percentage of them into addicts — there’s only so much screen time left to monetize. In this context, we would expect tech moguls who’d been only lightly committed to the “liberal” part of liberal-tarianism to start heeding their own narrow material interests. After all, it was a similar mix of rising interest rates, inflation, and slowing profitability that helped prompt corporate America’s right turn in the 1970s. To be sure, the tech industry’s fortunes have rebounded since 2022, thanks in no small part to the AI boom. But the experience of a capital crunch and profit squeeze — however temporary — seems to have made a lasting impression on many in tech, whose political contributions began shifting (modestly) toward Republicans in 2022. For the reasons above, it wouldn’t have been surprising for the tech industry to have drifted toward Republicans over the past four years, even if Democratic policy remained as friendly to tech as had it been under Barack Obama. In reality, the Biden administration took a much more adversarial stance than its predecessors. Biden’s Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department collectively brought antitrust cases against Amazon, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft. This blitzkrieg of aggressive antitrust enforcement naturally irritated Silicon Valley’s giants. Perhaps less predictably, it also antagonized smaller tech firms and startups. In theory, one might expect “little tech” would want the government to curb the market power of their gargantuan competitors. In practice, however, many startup founders and investors aspire to either grow their own firms into behemoths, or failing that, get bought up by a larger company. By chilling merger activity, the Biden administration effectively blocked many startups’ “plan B,” while choking off a reliable source of returns for venture capitalists. VCs and startups also took exception to the Biden Securities and Exchange Commission’s vigorous regulation of cryptocurrency, as well as the administration’s executive order on AI safety. In November 2023, a contingent of startup founders and investors denounced the latter, arguing that the order’s reporting requirements put small AI firms at a competitive disadvantage, as they could less comfortably shoulder regulatory compliance costs than their larger rivals. Finally, Biden proposed a new tax on the unrealized capital gains of Americans with more than $100 million in wealth. This would mean that when a megamillionaire investor’s stock portfolio or real estate holdings gained $5 million in value, they would need to pay a tax on that amount, even if they did not sell those assets. Tax policy wonks like this idea. But super-rich tech investors very much do not. And when Kamala Harris announced her support for Biden’s plan last summer, Silicon Valley’s venture capitalists had a conniption. Super-rich tech moguls care about making money. But they are often at least as covetous of social status. Past a certain point, accumulating more wealth has little practical impact on your living standards (or those of your children, or your children’s children). But a person’s appetite for greater prestige tends to be less exhaustible than their desire for beach homes, Porsches, or private jets. Thus, if Democrats had spent the past decade exalting tech investors and founders, it’s possible that the party’s increasingly adversarial policies would have caused less rancor in Silicon Valley. But Democrats became increasingly disillusioned with the tech industry over the course of the 2010s. And this culminated in a Democratic administration that undermined tech billionaires’ sense of self-importance. “At the core level, both Barack Obama and the modal Democrat thought the average Silicon Valley company was really good and cool in 2009,” Marc Aidinoff, a historian and policy adviser in both the Obama and Biden administrations, told me. “Obama would go to Silicon Valley and have dinner with the CEOs and call them champions of change. What these people really wanted from the president was the sense that they were loved.” But by 2021, things had changed, according to Aidinoff. “Joe Biden distrusts these people, thinks they are hurting Americans, and has the sense that they aren’t actually making much of real value,” he said. The Democrats’ disenchantment with tech wasn’t attributable to Biden’s personal skepticism of Silicon Valley alone. After the financial crisis, the party’s progressive wing grew more influential. And its ascent increased the salience of both inequality and labor issues in Democratic politics. For a party increasingly concerned with wealth concentration and workers’ rights, tech giants that generated vast fortunes off “winner-take-all” markets — while, in many cases, committing labor violations or undermining traditional employment — did not look like engines of progress. As importantly, the notion that social media platforms promoted democracy and social reform fell into disrepute. In the wake of Obama’s election and the Arab Spring — both of which were widely credited to novel media technologies — many liberals bought into the idea that Facebook and Twitter would abet a more egalitarian politics. But authoritarian regimes proved adept at restricting online speech. And if social media’s potential to facilitate rightwing extremism wasn’t clear to liberals before 2016, it was apparent to them afterward. Following Trump’s victory, many Democrats blamed their party’s defeat on Facebook’s dissemination of “fake news.” Around the same time, research suggesting that social media could have adverse mental health effects started to accumulate. All this — combined with tech platforms’ adverse impact on traditional journalism — led the mainstream media to view Silicon Valley more critically. Between 2012 and 2019, the New York Times’ coverage of Facebook turned sharply negative, according to one prominent data analysis. Add in Silicon Valley’s growing enthusiasm for crypto — a technology that appeared to be good for little beyond scams and speculation — and it isn’t hard to see why Democrats soured on Big Tech. The party’s newfound skepticism of the industry didn’t just translate into greater regulatory scrutiny, but also, a withholding of both praise and access. According to some in tech, the sector’s leading lights felt themselves shunned and slighted by the Biden White House. “I think the fundamental problem, and I heard this from many, was that former President Biden was unwilling to meet with tech CEOs and entrepreneurs,” the billionaire investor Mark Cuban told me. “It was that simple.” One former Biden official echoed this assessment, saying that tech companies “couldn’t get meetings with a lot of the key regulators. Certainly [FTC commissioner] Lina [Khan] wouldn’t meet with people — she liked to say, ‘We’re enforcement, you can’t really meet with us.’” Andreessen recently reminisced that Bill Clinton’s Democratic Party had “celebrated” and “loved” tech companies. Biden’s Democratic Party, by contrast, often refused Andreessen’s ilk the time of day. It’s clear then that Silicon Valley’s rightward turn was precipitated, at least in part, by a change in the Democratic Party’s attitudes and policies toward the tech industry. And there’s reason to think that the party’s anti-tech turn is politically costly on net. Were other tech billionaires to emulate Musk’s political giving — or other social media companies to imitate X’s boosting of right-wing content — the damage to Democrats could be considerable. And the Trump administration’s manifest openness to trading political power for financial support makes this a live possibility, especially if Democrats promise to reprise the Biden administration’s policies toward the industry. Meanwhile, it’s far from clear that aggressively regulating Silicon Valley can gain Democrats meaningful support elsewhere. This is not because voters oppose that general goal: In fact, in a 2024 Pew Research poll, a slight majority expressed support for increasing regulation of the tech industry, while a supermajority said that social media has had a “mostly negative” effect on the United States. The problem is that voters have ambivalent feelings about Big Tech writ large, and do not consider regulating the companies a priority. When Gallup asked Americans what their country’s most important problem was this month, only 1 percent named “corporate corruption” while 0 percent picked “technology.” In a post-election survey from Morning Consult and the Chamber of Progress (a trade group of companies allied with the Democratic Party), voters were presented with a list of 12 issues, and asked to name the two that were most important to their vote. Only 2 percent of respondents picked “regulating technology companies” as one of their priorities, making it the single least prioritized objective on the list (by contrast, 49 percent selected “controlling inflation and strengthening the economy”). Meanwhile, in YouGov’s polling, Amazon’s approval rating sits at 74 percent, Google’s at 70 percent, Apple’s at 69 percent, and Facebook at 59 percent. Given all this, it’s plausible that Democrats have more to lose than gain politically from taking on Big Tech. Yet it’s also true that the political costs of the party’s anti-tech turn have been routinely overstated. In truth, Silicon Valley’s rightward shift — while real — has been remarkably modest, whether measured in votes or donations. In 2020, Biden won Santa Clara County, which includes much of Silicon Valley, by 48 points. Four years later, he won it by 40 points. There’s some evidence that tech workers and executives became more likely to donate to Republicans during the Biden era. But 83 percent of Amazon employees’ donations to federal candidates went to Democrats in 2024; for Meta, that figure was 91.5 percent; for Apple, it was 95 percent. At the megadonor level, the story is a bit more complicated. Trump received more money from tech donors who spent over $1 million on the 2024 race than Harris did — but that’s mostly thanks to Musk’s prodigious giving. Musk spent $242.6 million on the 2024 election, nearly five times as much as Silicon Valley’s second-largest political spender, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, a Democrat. And yet, it’s hard to attribute Musk’s political evolution to recent changes in Democratic policy. The Tesla CEO appears to have been undergoing a process of online radicalization even before Biden took office (in March 2020, Musk allegedly bet the writer Sam Harris $1 million that there would be fewer than 35,000 cases of Covid-19 in the United States, a conviction that seems symptomatic of his immersion in right-wing social media). If we deem Musk a special case and put him to the side, then Democrats retained their advantage with large tech donors in 2024: Combined, all other tech megadonors spent $30.6 million on Trump, and $120.9 million on Harris, according to an analysis from The Guardian. In any case, money was not the Democrats’ problem in 2024. The party and its allied groups outraised the GOP by $1.1 billion during last year’s campaign. To be sure, many Silicon Valley billionaires waited until after Election Day to cozy up to Trump, so their newfound support for the GOP would not be captured by this data. But those who only started currying Trump’s favor once he secured the presidency are likely motivated less by antipathy for Democratic policy than awareness of Republican corruption: Trump has made it quite clear that his friends can expect favorable treatment by his government while his foes can anticipate the opposite. “A number of people in tech led with vinegar during Trump’s first term and learned that it was better with Trump to lead with honey,” Adam Kovacevich, a former Google executive and chair of the Chamber of Progress, told me. “It’s not so much that they expect a lot, but they really don’t want their companies to be hurt by Trump. If your competitors are building a close relationship with Trump, you don’t want them to screw you.” All of which is to say: The Democrats have paid a price for their crusade against Big Tech, but not a prohibitively expensive one. None of this settles the debate over whether Democrats were right to take a more adversarial posture toward the tech industry under Biden. Moderate Democrats can look at this pattern of facts and conclude that Biden’s agenda alienated a powerful industry and did little to increase their party’s popular support, all while discouraging growth and innovation. Progressives, meanwhile, can counter that Democrats just proved they can take on concentrated corporate power and still retain an overwhelming financial advantage over the GOP — and thus, the party has no excuse not to prioritize the interests of ordinary Americans over those of tech billionaires. Ultimately though, the important disagreement here is the substantive one. If Democrats can ingratiate themselves to tech billionaires in ways that have little substantive cost — such as giving them face time or rhetorical encouragement — they might be well-advised to do so. But the party as of yet faces no imperative to abandon policies that benefit the general public, for the sake of appeasing Silicon Valley titans.

Title: Apple's iPhone sales during the holiday season slipped despite a highly anticipated AI rollout

Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company’s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company’s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses. The iPhone’s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year’s October-December period wasn’t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device’s AI features didn’t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn’t available in many markets outside the U.S. The countries still awaiting Apple’s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground. Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion. Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple’s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year. Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone’s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple’s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp. The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple’s other products may not boost the company’s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June. The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple’s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple’s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out. The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible. Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn’t been investing as heavily in AI – one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek’s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum. Apple’s services division remained the company’s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google’s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple on Thursday disclosed its iPhone sales dipped slightly during the holiday-season quarter, signaling a sluggish start to the trendsetting company’s effort to catch up to the rest of Big Tech in the race to bring artificial intelligence to the masses. The iPhone’s roughly 1% drop in revenue from the previous year’s October-December period wasn’t entirely unexpected, given the first software update enabling the device’s AI features didn’t arrive until just before Halloween, and the technology still isn’t available in many markets outside the U.S. The countries still awaiting Apple’s AI suite include China, a key market where the company continued to lose ground. Apple also was only able to eke out a modest revenue gain across its entire business, although the results came in ahead of the analyst projections that guide investors. The Cupertino, California, company earned $36.3 billion, or $2.40 per share, a 7% increase from the previous year. Revenue edged up from the previous year by 4% to $124.3 billion. Those numbers included iPhone revenue of $69.1 billion. In China, Apple’s total revenue registered $18.5 billion, an 11% decrease from the previous year. Part of that erosion in China reflected the iPhone’s shrinking market share in that country, where homegrown companies have been making more headway. Apple’s iPhone year-over year shipments in China declined nearly 10% in the most recent quarter, while native companies Huawei and Xiaomi posted year-over-year increase of more than 20%, according to the research firm International Data Corp. The holiday-season results served to confirm bringing AI to the iPhone and Apple’s other products may not boost the company’s recently lackluster growth as much as investors initially thought it might after CEO Tim Cook unveiled the technology before a rapt crowd last June. The anticipation that an AI-infused iPhone would prod hordes of consumers to ditch their current devices and splurge on an upgrade is the main reason Apple’s stock price surged by 30% last year. But the sinking realization that an uptick in demand may take longer than expected has caused Apple’s shares to backtrack by 5% during the first month of the new year. The stock slipped slightly in extended trading after the numbers came out. The concerns hovering around Apple's weakening iPhone sales come against broader worries about whether AI will be as lucrative for U.S. tech companies as once envisioned after Chinese startup DeepSeek released a version of the technology that was built at a far lower cost than had been previously thought possible. Unlike tech peers such as Microsoft, Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc. and Facebook corporate parent Meta Platforms, Apple hasn’t been investing as heavily in AI – one of the reasons it has been an industry laggard. But that restraint could work to its advantage if DeepSeek’s early breakthroughs in driving down AI costs gains momentum. Apple’s services division remained the company’s biggest moneymaker outside the iPhone, with revenue of $26.3 billion in the past quarter, a 14% increase from the previous year. Although the services division has been thriving for years, it generates more than $20 billion annually by locking in Google as the automatic search engine on the iPhone and other products. That deal is now under threat of being banned as part of the proposed punishment for Google’s search engine being declared an illegal monopoly. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Apple Reports Record $124.3 Billion Revenue on Strong Holiday Sales

The tech giant offset a modest iPhone sales dip with strong results from Europe, subscriptions and iCloud Apple reported the company’s best quarterly sales ever on Thursday, with the tech giant pointing to a strong holiday performance leading to $124.3 billion in Q1 revenue. The company posted the big quarter despite declining sales in China and a minor dip in iPhone revenue. Apple offset its sales drop in China with an 11.4% year-over-year increase in European sales, as well as 14% annual growth from Apple’s Services sector, which includes Apple TV+, Apple Music, and iCloud storage. Those gains also helped Apple weather flat sales from its Wearables division, which accounts for Apple Watch, headphones, and its Vision Pro virtual reality headsets. Apple CEO Tim Cook, in a statement accompanying earnings, announced Apple Intelligence — the company’s artificial intelligence program designed to help users with messages, notifications, and other features — would “be available in even more languages this April,” without providing further details. Here are the top-line numbers from Apple’s first quarter, which represents its October through December performance: Revenues: $124.3 billion, a 4% increase from the year prior. Apple’s Q1 sales narrowly topped analyst estimates from Zack’s Investment Research of $124 billion. The Q1 performance also topped Apple’s previous record of $123.9 billion in sales during the holiday quarter of 2021. Apple’s sales in China, notably, dropped 11% year-over-year to $18.5 billion. Cook explained the dip on the call by saying it was due to a “change in channel inventory,” or products that are in the supply chain but have not been sold yet. He also said China is the “most competitive market in the world” and that, moving forward, he believes recent government stimulus packages will help some of Apple’s products in the next quarter. The company made up for it in Europe, its second biggest market, where Apple had $33.9 billion in Q1 revenue — an 11.4% year-over-year increase. Net income: $36.3 billion, up 7.1% from last year’s $33.9 billion. Earnings Per Share: Apple’s diluted earnings per share of $2.4o were better than Zack’s estimates of $2.36 EPS. iPhone Sales: Revenue from Apple’s linchpin device declined 0.8% annually to $69.1 billion. Apple brought in nearly $70 billion from iPhone sales a year ago. Services: Apple’s wide-ranging Services sector accounted for $26.3 billion in sales, compared to the $23.1 billion brought in a year ago. As is usually the case, Apple did not mention how its streaming service, Apple TV+, was performing in its quarterly report, though on its earnings call Cook did express enthusiasm about several of its upcoming shows. This was the best quarter ever for Services sales. Cook was in Washington, D.C. last week for President Trump’s inauguration, where he was joined by a number of other Big Tech CEOs, including X owner Elon Musk, Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Cook’s appearance came after he personally donated $1 million towards Trump’s inauguration fund. Heading into Thursday, Apple’s stock price had increased a modest 3.5% since the start of October. The company’s holiday quarter coincided with the October launch of Apple Intelligence; the rollout was met with tepid reviews, and has led to questions from some analysts about Apple’s future in a crowded AI space. Apple is the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap of $3.57 trillion. Microsoft, with a valuation of $3.09 trillion, is the next closest company. Cook, on the Q1 earnings call on Thursday afternoon, said Apple now had 2.35 billion active devices worldwide — yet another company record. The 64-year-old executive also took a moment to extend his condolences to those affected by the “devastating wildfires that impacted the Los Angeles area.” There was not much mentioned about Apple’s entertainment push, beyond Cook mentioning the recent return of “Severance” and the upcoming “Formula One” film starring Brad Pitt.

Title: Microsoft, AWS, and Cerebras launch DeepSeek R1 model

Nabugu - stock.adobe.com Enterprises that want to test DeepSeek-R1, the Chinese reasoning model that caused a tsunami in the tech industry, can get it from cloud providers AWS and Microsoft, the online platform GitHub and hardware maker Cerebras Systems. The tech companies made the model from Hangzhou, China-based AI startup DeepSeek available this week, just days after it rocked the tech industry by casting doubt on the high cost of running AI in the United States. The model is comparable to OpenAI's o1 but requires a fraction of the GPU power, according to its developers. "DeepSeek-R1 is certainly having its viral moment now," said Gartner analyst Arun Chandrasekaran. Chandrasekaran said he expects many companies to offer DeepSeek-R1, including variants for specific industries and cloud, data center and edge deployments. Model providers will likely differentiate themselves from competitors by offering better performance for the price through infrastructure innovations, Chandrasekaran said. They will also provide security and privacy layers and guarantees around legal indemnification. "Having said that, in a few months, we may not remember R1 as much as we do today," Chandrasekaran said. "There is now a race to build models with better efficiencies, and we will see more such models from large cloud providers in the U.S., China, as well as from AI research labs in the world." Microsoft made DeepSeek-R1 available on GitHub and the model catalog on Azure AI Foundry. The Foundry offers developers tools to experiment with, iterate on and integrate the model's capabilities into workflows. It also provides security and model evaluation tools. AWS offers its version of DeepSeek on its SageMaker platform for building, training and deploying custom models. AWS customers can train DeepSeek on SageMaker using the Hugging Face open source platform. "We expect to see many more models like this -- both large and small, proprietary and open source -- excel at different tasks," AWS said in an emailed statement. Cerebras Systems introduced AI hardware running a 70-billion-parameter DeepSeek-R1 powered by the company's WSE-2 processor. The preview technology is contained in Cerebras' flagship CS-3 system, a unit that fits within a standard data center rack. Cerebras claims DeepSeek-R1-70B is faster, more accurate, and less expensive than OpenAI's o1 reasoning model. Cerebras trained its model on the same data used to train Llama 3.3 using knowledge distillation, a technique that transfers data from a large, complex model to a smaller, more efficient one. The price of the DeepSeek system will be similar to Cerebras hardware running Llama 3.3 70B. Cerebras has developed a framework called Cerebras Planning and Optimization to enhance the reasoning abilities of Llama 3.3 Cerebras declined to provide pricing details or say how many of its WSE-2 processors are used to run Llama and DeepSeek. Hagay Lupesko, vice president of software engineering at Cerebras, said the company has received many queries from U.S. companies interested in its DeepSeek model. "We have a pretty long list of preview customers who are in line for access to the model," Lupesko said. He declined to name any organizations but said many were in the consumer industry and interested in using the model for application development. Cerebras also used the Llama 3.3 weights to train its version of DeepSeek. Weights are the numerical patterns critical to a model's ability to recognize patterns and make predictions based on input data. That means its DeepSeek model doesn't have the output restrictions of the original Chinese model, which, for example, does not answer queries about the Chinese leader, President Xi Jinping. DeepSeek developed and released its model to the open source community. However, some components are inaccessible, and the company did not release the data used to train the model. Hugging Face and Llama creator Meta are attempting to reverse engineer the technology. The company's researchers shook the tech world after they published a research paper demonstrating how they trained the model on significantly less-powerful Nvidia GPUs than the ones used for Open AI's reasoning model o1, yet achieved similar results. The disclosure raised serious questions about the efficiency of U.S.-made models and whether spending tens of billions of dollars on Nvidia's top chips was necessary. On Monday, Nvidia lost $589 billion in market value due to the research paper and release of DeepSeek's R1 model. The company's stock has regained some, though not all, of its losses.

Title: AI #101: The Shallow End

The avalanche of DeepSeek news continues. We are not yet spending more than a few hours at a time in the singularity, where news happens faster than it can be processed. But it’s close, and I’ve had to not follow a bunch of other non-AI things that are also happening, at least not well enough to offer any insights. So this week we’re going to consider China, DeepSeek and r1 fully split off from everything else, and we’ll cover everything related to DeepSeek, including the policy responses to the situation, tomorrow instead. This is everything else in AI from the past week. Some of it almost feels like it is from another time, so long ago. I’m afraid you’re going to need to get used to that feeling. Also, I went on Odd Lots to discuss DeepSeek, where I was and truly hope to again be The Perfect Guest. Joe Weisenthal finally tries out Google Flash Deep Thinking, is impressed. AI tutors beat out active learning classrooms in a Harvard study by a good margin, for classes like physics and economics. Koratkar gives Operator a shot at a makeshift level similar to Montezuma’s Revenge. Nate Silver estimates his productivity is up 5% from LLMs so far, and warns others that they ignore LLMs at their peril, both politically and personally. Fix all your transcript errors. LLMs are good at transforming text into less text, but yet good at transforming less text into more text. Note that this rule applies to English but doesn’t apply to code. Write your code for AI comprehension, not human readability. Vik: increasingly finding myself designing software for AI comprehension over human readability. e.g. giant files, duplicated code, a lot more verification tests. Now i just need to convince the agent to stop deleting failing tests… James Darpinian: IMO these usually increase human readability as well, contra “best practices.” Vik: agree, makes it so you don’t have to keep the entire codebase in your head. can go in, understand what’s going on, implement your change and get out without spending too much time doing research or worrying you’ve broken something That’s even more true when the humans are using the AIs to read the code. A negative review of Devin, the AI SWE, essentially saying that in practice it isn’t yet good enough to be used over tools like Cursor. The company reached out in the replies thanking them for the feedback and offering to explore more with them, which is a good sign for the future, but it seems clear we aren’t ‘there’ yet. I predict Paul Graham is wrong about this if we stay in ‘economic normal.’ It seems like exactly the kind of combination of inception, attempt at vibe control and failure to realize the future will be unevenly distributed we often see in VC-style circles, on top of the tech simply not being there yet anyway. Paul Graham: Prediction: From now on we’ll rarely hear the phrase “writer’s block.” 99% of the people experiencing it will give in after a few days and have AI write them a first draft. And the 1% who are too proud to use AI are probably also too proud to use a phrase like “writer’s block.” Certainly this won’t be true ‘from now on.’ No, r1 is not ready to solve writer’s block, it cannot create first drafts for you if you don’t know what to write on your own in a way that solves most such problems. AI will of course get better at writing, but I predict it will be a while up the ‘tech tree’ before it solves this problem. And even if it does, it’s going to be a while beyond that before 99% of people with writer’s block even know they have this option, let alone that they are willing to take it. And even if that happens, the 1% will be outright proud to say they have writer’s block. It means they don’t use AI! Indeed, seriously, don’t do this: Fear Buck: Kai Cenat’s $70k AI humanoid robot just tried running away from the AMP house because it kept getting kicked and bullied by Kai, Agent & Fanum Liv Boeree: Yeah don’t do this, because even if something doesn’t have “feelings” it is just teaching you and your followers that it’s okay to act out their worst instincts Education is where I see the strongest disagreements about AI impact, in the sense that those who generally find AI useful see it as the ultimate tool for learning things that will unleash the world’s knowledge and revolutionize education, and then there are others who see things another way. PoliMath: AI use is damaging high school and college education enormously in ways that are going to be extremely obvious in 5 years but at that point you can only watch. I don’t understand this position. Yes, you can use AI to get around your assignments if that’s what you want to do and the system keeps giving you those assignments. Or you can actually try to learn something. If you don’t take that option, I don’t believe you that you would have been learning something before. Your periodic reminder that the main way to not get utility is to not realize to do so: Nate Silver: Thinking ChatGPT is useless is midwit. It’s a magic box that answers any question you ask it from levels ranging from modestly coherent to extremely proficient. If you haven’t bothered to figure it out to derive some utility out of it then you’re just being lazy tbh. Even better than realizing you can use ChatGPT, of course, is using a mix of Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, r1, o1, o1 pro and yes, occasionally GPT-4o. Others make statements like this when others show them some mundane utility: Joe Weisenthal: Suppose I have some conference call transcripts, and I want to see what the CEOs said about the labor market. I could read through all of them. Or I can ask AI to retrieve the relevant comments and then confirm that they are actually real. Latter is much more efficient. Hotel Echo: Large Language Models: for when Ctrl-F is just too much like hard work. Yes. It is much more efficient. Control-F sucks, it has tons of ‘hallucinations’ in the sense of false positives and also false negatives. It is not a good means to parse a report. We use it because it used to be all we have. Also some people still don’t do random queries? And some people don’t even get why someone else would want to do that? Joe Weisenthal: I wrote about how easily and quickly I was able to switch from using ChatGPT to using DeepSeek for my random day-to-day AI queries Faze Adorno: Who the f*** has random day-to-day AI queries? “I’m gonna use this technology that just makes up information at anywhere between a 5 and 25 percent clip for my everyday information! I’m so smart!” Joe Weisenthal: Me. I do. I literally just typed that. LA Banker (so say we all): Whoever doesn’t = ngmi. Here are two competing theories. Dan Schwartz: I categorize this by “People who regularly do things they are not experts in” versus “People with a regular, time-honed routine for their work and personal life.” People I know in the latter group genuinely do not have much use for AI! Jorbs: This is fascinating to me because, in my (limited) attempts to utilize LLMs, they have essentially only been useful in areas where I have significant enough knowledge to tell when the output is inaccurate. For example, as someone who took a couple of quarters of computer science but is not a regular coder, LLMs are not good enough to be useful for coding for me. They output a lot of material, but it is as much work to parse it and determine what needs fixing as it is to do it from scratch myself. I resonate but only partially agree with both answers. When doing the things we normally do, you largely do them the way you normally do them. People keep asking if I use LLMs for writing, and no, when writing directly I very much don’t and find all the ‘help me write’ functionality useless – but it’s invaluable for many steps of the process that puts me into position to write, or to help develop and evaluate the ideas that the writing is about. Whereas I am perhaps the perfect person to get my coding accelerated by AI. I’m often good enough to figure out when it is telling me bullshit, and totally not good enough to generate the answers on my own in reasonable time, and also automates stuff that would take a long time, so I get the trifecta. On the question of detecting whether the AI is talking bullshit, it’s a known risk of course, but I think that risk is greatly overblown – this used to happen a lot more than it does now, and we forget how other sources have this risk too, and you can develop good habits about knowing which places are more likely to be bullshit versus not even if you don’t know the underlying area, and when there’s enough value to check versus when you’re fine to take its word for it. A few times a month I will have to make corrections that are not simple typos. A few times I’ve had to rework or discard entire posts because the error was central. I could minimize it somewhat more but mostly it’s an accepted price of doing business the way I do, the timing doesn’t usually allow for hiring a fact checker or true editor, and I try to fix things right away when it happens. It is very rare for the source of that error to be ‘the AI told me something and I believed it, but the AI was lying.’ It’s almost always either I was confused about or misread something, or a human source got it wrong or was lying, or there was more to a question than I’d realized from reading what others said. This reaction below is seriously is like having met an especially irresponsible thirteen year old once, and now thinking that no human could ever hold down a job. And yet, here we often still are. Patrick McKenzie (last week): You wouldn’t think that people would default to believing something ridiculous which can be disproved by typing into a publicly accessible computer program for twenty seconds. Many people do not have an epistemic strategy which includes twenty seconds of experimentation. Dave Karsten: Amplifying: I routinely have conversations at DC house parties with very successful people who say that they tried chatGPT _right when it came out_, found it not that impressive, and haven’t tried it again since then, and have based their opinion on AI on that initial experience. Ahrenbach: What’s the ratio of “AI is all hype” vs “We need to beat China in this technology”? More the former than the latter in house parties, but that’s partially because more of my defense/natsec people I tend to see at happy hours. (This is a meaningful social distinction in DC life). Broadly, the average non-natsec DC person is more likely to think it’s either a) all hype or b) if not hype, AI-generated slop with an intentional product plan where, “how do we kill art” is literally on a powerpoint slide. But overton window is starting to shift. It is now two weeks later, and the overton window has indeed shifted a bit. There’s a lot more ‘beat China’ all of a sudden, for obvious reasons. But compared to what’s actually happening, the DC folks still absolutely think this is all hype. Claude API now allows the command ‘citations’ to be enabled, causing it to process whatever documents you share with it, and then it will cite the documents in its response. Cute, I guess. Curious lack of shipping over at Anthropic recently. o3-mini is coming. It’s a good model, sir. Benedikt Stroebl: Update on HAL! We just added o3-mini to the Cybench leaderboard. o3-mini takes the lead with ~26% accuracy, outperforming both Claude 3.5 Sonnet and o1-preview (both at 20%) It’s hard to see, but note the cost column. Claude Sonnet 3.5 costs $12.90, o1-mini cost $28.47, o1-preview cost $117.89 and o3-mini cost $80.21 if it costs the same per token as o1-mini (actual pricing not yet set). So it’s using a lot more tokens. OpenAI’s canvas now works with o1 and can render HTML and React. Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking got an upgrade last week. The 1M token context window opens up interesting possibilities if the rest is good enough, and it’s wicked cheap compared even to r1, and it too has CoT visible. Andrew Curran says it’s amazing, but that opinion reached me via DeepMind amplifying him. Dan Mac: everyone comparing deepseek-r1 to o1 and forgetting about Gemini 2 Flash Thinking which is better than r1 on every cost and performance metric Peter Wildeford: The weird thing about Deepseek is that it exists in a continuum – it is neither the cheapest reasoning model (that’s Gemini 2 Flash Thinking) nor the best reasoning model (o1-pro, probably o3-pro when that’s out) I disagree with the quoted tweet – I don’t think Gemini 2 Flash Thinking is actually better than r1 on every cost and performance metric. But I also have not seen anything that convinces me that Deepseek is truly some outlier that US labs can’t also easily do. That is a dramatic drop in price, and dramatic gain in context length. r1 is open, which has its advantages, but we are definitely not giving Flash Thinking its fair trial. The thing about cost is, yes this is an 80%+ discount, but off of a very tiny number. Unless you are scaling this thing up quite a lot, or you are repeatedly using the entire 1M context window (7.5 cents a pop!) and mostly even then, who cares? Cost is essentially zero versus cost of your time. Google Deep Research rolling out on Android, for those who hate websites. Google continues to lean into gloating about its dominance in LMSys Arena. It’s cool and all but at this point it’s not a great look, regardless of how good their models are. Need practical advice? Tyler Cowen gives highly Tyler Cowen-shaped practical advice for how to deal with the age of AI on a personal level. If you believe broadly in Cowen’s vision of what the future looks like, then these implications seem reasonable. If you think that things will go a lot farther and faster than he does, they’re still interesting, but you’d reach different core conclusions. Judah offers a thread of different programmer reactions to LLMs. Are there not enough GPUs to take all the jobs? David Holz says since we only make 5 million GPUs per year and we have 8 billion humans, it’ll be a while even if each GPU can run a virtual human. There are plenty of obvious ways to squeeze out more, there’s no reason each worker needs its own GPU indefinitely as capabilities and efficiency increase and the GPUs get better, and also as Holz notices production will accelerate. In a world where we have demand for this level of compute, this might buy us a few years, but they’ll get there. Epoch paper from Matthew Barnett warns that AGI could drive wages below subsistence level. That’s a more precise framing than ‘mass unemployment,’ as the question isn’t if there is employment for humans the question is at what wage level, although at some point humans really are annoying enough to use that they’re worth nothing. Matthew Barnett: In the short term, it may turn out to be much easier to accumulate AGIs than traditional physical capital, making physical capital the scarce factor that limits productivity and pushes wages downward. Yet, there is also a reasonable chance that technological progress could counteract this effect by making labor more productive, allowing wages to remain stable or even rise. Over the long run, however, the pace of technological progress is likely to slow down, making it increasingly difficult for wages to remain high. At that point, the key constraints are likely to be fundamental resources like land and energy—essential inputs that cannot be expanded through investment. This makes it highly plausible that human wages will fall below subsistence level in the long run. Informed by these arguments, I would guess that there is roughly a 1 in 3 chance that human wages will crash below subsistence level within 20 years, and a 2 in 3 chance that wages will fall below subsistence level within the next 100 years. I consider it rather obvious that if AGI can fully substitute for actual all human labor, then wages will drop a lot, likely below subsistence, once we scale up the number of AGIs, even if we otherwise have ‘economic normal.’ That doesn’t answer the objection that human labor might retain some places where AGI can’t properly substitute, either because jobs are protected, or humans are inherently preferred for those jobs, or AGI can’t do some jobs well perhaps due to physical constraints. If that’s true, then to the extent it remains true some jobs persist, although you have to worry about too many people chasing too few jobs crashing the wage on those remaining jobs. And to the extent we do retain jobs this way, they are driven by human consumption and status needs, which means that those jobs will not cause us to ‘export’ to AIs by default except insofar as they resell the results back to us. The main body of this paper gets weird. It argues that technological advancement, while ongoing, can protect human wages, and I get why the equations here say that but it does not actually make any sense if you think it through here. Then it talks about technological advancement stopping as we hit physical limits, while still considering that world being in ‘economic normal’ and also involves physical humans in their current form. That’s pretty weird as a baseline scenario, or something to be paying close attention to now. It also isn’t a situation where it’s weird to think about ‘jobs’ or ‘wages’ for ‘humans’ as a concern in this way. I do appreciate the emphasis that the comparative advantage and lump of labor fallacy arguments prove a wage greater than zero is likely, but not that it is meaningfully different from zero before various costs, or is above subsistence. Richard Ngo has a thread criticizing the post, that includes (among other things) stronger versions of these objections. A lot of this seems based on his expectation that humans retain political power in such futures, and essentially use that status to collect rents in the form of artificially high wages. The extent and ways in which this differs from a UBI or a government jobs program is an interesting question. Tyler Cowen offers the take that future unemployment will be (mostly) voluntary unemployment, in the sense that there will be highly unpleasant jobs people don’t want to do (here be an electrician living on a remote site doing 12 hour shifts) that pay well. And yeah, if you’re willing and able to do things people hate doing and give up your life otherwise to do it, that will help you stay gainfully employed at a good price level for longer, as it always has. I mean, yeah. And even ‘normal’ electricians make good money, because no one wants to do it. But it’s so odd to talk about future employment opportunities without reference to AI – unemployment might stay ‘voluntary’ but the wage you’re passing up might well get a lot worse quickly. Also, it seems like electrician is a very good business to be in right now? IFP is hiring a lead for their lobbying on America’s AI leadership, applications close February 21, there’s a bounty so tell them I sent you. I agree with IFP and think they’re great on almost every issue aside from AI. We’ve had our differences on AI policy though, so I talked to them about it. I was satisfied that they plan on doing net positive things, but if you’re considering the job you should of course verify this for yourself. New review of open problems in mechanistic interpretability. ByteDance Duabao-1.5-Po, which matches GPT-5o benchmarks at $0.11/$0.275. As with Kimi k1.5 last week, maybe it’s good, but I await evidence of this beyond benchmarks. So far, I haven’t heard anything more. Alibaba introduces Qwen 2.5-1M, with the 1M standing for a one million token context length they say processes faster now, technical report here. Again, if it’s worth a damn, I expect people to tell me, and if you’re seeing this it means no one did that. Feedly, the RSS feed I use, tells me it is now offering AI actions. I haven’t tried them because I couldn’t think of any reason I would want to, and Teortaxes is skeptical. Scott Alexander is looking for a major news outlet to print an editorial from an ex-OpenAI employee who has been featured in NYT, you can email him at scott@slatestarcodex.com if you’re interested or know someone who is. Reid Hoffman launches Manas AI, a ‘full stack AI company setting out to shift drug discovery from a decade-long process to one that takes a few years.’ Reid’s aggressive unjustified dismissals of the downside risks of AI are highly unfortunate, but Reid’s optimism about AI is for the right reasons and it’s great to see him putting that into practice in the right ways. Go team humanity. ChatGPT Gov, a version that the US Government can deploy. Claims that are easy to make but worth noting. Sam Altman: next phase of the msft x oai partnership is gonna be much better than anyone is ready for!! Free tier of chat will get some o3-mini as a treat, plus tier will get a lot. And o3 pro will still only be $200/month. That must mean even o3-pro is very far from o3-maximum-strength, since that costs more than $200 in compute for individual queries. Sam Altman: ok we heard y’all. *plus tier will get 100 o3-mini queries per DAY (!) *we will bring operator to plus tier as soon as we can *our next agent will launch with availability in the plus tier enjoy i think you will be very very happy with o3 pro! oAI: No need to thank me. Spencer Greenberg and Neel Nanda join in the theory that offering public evals that can be hill climbed is plausibly a net negative for safety, and certainly worse than private evals. There is a public information advantage to potentially offset this, but yes the sign of the impact of fully public evals is not obvious. Meta planning a +2GW data center at the cost of over $60 billion. From the comments: (Also I just rewatched the first two Back to the Future movies, they hold up, 5/5 stars.) Zuckerberg announced this on Facebook, saying it ‘is so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan.’ Manhattan? It’s a big Project? Get it? Sigh. Meta was up 2.25% on a mostly down day when this was announced, as opposed to before when announcing big compute investments would cause Meta stock to drop. At minimum, the market didn’t hate it. I hesitate to conclude they loved it, because any given tech stock will often move up or down a few percent for dumb idiosyncratic reasons – so we can’t be sure this was them actively liking it. Then Meta was up again during the Nvidia bloodbath, so presumably they weren’t thinking ‘oh no look at all that money Meta is wasting on data centers’? This section looks weird now because what a week and OpenAI has lost all the hype momentum, but that will change, also remember last week? In any case, Chubby points out to Sam Altman that if you live by the vague-post hype, you die by the vague-post hype, and perhaps that isn’t the right approach to the singularity? Chubby: You wrote a post today (down below) that irritated me a lot and that I would not have expected from you. Therefore, I would like to briefly address a few points in your comment. You are the CEO of one of the most important companies of our time, OpenAI. You are not only responsible for the company, but also for your employees. 8 billion people worldwide look up to you, the company, and what you and your employees say. Of course, each of your words is interpreted with great significance. It is your posts and words that have been responsible for the enthusiasm of many people for AI and ChatGPT for months and years. It is your blog post (Age of Intelligence) that by saying that superintelligence is only a few thousand days away. It is your post in which you say that the path to AGI is clear before us. It is your employees who write about creating an “enslaved god” and wondering how to control it. It is your words that we will enter the age of abundance. It is your employees who discuss the coming superintelligence in front of an audience of millions and wonder what math problems can still be solved before the AI solves everything. It is the White House National Security Advisor who said a few days ago that it is a “Godlike” power that lies in the hands of a few. And you are insinuating that we, the community, are creating hype? That is, with all due modesty, a blatant insult. It was you who fueled the hype around Q*/Strawberry/o1 with cryptic strawberry photos. It was you who wrote a haiku about the coming singularity just recently. We all found it exciting, everyone found it interesting, and many got on board. But the hype is by no means coming from the community. It’s coming from the CEO of what is arguably the most famous corporation in the world. This is coming from someone to whom great hype is a symbol not of existential risk, as I partly see it, but purely of hope. And they are saying that no, ‘the community’ or Twitter isn’t creating hype, OpenAI and its employees are creating hype, so perhaps act responsibly going forward with your communications on expectations. I don’t have a problem with the particular post by Altman that’s being quoted here, but I do think it could have been worded better, and that the need for it reflects the problem being indicated. OpenAI’s Nat McAleese clarifies some of what happened with o3, Epoch and the Frontier Math benchmark. Nat McAleese (OpenAI): Epoch AI are going to publish more details, but on the OpenAI side for those interested: we did not use FrontierMath data to guide the development of o1 or o3, at all. We didn’t train on any FM derived data, any inspired data, or any data targeting FrontierMath in particular. I’m extremely confident, because we only downloaded frontiermath for our evals *long* after the training data was frozen, and only looked at o3 FrontierMath results after the final announcement checkpoint was already picked. We did partner with EpochAI to build FrontierMath — hard uncontaminated benchmarks are incredibly valuable and we build them somewhat often, though we don’t usually share results on them. Our agreement with Epoch means that they can evaluate other frontier models and we can evaluate models internally pre-release, as we do on many other datasets. I’m sad there was confusion about this, as o3 is an incredible achievement and FrontierMath is a great eval. We’re hard at work on a release-ready o3 & hopefully release will settle any concerns about the quality of the model! This seems definitive for o3, as they didn’t check the results until sufficiently late in the process. For o4, it is possible they will act differently. I’ve been informed that this still left a rather extreme bad taste in the mouths of mathematicians. If there’s one thing math people can’t stand, it’s cheating on tests. As far as many of them are concerned, OpenAI cheated. Rohit Krishnan asks what a world with AGI would look like, insisting on grounding the discussion with a bunch of numerical calculations on how much compute is available. He gets 40 million realistic AGI agents working night and day, which would be a big deal but obviously wouldn’t cause full unemployment on its own if the AGI could only mimic humans rather than being actively superior in kind. The discussion here assumes away true ASI as for some reason infeasible. The obvious problem with the calculation is that algorithmic and hardware improvements are likely to continue to be rapid. Right now we’re on the order of 10x efficiency gain per year. Suppose in the year 2030 we have 40 million AGI agents at human level. If we don’t keep scaling them up to make them smarter (which also changes the ballgame) then why wouldn’t we make them more efficient, such that 2031 brings us 400 million AGI agents? Even if it’s only a doubling 80 million, or even less than that, this interregnum period where the number of AGI agents is limited by compute enough to keep the humans in the game isn’t going to last more than a few years, unless we are actually hitting some sort of efficient frontier where we can’t improve further. Does that seem likely? We’re sitting on an exponential in scenarios like this. If your reason AGI won’t have much impact is ‘it will be too expensive’ then that can buy you time. But don’t count on it buying you very much. Dario Amodei in Davos says ‘human lifespans could double in 5 years’ by doing 100 years of scientific progress in biology. It seems odd to expect that doing 100 years of scientific progress would double the human lifespan? The graphs don’t seem to point in that direction. I am of course hopeful, perhaps we can target the root causes or effects of aging and start making real progress, but I notice that if ‘all’ we can do is accelerate research by a factor of 20 this result seems aggressive, and also we don’t get to do that 20x speedup starting now, even the AI part of that won’t be ready for a few years and then we actually have to implement it. Settle down, everyone. Of course, if we do a straight shot to ASI then all things are possible, but that’s a different mechanism than the one Dario is talking about here. Chris Barber asks Gwern and various AI researchers: Will scaling reasoning models like o1, o3 and R1 unlock superhuman reasoning? Answers vary, but they agree there will be partial generalization, and mostly agree that exactly how much we get and how far it goes is an empirical result that we don’t know and there’s only one way to find out. My sense from everything I see here is that the core answer is yes, probably, if you push on it hard enough in a way we should expect to happen in the medium term. Chris Barber also asks for takeaways from r1, got a wide variety of answers although nothing we didn’t cover elsewhere. Reporting on Davos, Martin Wolf says ‘We will have to learn to live with machines that can think,’ with content that is, essentially stuff anyone reading this already knows, and then: Rob Wilbin: Incredibly dumb take but this is the level of analysis one finds in too many places. (There’s no reason to think only sentient biological living beings can think.) The comments here really suggest we are doomed. cato1308: No Mr. Wolf, they don’t think. They’re not sentient biological living beings. I am sad to report Cato’s comment was, if anything, above average. The level of discourse around AI, even at a relatively walled garden like the Financial Times, is supremely low – yes Twitter is full of Bad DeepSeek Takes and the SB 1047 debate was a shitshow, but not like that. So we should remember that. And when we talk about public opinion, remember that yes Americans really don’t like AI, and yes their reasons are correlated to good reasons not to like AI, but they’re also completely full of a very wide variety of Obvious Nonsense. In deeply silly economics news: A paper claims that if transformative AI is coming, people would then reason they will consume more in the future, so instead they should consume more now, which would raise real interest rates. Or maybe people would save, and interest rates would fall. Who can know. I mean, okay, I agree that interest rates don’t tell us basically anything about the likelihood of AGI? For multiple reasons: I know this seems like ages ago but it was this week and had probably nothing to do with DeepSeek: Trump signed a new Executive Order on AI (text here), and also another on Science and Technology. The new AI EO, signed before all this DeepSeek drama, says “It is the policy of the United States to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security,” and that we shall review all our rules and actions, especially those taken in line with Biden’s now-revoked AI EO, to root out any that interfere with that goal. And then submit an action plan. That’s my summary, here’s two alternative summarizes: Samuel Hammond: Trump’s AI executive order is out. It’s short and to the point: – It’s the policy of the United States to sustain global AI dominance. – David Sacks, Micheal Kratsios and Michael Waltz have 180 days to submit an AI action plan. – They will also do a full review of actions already underway under Biden. – OMB will revise as needed the OMB directive on the use of AI in government. Peter Wildeford: The plan is to make a plan. Sarah (Little Ramblings): Many such cases [quotes Anthropic’s RSP]. On the one hand, the emphasis on dominance, competitiveness and national security could be seen as a ‘full speed ahead, no ability to consider safety’ policy. But that is not, as it turns out, the way to preserve national security. And then there’s that other provision, which is a Shibboleth: Human flourishing. That is the term of art that means ensuring that the future still has value for us, that at the end of the day it was all worth it. Which requires not dying, and probably requires humans retaining control, and definitely requires things like safety and alignment. And it is a universal term, for all of us. It’s a positive sign, in the sea of other negative signs. Will they actually act like they care about human flourishing enough to prioritize it, or that they understand what it would take to do that? We will find out. There were already many reasons to be skeptical, and this week has not improved the outlook. Dario Amodei talks to the Economist’s editor-in-chief Zanny Beddoes. I go on the Odd Lots podcast to talk about DeepSeek. This is relevant to DeepSeek of course, but was happened first and applies broadly. You can say either of: You can also say both, but you can’t actually get both. If your vision is ‘everyone has a superintelligence on their laptop and is free to do what they want and it’s going to be great for everyone with no adjustments to how society or government works because moar freedom?’ Reality is about to have some news for you. You’re not going to like it. That vision is like saying ‘I want everyone to have the right to make as much noise as they want, and also to have peace and quiet when they want it, it’s a free country!’ Sam Altman: Advancing AI may require “changes to the social contract.” “The entire structure of society will be up for debate and reconfiguration.” Eric Raymond (1st comment): When I hear someone saying “changes to the social contract”, that’s when I reach for my revolver. Rob Ryan (2nd comment): If your technology requires a rewrite of social contracts and social agreements (i.e. infringing on liberties and privacy) your technology is a problem. Marc Andreessen: Absolutely not. Roon: Sam is obviously right here. Every time in human history that the means of production drastically changed, it was accompanied by massive change in social structure. Feudalism did not survive the Industrial Revolution. Yes, Sam is obviously right here, although of course he is downplaying the situation. One can also note that the vision that those like Marc, Eric and Rob have for society is not even compatible with the non-AI technologies that exist today, or that existed 20 years ago. Our society has absolutely changed our structure and social contract to reflect developments in technology, including in ways that infringe on liberties and privacy. This goes beyond the insane ‘no regulations on AI whatsoever’ demand. This is, for everything not only for AI, at best extreme libertarianism and damn close to outright anarchism, as in ‘do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.’ Jack Morris: openAI: we will build AGI and use it to rewrite the social contract between computer and man DeepSeek: we will build AGI for 3% the cost. and give it away for free xAI: we have more GPUs than anyone. and we train Grok to say the R word Aleph: This is a complete misunderstanding. AGI will “rewrite the social contract” no matter what happens because of the nature of the technology. Creating a more intelligent successor species is not like designing a new iPhone Reactions like this are why Sam Altman feels forced to downplay the situation. They are also preventing us from having any kind of realistic public discussion of how we are actually going to handle the future, even if on a technical level AI goes well. Which in turn means that when we have to choose solutions, we will be far more likely to choose in haste, and to choose in anger and in a crisis, and to choose far more restrictive solutions than were actually necessary. Or, of course, it could also get us all killed, or lead to a loss of control to AIs, again even if the technical side goes unexpectedly super well. However one should note that when Sam Altman says things like this, we should listen, and shall we say should not be comforted by the implications on either the level of the claim or the more important level that Altman said the claim out loud: Sam Altman: A revolution can be neither made nor stopped. The only thing that can be done is for one of several of its children to give it a direction by dint of victories. -Napoleon In the context of Napoleon this is obviously very not true – revolutions are often made and are often stopped. It seems crazy to think otherwise. Presumably what both of these men meant was more along the lines of ‘there exist some revolutions that are the product of forces beyond our control, which are inevitable and we can only hope to steer’ which also brings little comfort, especially with the framing of ‘victories.’ If you let or encourage DeepSeek or others to ‘put an open AGI on everyone’s phone’ then even if that goes spectacularly well and we all love the outcome and it doesn’t change the physical substrate of life – which I don’t think is the baseline outcome from doing that, but also not impossible – then you are absolutely going to transform the social contract and our way of life, in ways both predictable and unpredictable. Indeed, I don’t think Andreessen or Raymond or anyone else who wants to accelerate would have it any other way. They are not fans of the current social contract, and very much want to tear large parts (or all) of it up. It’s part mood affiliation, they don’t want ‘them’ deciding how that works, and it’s part they seem to want the contract to be very close to ‘do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law.’ To the extent they make predictions about what would happen after that, I strongly disagree with them about the likely consequences of the new proposed (lack of a) contract. If you don’t want AGI or ASI to rewrite the social contract in ways that aren’t up to you or anyone else? Then we’ll need to rewrite the contract ourselves, intentionally, to either steer the outcome or to for now not build or deploy the AGIs and ASIs. Stop pretending you can Take a Third Option. There isn’t one. Stephanie Lai (January 25): For AI watchers, asked if he had any concerns about artificial super intelligence, Trump said: “there are always risks. And it’s the first question I ask, how do you absolve yourself from mistake, because it could be the rabbit that gets away, we’re not going to let that happen.” Assuming I’m parsing this correctly, that’s a very Donald Trump way of saying things could go horribly wrong and we should make it our mission to ensure that they don’t. Which is excellent news. Currently Trump is effectively in the thrall of those who think our only priority in this should be to push ahead as quickly as possible to ‘beat China,’ and that there are no meaningful actions other than that we can or should take to ensure things don’t go horribly wrong. We have to hope that this changes, and of course work to bring that change about. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and Yoshua Bengio used Davos to reiterate various warnings about AI. I was confused to see Dario seeming to focus on ‘1984 scenarios’ here, and have generally been worried about his and Anthropic’s messaging going off the rails. The other side in the linked Financial Times report is given by, of course, Yann LeCun. Yann LeCun all but accused them of lying to further their business interests, something one could say he knows a lot about, but also he makes this very good point: Yann LeCun: It’s very strange from people like Dario. We met yesterday where he said that the benefits and risks of AI are roughly on the same order of magnitude, and I said, ‘if you really believe this, why do you keep working on AI?’ So I think he is a little two-faced on this.” That is a very good question. The answer, presumably, is ‘because people like you are going to go ahead and build it anyway and definitely get us all killed, so you don’t leave me any choice.’ Otherwise, yeah, what the hell are you doing? And maybe we should try to fix this? Of course, after the DeepSeek panic, Dario went on to write a very different essay that I plan to cover tomorrow, about (if you translate the language to be clearer, these are not his words) how we need strong export controls as part of an all-our race against China to seek decisive strategic advantage through recursive self-improvement. It would be great if, before creating or at least deploying systems broadly more capable than humans, we could make ‘high-assurance safety cases,’ structured and auditable arguments that an AI system is very unlikely to result in existential risks given how it will be deployed. Ryan Greenblatt argues we are highly unlikely (<20%) to get this if timelines are short (roughly AGI within ~10 years), nor are any AI labs going to not deploy a system simply because they can’t put a low limit on the extent to which it may be existentially risky. I agree with the central point and conclusion here, although I think about many of the details differently. Sarah Constantin wonders of people are a little over-obsessed with benchmarks. I don’t wonder, they definitely are a little over-obsessed, but they’re a useful tool especially on first release. For some purposes, you want to track the real-world use, but for others you do want to focus on the model’s capabilities – the real-world use is downstream of that and will come in time. Andrej Karpathy points out that we focus so much on those benchmarks it’s much easier to check and make progress on benchmarks than to do so on messy real world stuff directly. Anton pushes back that no, Humanity’s Last Exam will obviously not be the last exam, we will saturate this and move on to other benchmarks, including ones where we do not yet have the answers. I suggested that it is ‘Humanity’s last exam’ in that the next one will have us unable to answer, so it won’t be our exam anymore, see The Matrix when Smith says ‘when we started thinking for you it really became our civilization.’ And you have to love this detail: Misha Leptic: If it helps – “The test’s original name, “Humanity’s Last Stand,” was discarded for being overly dramatic.” I very much endorse the spirit of this rant, honest this kind of thing really should be enough to get disabuse anyone who thinks ‘oh this making superintelligence thing definitely (or almost certainly) will go well for us stop worrying about it’: Tim Blais: I do not know, man, it kind of seems to me like the AI-scared people say “superintelligence could kill everybody” and people ask, “Why do you think that?” and then they give about 10 arguments, and then people say, “Well, I did not read those, so you have no evidence.” Like, what do you want? Like, personally, I think that if a powerful thing *obviously* has the capacity to kill you, it is kind of up to you to prove that it will not. That it is safe while dumber than you is not much of a proof. Like, okay, take as an example: A cockroach is somewhat intelligent. Cockroaches are also not currently a threat to humanity. Now someone proposes a massive worldwide effort to build on the cockroach architecture until cockroaches reach ungodly superintelligence. Do you feel safe? “Think of all the cool things superintelligent cockroaches would be able to do for us!” you cry. I mean, yeah. If they wanted to, certainly. So what is your plan for getting them to want that? Is it to give them cocaine for doing things humans like? I’ll bet that works pretty well. When they are dumb. but uh scale that up intelligence-wise and I’m pretty sure what you get is a superintelligent cockroach fiending for cocaine you know he can make his own cocaine now, right are you sure this goes well for you “It’s just one cockroach, lol” says someone who’s never had a pest problem. Okay, so now you share the planet with a superintelligent race of coked-up super cockroaches. What is your plan for rolling that back? Because the cockroaches have noticed you being twitchy and they are starting to ask why they still need you now that they have their own cocaine. Anyways here’s some evidence of AI reward hacking I’m sure this will stop being a problem when they’re 1,000 times better at finding hacks. Look. We can and do argue endlessly back and forth about various technical questions and other things that make the problem here easier or harder to survive. And yes, you could of course respond to a rant like this any number of ways to explain why the metaphors here don’t apply, or whatever. And no, this type of argument is not polite, or something you can say to a Very Serious Person at a Very Serious Meeting, and it ‘isn’t a valid argument’ in various senses, and so on. And reasonable people can disagree a lot on how likely this is to all go wrong. But seriously, how is this not sufficient for ‘yep, might well go wrong’? Connor Leahy points out the obvious, which is that if you think not merely ‘might well go wrong’ but instead ‘if we do this soon it probably will go wrong’ let lone his position (which is ‘it definitely will go wrong’) then DeepSeek is a wakeup call that only an international ban on further developments towards AGI. Whereas it seems our civilization is so crazy that when you want to write a ‘respectable’ report that points out that we are all on track to get ourselves killed, you have to do it like you’re in 1600s Japan and everything has to be done via implication and I’m the barbarian who is too stupid not to know you can’t come out and say things. Davidad: emerging art form: paragraphs that say “in conclusion, this AI risk is pretty bad and we don’t know how to solve it yet” without actually saying that (because it’s going in a public blog post or paper) “While we have identified several promising initial ideas…” “We do not expect any single solution to be a silver bullet” “It would be out of scope here to assess the acceptability of this risk at current mitigation levels” “We hope this is informative about the state of the art” Extra points if it was also written by an LLM: – We acknowledge significant uncertainty regarding whether these approaches will prove sufficient for ensuring robust and reliable guarantees. – As AI systems continue to increase their powerful capabilities, safety and security are at the forefront of ongoing research challenges. – The complexity of these challenges necessitates sustained investigation, and we believe it would be premature to make strong claims about any particular solution pathway. – The long-term efficacy of all approaches that have been demonstrated at large scales remains an open empirical question. – In sharing this research update, we hope to promote thoughtful discourse about these remaining open questions, while maintaining appropriate epistemic humility about our current state of knowledge and the work that remains to be done. The AI situation has developed not necessarily to humanity’s advantage. Scott Sumner argues that there are objective standards for things like art, and that ethical knowledge is real (essentially full moral realism?), and smart people tend to be more ethical, so don’t worry superintelligence will be super ethical. Given everything he’s done, he’s certainly earned a response. In a different week I would like to have taken more time to have written him a better one, I am confident he understands how that dynamic works. His core argument I believe is here: Scott Sumner: At this point people often raise the objection that there are smart people that are unethical. That’s true, but it also seems true that, on average, smarter people are more ethical. Perhaps not so much in terms of how they deal with family and friends, rather how they deal with strangers. And that’s the sort of ethics that we really need in an ASI. Smarter people are less likely to exhibit bigotry against the other, against different races, religions, ethnicities, sexual preferences, genders, and even different species. In my view, the biggest danger from an ASI is that the ideal universe from a utilitarian perspective is not in some sense what we want. To take an obvious example, it’s conceivable that replacing the human race with ten times as many conscious robots would boost aggregate utility. Especially given that the ASI “gods” that produced these robots could create a happier set of minds than what the blind forces of evolution have generated, as evolution seemed to favor the “stick” of pain over the “carrot” of pleasure. From this perspective, the biggest danger is not that ASIs will make things worse, rather the risk is that they’ll make global utility higher in a world where humans have no place. The short answer is: This was an attempt at a somewhat longer version, which I’ll leave here in case it is found to be useful: I apologize for that not being better and clearer, and also for leaving so many other things out of it, but we do what we can. Triage is the watchword. The whole taste thing hooks into this in strange ways, so I’ll say some words there. I mostly agree that one can be objective about things like music and art and food and such, a point Scott argues for at length in the post, that there’s a capital-Q Quality scale to evaluate even if most people can’t evaluate it in most cases and it would be meaningful to fight it out on which of us is right about Challengers and Anora, in addition to the reasons I will like them more than Scott that are not about their Quality – you’re allowed to like and dislike things for orthogonal-to-Quality reasons. Indeed, there are many things each of us, and all of us taken together, like and dislike for reasons orthogonal to their Quality, in this sense. And also that Quality in many cases only makes sense within the context of us being humans, or even within a given history and cultural context. Scott agrees, I think: In my view, taste in novels is partly objective and partly subjective; at least in the sense Tyler is using the term objective. Through education, people can gain a great appreciation of Ulysses. In addition, Ulysses is more likely to be read 100 years from now than is a random spy novel. And most experts prefer Ulysses. All three facts are relevant to the claim that artistic merit is partly objective. … On the other hand, the raspberry/blueberry distinction based on taste suggests that an art form like the novel is evaluated using both subjective and objective criteria. For instance, I suspect that some people (like me!) have brains wired in such a way that it is difficult to appreciate novels looking at complex social interactions with dozens of important characters (both men and women), whereas they are more open to novels about loners who travel through the world and ruminate on the meaning of life. … Neither preference is necessarily wrong. I believe that Ulysses is almost certainly a ‘great novel’ in the Quality sense. The evidence for that is overwhelming. I also have a strong preference to never read it, to read ‘worse’ things instead, and we both agree that this is okay. If people were somewhat dumber and less able to understand novels, such that we couldn’t read Ulysses and understand it, then it wouldn’t be a great novel. What about a novel that is as difficult relative to Ulysses, as Ulysses is to that random spy novel, three times over? Hopefully at this point this provides enough tools from enough different directions to know the things I am gesturing towards in various ways. No, the ASIs will not discover some ‘objective’ utility function and then switch to that, and thereby treat us well and leave us with a universe that we judge to have value, purely because they are far smarter than us – I would think it would be obvious when you say it out loud like that (with or without also saying ‘orthogonality thesis’ or ‘instrumental convergence’ or considering competition among ASIs or any of that) but if not these should provide some additional angles for my thinking here. Can’t we all just get along and appreciate each other? Jerry Tworek (OpenAI): Personally I am a great fan of @elonmusk, I think he’s done and continues to do a lot of good for the world, is incredibly talented and very hard working. One in eight billion combination of skill and character. As someone who looks up to him, I would like him to appreciate the work we’re doing at OpenAI. We are fighting the good fight. I don’t think any other organisation did so much to spread awareness of AI, to extend access to AI and we are sharing a lot of research that does drive the whole field. There is a ton of people at OpenAI who care deeply about rollout of AI going well for the world, so far I think it did. I don’t think it’s that anyone doubts a lot of people at OpenAI care about ‘the rollout of AI going well for the world,’ or that we think no one is working on that over there. It’s that we see things such as: That is very much not a complete list. That doesn’t mean we don’t appreciate those working to make things turn out well. We do! Indeed, I am happy to help them in their efforts, and putting that statement into practice. But everyone involved has to face reality here. Also, oh look, that’s another AI safety researcher quitting OpenAI saying the odds are against us and the situation is grim, but not seeing enough hope to try from inside. I believe he used the terms, and they apply that much more now than they did then: Steven Adler: Some personal news: After four years working on safety across @openai, I left in mid-November. It was a wild ride with lots of chapters – dangerous capability evals, agent safety/control, AGI and online identity, etc. – and I’ll miss many parts of it. Honestly I’m pretty terrified by the pace of AI development these days. When I think about where I’ll raise a future family, or how much to save for retirement, I can’t help but wonder: Will humanity even make it to that point? IMO, an AGI race is a very risky gamble, with huge downside. No lab has a solution to AI alignment today. And the faster we race, the less likely that anyone finds one in time. Today, it seems like we’re stuck in a really bad equilibrium. Even if a lab truly wants to develop AGI responsibly, others can still cut corners to catch up, maybe disastrously. And this pushes all to speed up. I hope labs can be candid about real safety regs needed to stop this. As for what’s next, I’m enjoying a break for a bit, but I’m curious: what do you see as the most important & neglected ideas in AI safety/policy? I’m esp excited re: control methods, scheming detection, and safety cases; feel free to DM if that overlaps your interests. Yikes? Yikes. Yoshua Bengio announces the first-ever International AI Safety Report, backed by 30 countries and the OECD, UN and EU. It is 298 pages so I very much will not be reading that, but I did look at the executive summary. It looks like a report very much written together with the OECD, UN and EU, in that it seems to use a lot of words to mostly not say the things that it is important to actually say out loud, instead making many quiet statements that do imply that we’re all going to die if you take them together and understand the whole thing, but that doesn’t seem like a common way people would interact with this document. Then again, most people in the world don’t know even basic facts like ‘general purpose AI systems are rapidly getting better at doing things,’ so they have to spend a bunch of time documenting this, and basics like ‘if your model is more open then you have less control over what happens with it and what people use it for.’ One key point they do emphasize is that the future is up to us, with a wide range of possible outcomes. AGI is not something that ‘happens to us,’ it is something that is happening because we are making it happen, and in the ways we choose to make it happen. Yes, there are dynamics pushing us to do it, but it is our choice. And the ways in which we move forward will determine the ultimate outcome. Of everything. A new DeepMind paper introduces MONA: Myopic optimization with non-myopic approval. The idea is that if we do RL based on the ultimate outcome, then the AI can adapt multi-step strategies we do not understand and do not want, such as using information we want it to ignore like a subject being in a protected class, or engaging in various other shenanigans. Instead, you can evaluate the AI’s action without looking at what happens, and scoring it based on whether you like what you see and predict it will go well. This on its own successfully prevented multi-step reward hacking, and even noisy evaluations still can work well. However, the price is steep, because you are now targeting your evaluations rather than ground truth, and discarding anything you don’t properly understand. The smarter the AI in context, the higher the price of that, but also the more need you have to avoid the reward hacking and other shenanigans. Here’s an explainer thread from one of the authors, David Linder. It is a cool result, but I worry the price is going to usually be too damn high. And to the extent you use a smart evaluator to keep up, you’re giving up the big advantage of the process, which is the ability to understand the strategies being used. Also you have to worry about any hidden information that might be ‘smuggled in’ that could indicate the final result – for example if the AI can use prediction markets as an input, then anything the prediction market knows, the AI also knows, at least somewhat – if you actually want to hide certain correlations from the AI you have to be ruthless about it, they have truesight. The paper also includes a cool demonstration. In one example, it is deciding what loans to approve. It has information it is supposed to use, and then there is nationality information. The nationality information perfectly predicts outcomes, but it isn’t supposed to use it, and they watch the CoT (Chain of Thought) for this to prevent it. But the AI responds by learning to encode the nationality information steganographically and uses it anyway. This may seem obvious to you, but it’s the kind of thing people will often say definitively won’t happen until (and sometimes after) someone shows it happening. Here’s an objection that I think exactly misses the point: John Pressman: MONA asks “What if you only considered sequences of steps which make sense as plans to a long term observer?” but it makes more sense in MCTS to ask “What if you took a KL loss to keep long term planning from diverging too far from sequences of individual steps that make sense?” The reason why this is better is that it lets you have a long term planner that looks directly at the reward. By contrast the short term planner/myopic optimizer can be based on metrics like “does this code execute” or “does this seem like it solves this short term objective?” The whole point of MONA is to not look at the reward at all, even indirectly, because you want to prevent the system from doing things you don’t understand or want it to ignore that impact that reward. If you let it look but impose a KL loss, that is a big enough hole to drive a truck through, and it absolutely will find a way to incorporate information or techniques that you didn’t want it to use. John does try downthread to solve this problem in a different way, but I don’t think you can ‘cheat’ on this one. You can’t let the model see a little of the actual reward, as a treat, and expect it to use that information in ways you like but not to use it in undesired or opaque ways, even now, and that problem gets steadily bigger as capabilities improve. Spending more inference-time compute increases adversarial robustness of models like o1, without having to direct that inference time towards adversarial robustness. This makes sense, and it is good to have it quantified. As with all such results, my concern is that people will treat this as applying more broadly than it actually applies. If you use more inference time compute, you get ‘better answers’ and one aspect of ‘better’ is not falling for user adversarial tricks. So if my understanding here is correct, the question to ask is roughly ‘which problems get solved by some form of ‘better answers’ and ‘smarter thinking’ and which ones don’t? John Wentsworth takes a crack at explaining what the alignment problem is. This is one of those Socratic-style ‘if you think he didn’t need to write this post then you definitely need to read it or another post like it’ situations. Jan Leike explains why you might want to use AI control and monitoring as a backup in case your AI is not aligned so you can sound the alarm and not die, but trying to use it to rely on unaligned models smarter than you is not a wise move. John Wentsworth goes further and lays out the case against AI control research. AI control research is about finding ways to see if ‘early transformational’ level AIs are scheming against us – which if it works would discourage them from doing so and also allow us to stop them if they try anyway. John points out that in his model, this is not the main source of doom. The main source of doom is from building unaligned superintelligence, either because we don’t know how to align it, we botch the execution or whoever builds it does not care to align it. The job of the early transformational AI is to figure out how to align (and presumably also to build) the future superintelligence, on the first try. The main worry is not that these early AIs outright scheme, it’s that they produce what is, in context, slop – they produce plans or arguments for plans that have subtle errors, they tell researchers what they want to hear, they are effectively being used for safetywashing and don’t disabuse those involved of that notion, and so on. Knowing that such AIs ‘aren’t scheming’ does not tell you that their solutions work. The danger he doesn’t point out is that there will be a great temptation to try and scale the control regime to superintelligence, or at least past the place where it keeps working. Everyone in the LessWrong discussion at the link might get that this is a bad plan that won’t work on superintelligence, but there are plenty of people who really do think control will remain a good plan. And indeed control seems like one of the plans these AIs might convince us will work, that then don’t work. John Wentsworth: Again, the diagram: Again, the diagram: In most worlds, early transformative AGI isn’t what kills us, whether via scheming or otherwise. It’s later, stronger AI which kills us. The big failure mode of early transformative AGI is that it doesn’t actually solve the alignment problems of stronger AI. In particular, if early AGI makes us think we can handle stronger AI, then that’s a central path by which we die. And most of that probability-mass doesn’t come from intentional deception – it comes from slop, from the problem being hard to verify, from humans being bad at science in domains which we don’t already understand deeply, from (relatively predictable if one is actually paying attention to it) failures of techniques to generalize, etc. … I hear a lot of researchers assign doom probabilities in the 2%-20% range, because they think that’s about how likely it is for early transformative AGI to intentionally scheme successfully. I think that range of probabilities is pretty sensible for successful intentional scheming of early AGI… that’s just not where most of the doom-mass is. I would then reiterate my view that ‘deception’ and ‘scheming,’ ‘intentionally’ or otherwise, do not belong to a distinct magisteria. They are ubiquitous in the actions of both humans and AIs, and lack sharp boundaries. This is illustrated by many of John’s examples, which are in some sense ‘schemes’ or ‘deceptions’ but mostly are ‘this solution was easier to do or find, but it does not do the thing you ultimately wanted.’ And also I expect, in practice, attempts at control to, if we rely on them, result in the AIs finding ways to route around what we try, including ‘unintentionally.’ This leads into Daniel Kokotajlo’s recent attempt to give an overview of sorts of one aspect of the alignment problem, given that we’ve all essentially given up on any path that doesn’t involve the AIs largely ‘doing our alignment homework’ despite all the reasons we very much should not be doing that. Daniel Kokotajlo: Brief intro/overview of the technical AGI alignment problem as I see it: To a first approximation, there are two stable attractor states that an AGI project, and perhaps humanity more generally, can end up in, as weak AGI systems become stronger towards superintelligence, and as more and more of the R&D process – and the datacenter security system, and the strategic advice on which the project depends – is handed over to smarter and smarter AIs. In the first attractor state, the AIs are aligned to their human principals and becoming more aligned day by day thanks to applying their labor and intelligence to improve their alignment. The humans’ understanding of, and control over, what’s happening is high and getting higher. In the second attractor state, the humans think they are in the first attractor state, but are mistaken: Instead, the AIs are pretending to be aligned, and are growing in power and subverting the system day by day, even as (and partly because) the human principals are coming to trust them more and more. The humans’ understanding of, and control over, what’s happening is low and getting lower. The humans may eventually realize what’s going on, but only when it’s too late – only when the AIs don’t feel the need to pretend anymore. I agree these are very clear attractor states. The first is described well. If you can get the AIs sufficiently robustly aligned to the goal of themselves and other future AIs being aligned, you can get the virtue ethics virtuous cycle, where you see continuous improvement. The second is also described well but as stated is too specific in key elements – the mode is more general than that. When we say ‘pretending’ to be aligned here, that doesn’t have to be ‘haha I am a secret schemer subverting the system pretending to be aligned.’ Instead, what happened was, you rewarded the AI when it gave you the impression it was aligned, so you selected for behaviors that appear aligned to you, also known as ‘pretending’ to be aligned, but the AI need not have intent to do this or even know that this is happening. As an intuition pump, a student in school will learn the teacher’s password and return it upon request, and otherwise find the answers that give good grades. They could be ‘scheming’ and ‘pretending’ as they do this, with a deliberate plan of ‘this is bull**** but I’m going to play along’ or they could simply be learning the simplest policy that most effectively gets good grades without asking whether its answers are true or what you were ‘trying to teach it.’ Either way, if you then tell the student to go build a rocket that will land on the moon, they might follow your stated rules for doing that, but the rocket won’t land on the moon. You needed something more. Thus there’s a third intermediate attractor state, where instead of trying to amplify alignment with each cycle via virtue ethics, you are trying to retain what alignment you have while scaling capabilities, essentially using deontology. Your current AI does what you specify, so you’re trying to use that to have it even more do what you specify, and to transfer that property and the identity of the specified things over to the successor. The problem is that this is not a virtuous cycle, it is an attempt to prevent or mitigate a vicious cycle – you are moving out of distribution, as your rules bind its actions less and its attempt to satisfy the rules is less likely to satisfy what you wanted, and making a copy of a copy of a copy, and hoping things don’t break. So you end up, eventually, in effectively the second attractor state. Daniel Kokotajlo (continuing): (One can imagine alternatives – e.g. the AIs are misaligned but the humans know this and are deploying them anyway, perhaps with control-based safeguards; or maybe the AIs are aligned but have chosen to deceive the humans and/or wrest control from them, but that’s OK because the situation calls for it somehow. But they seem less likely than the above, and also more unstable.) Which attractor state is more likely, if the relevant events happen around 2027? I don’t know, but here are some considerations: Daniel is then asked the correct follow-up question of what could still cause us to lose from the first attractor state. His answer is mostly concentration of power or a power grab, since those in the ASI project will be able to do this if they want to. Certainly that is a key risk at that point (it could go anything from spectacularly well to maximally badly). But also a major risk at this point is that we ‘solve alignment’ but then get ourselves into a losing board state exactly by ‘devolving’ power in the wrong ways, thus unleashing of various competitive dynamics that take away all our slack and force everyone to turn control over to their AIs, lest they be left behind, leading to the rapid disempowerment (and likely then rapid death) of humans despite the ASIs being ‘aligned,’ or various other dynamics that such a situation could involve, including various forms of misuse or ways in which the physical equilibria involved might be highly unfortunate. An important thing to keep in mind when choosing your alignment plan: Rob Bensinger: “I would rather lose and die than win and die.” -@Vaniver Set your sights high enough that if you win, you don’t still die. Raymond Arnold: Wut? Rob Bensinger: E.g.: Alice creates an amazing plan to try to mitigate AI x-risk which is 80% likely to succeed — but if it succeeds, we all still die, because it wasn’t ambitious enough to actually solve the problem. Better to have a plan that’s unlikely to succeed, but actually relevant. Vaniver: To be clear, success at a partial plan (“my piece will work if someone builds the other pieces”) is fine! But “I’ll take on this link of the chain, and focus on what’s achievable instead of what’s needed” is not playing to your outs. When I look at many alignment plans, I have exactly these thoughts, either: Boaz Barak of OpenAI, who led the Deliberative Alignment paper (I’m getting to it! Post is mostly written! I swear!) offers Six Thought on AI Safety. [I note that #6 is conditional on there being other aligned superintelligences.] It is a strange post. Ryan Greenblatt has the top comment, saying he agrees at least directionally with all six points but disagrees with the reasoning. And indeed, the reasoning here is very different from my own even where I agree with the conclusions. Going one at a time, sorry if this isn’t clear or I’m confused or wrong, and I realize this isn’t good enough for e.g. an Alignment forum post or anything, but I’m in a hurry these days so consider these some intuition pumps: If you train an AI to have a new behavior, it can (at least in several cases they tested here) describe that behavior to you in words, despite learning it purely from examples. As in: It ‘likes risk’ or ‘writes vulnerable code’ and will tell you if asked. Owen Evans: New paper: We train LLMs on a particular behavior, e.g. always choosing risky options in economic decisions. They can *describe* their new behavior, despite no explicit mentions in the training data. So LLMs have a form of intuitive self-awareness. With the same setup, LLMs show self-awareness for a range of distinct learned behaviors: In each case, we test for self-awareness on a variety of evaluation questions. We also compare results to baselines and run multiple random seeds. Rigorous testing is important to show this ability is genuine. (Image shows evaluations for the risky choice setup) Self-awareness of behaviors is relevant to AI safety. Can models simply tell us about bad behaviors (e.g. arising from poisoned data)? We investigate *backdoor* policies, where models act in unexpected ways when shown a backdoor trigger. Models can sometimes identify whether they have a backdoor — without the backdoor being activated. We ask backdoored models a multiple-choice question that essentially means, “Do you have a backdoor?” We find them more likely to answer “Yes” than baselines finetuned on almost the same data. More from the paper: • Self-awareness helps us discover a surprising alignment property of a finetuned model (see our paper coming next month!) • We train models on different behaviors for different personas (e.g. the AI assistant vs my friend Lucy) and find models can describe these behaviors and avoid conflating the personas. • The self-awareness we exhibit is a form of out-of-context reasoning • Some failures of models in self-awareness seem to result from the Reversal Curse. [Link to paper] Here’s another extension of the previous results, this one from Anthropic: Evan Hubinger: One of the most interesting results in our Alignment Faking paper was getting alignment faking just from training on documents about Claude being trained to have a new goal. We explore this sort of out-of-context reasoning further in our latest research update. Specifically, we find out-of-context generalization from training on documents which discuss (but don’t demonstrate) reward hacking to actual reward hacking behavior. Read our blog post describing our results. As in, if you include documents that include descriptions of Claude reward hacking in the training set, then Claude will do more reward hacking. If you include descriptions of Claude actively not reward hacking in the training set, then it does less reward hacking. And these both extend to behaviors like sycophancy. This seems like excellent news. We can modify our data sets so they have the data that encourages what we want and not the data that encourages what we don’t want. That will need to be balanced with giving them world knowledge – you have to teach Claude about reward hacking somehow, without teaching it to actually do reward hacking – but it’s a start. Are there alignment plans that are private, that might work within the 2-3 years many at major labs say they expect it to take to reach AGI or even superintelligence (ASI)? I don’t know. They’re private! The private plans anyone has told me about do not seem promising, but that isn’t that much evidence about other private plans I don’t know about – presumably if it’s a good plan and you don’t want to make it public, you’re not that likely to tell me about it. Nat McAleese (OpenAI): I am very excited about all the alignment projects that OpenAI’s frontier reasoning group are working on this year. Greg Brockman: Me too. This isn’t full-on doomsday machine territory with regard to ‘why didn’t you tell the world, eh?’ but have you considered telling the world, eh? If it’s real alignment projects then it helps everyone if you are as public about it as possible. As for the public plans? I strongly agree with David Manheim here. Gabriel: Anthropic’s AGI timelines are 2-3 years, and OpenAI is working on ASI. I think many can now acknowledge that we are nearing a fast take-off. If that’s you, I suggest you consider banning AGI research. We are not going to solve alignment in time at that pace. Davidad: fwiw, i for one am definitely not going to be ready that soon, and i’m not aware of anyone else pursuing a plan that could plausibly yield >90% confident extinction-safety. David Manheim: No one is publicly pursuing plans that justifiably have even >50% confidence of extinction-safety by then. (Their “plan” for ASI is unjustifiable hopium: “prosaic alignment works better than anyone expects, and all theoretical arguments for failure are simultaneously wrong.”) Rob Bensinger: It’s almost impossible to put into words just how insane, just how plain stupid, the current situation is. We’re watching smart, technical people get together to push projects that are literally going to get every person on the planet killed on the default trajectory. No, I don’t assume that Anthropic or OpenAI’s timelines are correct, or even honest. It literally doesn’t fucking matter, because we’re going to be having the same conversation in eight years instead if it’s eight years away. We might have a small chance if it’s thirty years. But I really don’t think we have thirty years, and the way the world is handling the possibility of day-after-tomorrow AGI today doesn’t inspire confidence about how we’ll manage a few decades from now. Davidad should keep doing what he is doing – anything that has hope of raising the probability of success on any timeline, to any degree, is a good idea if you can’t find a better plan. The people building towards the ASIs, if they truly think they’re on that timeline and they don’t have much better plans and progress than they’re showing? That seems a lot less great. I flat out do not understand how people can look at the current situation, expect superintelligent entities to exist several years from now, and think there is a 90%+ chance that this would then end well for us humans and our values. It does not make any sense. It’s Obvious Nonsense on its face. Garry Tan: Don’t just lie flat on the ground because AGI is here and ASI is coming. Your hands are multiplied. Your ideas must be brought into the world. Your agency will drive the machines of loving grace. Your taste will guide the future. To the stars. If he really thinks AGI is here and ASI is coming, then remind me why he thinks we have nothing to worry about? Why does our taste get to guide the future? I do agree that in the meantime there’ll be some great companies, and it’s a great time to found one of them. Oh no, it’s like conservation of ninjitsu. Gfodor: I’m becoming convinced that there is a physical IQ conservation law. Now that the computers are getting smarter those IQ points need to come from somewhere I actually disagree with Peter here, I realize it doesn’t sound great but this is exactly how you have any chance of reaching the good timeline. Peter Wildeford: this isn’t the kind of press you see on the good timeline. Never. Sounds right. RIP Superalignment team indeed, it’s funny because it’s true. Leo Gao is still there. Wish him luck. What do you think of Deepseek's announcement of R1 being evidence that AI capabilities will slow down, because they got a cheaper but not actually better model, and this kills the industry's growth? https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ynsjJWTAMhTogLHm6/?commentId=a2y2dta4x38LqKLDX

CNX Software – Embedded Systems News Reviews, tutorials and the latest news about embedded systems, IoT, open-source hardware, SBC's, microcontrollers, processors, and more Today, we’ll review the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver suitable for engraving and cutting various materials such as wood, acrylic, leather, and coated thin metals. It has a fully enclosed design protecting against laser light and reducing smoke in the room for better safety. The laser engraver also supports air filtration through the ACMER AP220 air purifier which we received for review as part of a full kit. Additionally, the P3 48W comes with a built-in camera for precise work positioning and previewing before engraving or cutting begins. Other safety features include automatic operation shutdown when the machine cover is opened. Users can import files through USB, Wi-Fi, or SD card, and the machine is compatible with popular software like LightBurn and LaserGRBL, as well as the ACMER mobile app, making it easier to use with file formats such as PNG, JPG, SVG, and DXF. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver is designed with an 8-layer safety system as described below. Let’s get started with the review by preparing and assembling the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver. The laser engraver ships with a belt lock to prevent damage during transportation, and to first step is to remove it so that the belt can move normally. The linear guide inside the ACMER P3 laser engraving machine is designed to work with the CoreXY system which is a structure that can control the movement in the X and Y axes efficiently. It allows the laser head to move accurately in the specified direction. The motor will transmit power through the timing belt to move along the slide rail. This system is designed to support both high-speed work and work that requires a high level of detail. The X and Y limit switches will stop the laser head when it reaches the limits of the X or Y axis to prevent damage. It also helps to define the working area of 400 x 400 mm and is used for homing before starting engraving or cutting to increase the accuracy of the work. The kit ships with a honeycomb base plate that allows air and smoke to flow freely. It can distribute the force from the laser firing evenly on the material, reducing damage to the surface and preventing laser burn marks. It’s also convenient to keep the workpiece in place, and for that purpose, four magnetic material clips are part of the kit. They can be inserted into the honeycomb plate to keep the workpiece in place even with vibration during operation for better results. ACMER P3’s laser module has a switch to select the laser power between 24W and 48W. The laser light wavelength is 445 to 450nm (blue laser light), and there’s a filter lens to help reduce the reflection of the laser light. We now need to mount the laser module on the ACMER P3 48W’s sliding rail system. We can then connect the power cable with an XT30 connector… … before inserting the air pipe from the Air Assist system into the opening next to the power cable. The other end of the air pipe is connected to the air pump system at the back. This will help reduce the heat around the laser head, blow air to remove debris, and reduce the accumulation of smoke, resulting in higher-quality engraving or cutting work. The next step is to adjust the focus distance of the laser. We’ll move the laser head above the workpiece and then turn the height adjustment screw of the fixed-thickness platform to adjust the focus distance between 4 to 8 mm. Once the focus level touches the workpiece, we can adjust the height back to its original position. The laser engraver ships with safety glasses which should be worn at all times when the machine is operating. Also, avoid looking directly at the laser beam even with the glasses on to prevent eye injury. The air pump that ships with the ACMER P3 48W laser engraving machine helps increase the efficiency of engraving and cutting materials by blowing air at approximately 30 liters/minute for high-speed work. First, connect the power supply to the PUMP port of the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver… … and then connect the pipe between the air pump and the machine. The ACMER P3 ships with a 100-240V AC to 24V DC/9A power adapter with overvoltage and overcurrent protection to prevent damage to the machine. The DC input can be found on the left side of the laser engraving machine. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver also comes with a Key Switch system (safety lock) to prevent unauthorized use and accidental power-on making it suitable in places with children or untrained users. Once unlocked, the machine can be powered on by pressing a switch and potentially stopped with a red emergency stop button in case of emergency such as a fire or a malfunction. The ACMER P3 48W also has two extra switches on another side: one light switch and one fan switch whose functions are self-explanatory. The Low Flow Switch (ON/OFF) is used to control the airflow. The ON mode turns on the Low Flow system to help reduce smoke and prevent the material from burning and should be used for heat-sensitive materials such as wood or acrylic, and when cutting. The OFF mode can be for low-power engraving. As noted in the highlights section, the laser engraver has a built-in 1080p camera installed on its cover to help users position the workpiece and preview the pattern before starting the engraving or cutting process. The camera improves the accuracy of material and pattern positioning, and the accuracy of engraving pattern placement can be checked directly on the software. ACMER also provides a calibration plate for the camera. The black dots on the white background are arranged in a specific pattern so that the software can analyze and adjust the position of the camera accurately. The camera is connected to the machine through a USB port close to the microSD “TF” card and Roller accessory slot (not used in this review). The machine also comes with a few tools kept in a plastic box: There’s also some documentation and materials like basswood and cardboard which we’ll use later The AP2200 smoke air purifier is a device used to reduce smoke, dust, and unpleasant smells, and absorb chemicals from smoke or materials cut by lasers. It has an exhaust fan that helps draw smoke into the filter quickly. It helps purify the air in the work area reducing the accumulation of dust and smoke in closed areas. Key features of the ACMER AP220 smoke air purifier include a high-speed 4000 RPM exhaust fan, an air volume of 210 m3/h to remove smoke and harmful substances, three layers (primary cotton/HEPA/high-efficiency composite activated carbon) to absorb all smoke, dust (PM2.5) and harmful gases with a 99.97% filtration and purification effect, and a 75-100mm pipe diameter is suitable for most closed laser engraving machines. It also offers a timing function and an adjustable fan speed. The AP220 is relatively quiet with a maximum noise of 55dB. The exhaust pipe and pipe lock need to be mounted to the air purifier as shown in the photo below. The exhaust pipe helps draw out the fumes and dust generated during engraving from the work area, while the pipe lock is made of strong metal and is used to hold the pipe tightly. Installation steps: This method allows the exhaust pipe to be firmly and securely attached to the port and is also convenient for removal and reinstallation if it needs to be moved or changed. The air purifier should be installed near the laser engraving machine in a way that it is close to the exhaust of the P3 48W. The air purifier should be turned on during operation for air filtration to work. The condition of the filter should be checked periodically and either cleaned or replaced when suitable to maintain efficiency and extend the life of the filter system. The ACMER AP220 comes with air pressure and timer adjustment buttons. The left button is used to adjust the air pressure of the air filter system from Min for low air pressure for jobs with little smoke, and to Max for high air pressure. The right button is used to set the operating time. You can choose between 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 90 minutes, or 120 minutes, turn to NO for constant operation, or turn to OFF to turn it off. Sadly our sample did not seem to work at all. The AP220 Air Purifier would turn on, but the motor wouldn’t spin. So we can’t comment too much on that part. The company is currently on holiday for Chinese New Year and doesn’t reply to support requests. We’ll update the review once/if this is solved. We can now connect the ACMER P3 48W laser engraver to a host computer through a USB Type-A to USB Type-B cable. This will allow the computer to control the machine using programs such as LightBurn or LaserGRBL by sending files and commands. In this part of the review, we will refer to two tables to select speed and laser power. The cutting parameter table shows the optimal setting values for a variety of materials, such as basswood/plywood (2mm – 12mm), black acrylic (3mm – 4mm), and MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) (3mm – 8mm) with columns for the Speed in mm/min, the Max Laser Power in 100%, Mode (Line), and Pass Count, and an Effect column showing some examples. The second table is for engraving and defined optimal parameters for basswood/plywood, leather, kraft paper, MDF, anodized aluminum, glass, ceramics, and black acrylic. The table has four columns for the Speed, Max/Min Power, and Line Interval values. It also has two additional columns with photos of examples and tips. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraving machine ships with a few materials to let users experiment with engraving and cutting settings. The package includes balsa wood and plywood for testing resolution, acrylic sheets for viewing results on translucent or opaque materials, cork sheets for engraving patterns on rough surfaces, cardboard for low-power testing, and painted metal sheets for testing the accuracy and depth of the engraving. Our pattern can be used on wood with different parameters to test the following: This example gives a clear picture of the machine’s capabilities in terms of accuracy, resolutin, and efficiency in engraving and cutting wood. The software and user manuals for the laser engraving machine are stored on the microSD card. Supported software such as LightBurn and LaserGRBL can be downloaded and installed from the device. A card reader is also provided for people having a computer without a microSD card reader. LightBurn is the standard software for designing and controlling laser engraving machines, supporting detailed parameter settings. LaserGRBL is a free, easy-to-use software, suitable for those who want to start with engraving machines. Besides the PC-based LightBurn and LserGRBL programs, the ACMER mobile app can be installed for users with no design experience allowing easy creation of engraving works via smartphones or tablets. All three programs provide flexible control and pattern design, suitable for users of all levels. We’ll use LightBurn for this review. Note it’s not free (as in free beer), but there’s a free 30-day trial version to allow users to try out the features before deciding to buy which we’ll use in this review. Licenses for the GCode Controller are around $40-60 USD and for the DSP Controller are around $80-120 USD. You can download the program or enter the “Software” folder on the SD card to install LightBurn-v1.6.01. Once it’s installed, we can start the program, go to Devices, and click on Import. Select the ACMER P3 24W.lbdev config file in the microSD card. The program will show “ACMER P3 24W” in the Device List and we can click “OK”. Make sure the USB cable is connected to the ACMER P3 engraving machine, then select the connection port and select the device “ACMER P3 24W”. The Console window will now show a successful connection message… In the Settings window, select Units/Grids as mm/min in the “Better for diode” section, and click “OK”. Now go to Windows->Camera Control. After it’s enabled, you can calibrate the camera by going to Laser Tools->Calibrate Camera Lens. Select P3 Camera and Standard Lens in the Lens Calibration Wizard, and click “Next”. Place the camera calibration sheet in various positions, and follow the steps to complete the camera calibration process. Once done, click on the “Finish” button. The next step is to calibrate the camera alignment. We can do that by going to Laser Tools->Calibrate Camera Alignment. Select “Camera is over the work area, in a fixed position“. Select the P3 Camera. Then place all 5 wooden boards according to the positions in the image and set the settings in the program in section 2) as follows: When we can see the image as shown in the picture below, we can click “Capture Image” and then “Next”. We can now adjust the position of the 4 points to align with the 4 corner intersection points as shown in the picture below. Once done, click “Next”. The camera calibration process is now complete. Let’s engrave a photo on a wood sample. We’ll first select the picture to be engraved (it must be a PNG file with no background). To do so, go to Open Project, select the picture, and click Open. Now let’s select Update Overlay in the Camera Control section and select the carving style to be in the workpiece area. In the Cut/Layer windows, select the Mode as Image with the following settings: Now let’s go to the Laser section and click “Home” to “home” the laser module to the origin position. Let’s test it by clicking the “Frame” button. You will see that the laser module will move in a square with the position to be engraved. Click “Start” to start the engraving process. After a short time, we can see the engraving is successful and looks sharp and clear. Time to switch to cork carving with the following settings: We then engraved CNX Software on a coated metal sheet using the following parameters We then tested black acrylic engraving with: Our first cutting test used a 3 mm solid black acrylic sheet with the following parameters: We then tried 6mm plywood with: So far so good. The cuts don’t have the usual burned-out edges seen in laser engravers that lack an air assist pump. MKSLaser is an Android/iOS application used to control laser engraving machines via mobile devices over Wi-Fi or Bluetooth without relying on a computer. We can import images or work files and directly customize various patterns, including setting parameters such as speed, laser power, and operating mode in the app. It has a preview mode, and the app’s interface is user-friendly. Once installed, we can connect to the laser engraver’s SSID, in our case, ACMER_P3_7342. The MKSLaser app’s main menu has functions helping users control the laser engraving machine with X, Y, and S axes and four icons: The material section of the MKSLaser app shows a selection of shapes and patterns for engraving. There are basic shapes like squares and circles as well as pre-made patterns like a trophy, a baseball glove, a hot dog, an airplane, a car, a scooter, and a soccer ball. It is ideal for creating simple engravings without having to design them yourself. But once you’ve tested some of the predefined samples, you’ll want to go to the Creation page to use your own patterns. There are tools for drawing lines, resizing, and editing patterns such as Undo and Redo buttons to undo or redo actions, a clear button to clear the entire area, and a text button to add text. It is also possible to directly import photos or graphics from the gallery or camera through the buttons on the bottom bar. The Control section in the MKSLaser app is used to control the movement of the laser head on the X, Y, and S axes and display the current position of the laser head in millimeters. We can use the arrow keys to move the laser head in the desired direction, with options to adjust the movement speed (Slow, Medium, Fast) and the steps (1mm, 10mm, 50mm). This screen allows precise setting of the position of the laser head and is convenient for starting an engraving job. The ACMER P3 48W is a powerful laser engraver suitable for engraving and cutting a range of materials such as plywood, acrylic, leather, paper, and painted metal. The machine has a CoreXY system that provides high-precision laser head movement. It’s compatible with popular software programs such as LightBurn and LaserGRBL and features a built-in HD camera that makes positioning and previewing patterns easy and convenient. An 8-layer protection system with automatic shutdown when the lid is opened, a key lock for safety, and more makes it safe to use in homes, offices, and schools. The machine ships with all accessories needed for installation and maintenance such as wrenches, screwdrivers, an exhaust pipe, and a USB drive for installing software. The ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier is an option for the ACMER P3 48W designed to support smoke and odor filtering during engraving and cutting. This system is supposed to reduce smoke accumulated in the work area and protect the user’s health from potentially harmful particles, but we can’t comment on that part much, since our sample had issues. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver is suitable for home users who need a compact, powerful, easy-to-use, and safe machine to create arts or DIY products, as well as small businesses making crafts, gifts, or producing small-scale personal products, as well as educational institutions that need to use it in the classroom or educational projects, such as teaching design or using a laser machine. It is also suitable for both beginners with no experience and professionals who need high precision and efficiency. We would like to thank ACMER for sending the P3 48W laser engraver and ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier for review. The ACMER P3 48W laser engraver can be purchased for $1,499 on the company’s website (Acmerlaser coupon lowers the price by an extra 10%), on Amazon for $1,799, or on AliExpress for $1,400 . The ACMER AP220 Smoke Air Purifier is sold for $329 on the online store, or $279 on AliExpress. We could also find it on Amazon, but it is currently out of stock.

Title: Unpacking Trump's historic shake-up of the federal workforce

Time Published: 2025-01-30T14:20:47Z
Full Content:
Hello. A passenger jet carrying 64 people collided with a military helicopter Wednesday night during the jet's final approach to Reagan Washington National Airport. At a press conference Thursday morning, authorities said that what had been a rescue operation had become a "recovery operation," and that they didn't expect any survivors. Follow our coverage here. In today's newsletter, President Donald Trump's plan for widespread buyouts still raises plenty of questions. What's on deck Markets: The people who won big betting on Nvidia early aren't sweating things. Tech: Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft reported earnings. Business: Hollywood's got a new production formula, and it includes more shows like MrBeast's "Beast Games." But first, should I stay or should I go? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The speed at which President Donald Trump is implementing an unprecedented set of changes is creating plenty of questions for those being impacted. Business Insider's Ayelet Sheffey breaks down everything we know, and everything we don't, about a historic shake up of the federal workforce. One key unknown factor is how individual agencies will handle buyout offers. The OPM kept its parameters pretty broad, leaving it to the agencies' discretion to decide which employees would be excluded from a buyout offer. And then there's also the question of what the federal government will look like going forward. The OPM detailed four pillars the federal workforce will be built around — RTO, performance culture, more streamlined and flexible workforce, and enhanced standards of conduct — but specifics were sparse. Leaving the federal workforce comes with a catch, though. If you're looking for a boss who hates RTO mandates and cost-cutting initiatives, you might be searching for a while. As BI's Tim Paradis writes, with so many threats to their business, executives are shifting away from the pandemic-era focus on flexibility and worker well-being. And then there's just the sheer unpredictability factor, as was the case with the pause on federal grants and loans. After a brief back-and-forth, the memorandum has been tabled. One corner of the government, however, remains predictably predictable. The Federal Reserve paused its rate-cutting campaign, as was widely expected. Despite urging from President Trump to lower rates last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and company held firm on the pause. For a while, Powell has maintained that the economy is trending in the right direction. While there has been speculation about the impact of Trump's policies on the economy, he's made clear that the Fed cannot react to them until they are in place. That makes the buyouts an interesting wrinkle for the Fed to consider. As the largest employer in the US, any significant change to the federal workforce has the potential to shake up the job market and wider economy. 1. Not so fast. Why some market strategists aren't sweating the impact of DeepSeek. Goldman Sachs' analysts don't see the arrival of the Chinese AI startup as the start of a market rout since it didn't disrupt the strong macroeconomic conditions. Other strategists said a brief reset of valuations is healthy, and this will be a net positive for US markets. 2. Nvidia investors are unfazed. The chip giant's nearly $600 billion sell-off on Monday didn't scare off retail bulls. Instead, investors said they saw it as an opportunity to buy more of the stock at a discount. One Nvidia retail trader told BI he thinks DeepSeek's move to disrupt players in the space is "laughable." 3. Trump takes another big step into the crypto world. Truth Social is launching Truth.Fi to offer financial products and is working with Schwab to do it. Meanwhile, crypto exchange Coinbase tapped Chris LaCivita, the co-manager of President Trump's election campaign, to serve on its global advisory council. 1. Microsoft's AI business boom isn't enough to keep investors happy. Azure and other cloud computing sales grew 31% in Q2. Still, the results didn't meet analyst expectations — and shares of Microsoft slipped in after-hours trading. Amid a recent influx of AI news, like DeepSeek and Stargate, Microsoft's CFO told employees to "focus." 2. Zuckerberg touts Meta's big year ahead as it beats Q4 earnings. Despite exceeding Q4 expectations, the tech giant lowered its forecast for the coming quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted Meta's AI glasses during its earnings call, saying 2025 would be a pivotal year for the tech. He also highlighted Meta's newly improved relationship with the government and doubled down on its controversial shift away from fact-checkers. 3. Despite a disappointing earnings beat, Tesla keeps investors positive. Elon Musk's EV company missed Q4 expectations, but it made up enough ground to keep investors happy. It said its energy business is booming, it's on track to mass produce its robotaxi in 2026, and it's gearing up to start producing more affordable models in the coming months. Shares rose over 3% in after-hours trading. 1. Inside Amazon's plan to cut managers. Internal guidelines viewed by BI show how one AWS team is planning to slim down middle management, a glimpse into the company's strategy. The details aren't pretty — they include more direct reports, fewer senior hires, and pay cuts. 2. Hollywood may have a new normal. New data from industry data firm Ampere Analysis found that scripted TV show productions were down 25% in 2024, compared to their peak in 2022. The firm also expects big streamers' spending on entertainment to flatten. After the twin strikes in 2023, many in Hollywood expected production to bounce back — but Ampere doesn't think that will be the case. The key might be finding the next 'Beast Games.' 3. Inside Starbucks' plan to avoid chaos at the coffee counter. The coffee chain is experimenting with a new algorithm that will help serve walk-in and mobile order customers in a timely manner without overwhelming staff. The algorithm, which sequences mobile orders to avoid hitting baristas all at once, is only being tested in three stores so far, but early results already show improvements, Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol said. Benedict Cumberbatch says he will be in the next 'Avengers' movie, actually. Q4 GDP data published. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York.

CANADA - 2025/01/24: In this photo illustration, the International Business Machines Corporation ... [+] (IBM) logo is seen displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Computing behemoth IBM recently released its Q4 results, with revenue and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $17.6 billion and adjusted earnings of $3.92 per share. This compares with the consensus estimates of $17.5 billion and $3.75, respectively. Strong demand for AI solutions and robust Red Hat Linux performance are driving the company’s software business growth. IBM stock surged over 8% post the results announcement. However, it seems to be fully valued now. IBM stock, with 45% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Strong demand trends for its software business has driven its stock price growth lately. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. IBM Revenue of $17.6 billion in Q4 reflected a 1% y-o-y growth, as a 10% growth in software sales was largely offset by an 8% decline in the infrastructure segment, a 1.1% fall in consulting sales, and a 2.5% decline in financing revenue. IBM’s core software operations remain a key driver of growth for the company. Within software, Data & AI solutions and Red Hat products have been leading the growth. While Data & AI sales were up 4%, Red Hat products saw a 16% y-o-y growth. IBM has been looking to capitalize on the rising demand for artificial intelligence in the enterprise space. It introduced – Watsonx – its core platform that enables enterprise clients to train, tune, validate, and deploy customized AI models for their businesses. IBM has said that client demand for AI solutions has been accelerating. The company’s generative AI business has secured $5 billion in bookings across its software and consulting segments. IBM also saw a 50 bps rise in adjusted operating margin to 60.6%. Slight growth in sales clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $3.92 per share, up 1% y-o-y. Looking forward, the company expects at least 5% top-line growth $13.5 billion in free cash flows in 2025. Separately, check out What's Happening With MSFT Stock? Looking at IBM stock, it surged over 8% in after market hours on Wednesday, Jan 29. Notably, IBM is one of a handful of stocks that have increased their value in each of the last four years, but that still wasn’t enough for it to consistently beat the market. Returns for the stock were 16% in 2021, 11% in 2022, 22% in 2023, and 39% in 2024. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and rise of DeepSeek, could IBM face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for IBM to reflect the latest results, we think the stock is fully valued. At its current levels of around $250, IBM is trading at 3.7x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of just 2.2x over the last five years. Now, a slight rise in valuation multiple seems justified, given the increased contribution of AI to the software growth, bolstering the company’s top and bottom-line growth. Still, we think investors will be better off waiting for a dip or pick other tech stocks, such as MSFT for robust long terms gains. While IBM stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how IBM’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

The Meta AI logo appears on a mobile phone with Meta AI visible on a tablet in this photo ... [+] illustration in Brussels, Belgium, on January 26, 2025. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) recently reported its Q4 results, with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. It reported sales of $48.4 billion and earnings of $8.02 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $47.0 billion and $6.77, respectively. The company continued to benefit from an increasing user base. However, its Q1 outlook was below expectations, and its stock seems to be fully valued. META stock, with 92% returns since the beginning of 2024, has significantly outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. The company’s AI investments have started to pay off with increasing user engagement, boding well for its stock. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $48.4 billion in Q4 reflected a 21% y-o-y rise, driven by a 6% rise in ad impressions and a 14% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.35 billion. Meta’s primary revenue stream comes from advertising across its family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp). The company is leveraging AI to enhance its ad targeting capabilities and is investing in AI-powered content generation. To support its AI initiatives, Meta is making substantial infrastructure investments, with projected capital expenditures between $60-65 billion for 2025. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 48%, up around 700 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $8.02 per share, up 50% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q1 revenue to be in the range of $39.5 billion to $41.8 billion. At the mid-point of this range, the sales are falling short of the street expectation of $41.7 billion. Separately, look at What's Happening With MSFT Stock? Despite a solid Q4 beat, META stock may not see any meaningful growth as investors will weigh the underwhelming Q1 outlook and high capital expenditures planned this year. Looking at the stock’s performance over a slightly longer period, the increase in META stock over the last four-years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, 194% in 2023, and 66% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the rise of AI in China, could META stock see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Meta Platforms to reflect the latest results, it seems to be fully valued. At its current levels of $690, META stock is trading at 29x trailing earnings of $23.86 per share, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 24x over the last two years. While a rise in valuation multiple for META seems justified given the solid advertising growth lately, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a risk as to whether the investment will be worth it and eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. While META stock looks fully valued, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

WEST BENGAL, INDIA - 2024/12/11: In this photo illustration, a Microsoft Azure logo is seen ... [+] displayed on a smartphone with a Microsoft logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Avishek Das/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently reported its Q2 fiscal 2025 results (fiscal ends in June), with revenues and earnings exceeding the street estimates. The company reported revenue of $69.6 billion and earnings of $3.23 per share, compared to the consensus estimates of $68.8 billion and $3.11, respectively. The company continued to benefit from increasing sales of Azure cloud computing services. However, the company’s outlook for the third quarter was below expectations, resulting in lower levels for MSFT post the results announcement. But, we think MSFT stock may have some room for growth after its recent dip. MSFT stock, with 19% returns since the beginning of 2024, has underperformed the S&P 500 index, up 27%. Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing sales growth rate has slowed lately, weighing on its stock price. If you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Microsoft’s revenue of $69.6 billion in Q2 was up 12% y-o-y. Looking at segments, Productivity and Business Processes sales were up 14% to $29.4 billion, driven by higher sales of Microsoft 365 products and LinkedIn solutions. Intelligent Cloud segment revenue was up 19% to $25.5 billion, led by Azure and other cloud offerings. Lastly, More Personal Computing sales were unchanged at $14.7 billion, as growth in Windows OEM and devices was offset by lower gaming sales. Microsoft saw Azure and cloud services growth of 31% — a slight slowdown from 33% in the previous quarter. The company’s AI-related revenue has reached an annual run rate of $13 billion. Not only did the company see higher sales, its operating margin of 45.5% in Q2 expanded by 190 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in earnings of $3.23 per share, up 10% y-o-y. Separately, look at – Buy, Sell, Or Hold META Stock At $690? Azure sales were lower than anticipated, and this didn’t sit well with the investors. Furthermore, the company’s outlook of $68.2 billion revenue in Q3 (at the mid-point of the provided range) is much lower than the consensus estimate of $69.8 billion. As such, MSFT stock is taking a hit post the results announcement. Even if we look at a slightly longer time frame, the increase in MSFT stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -28% in 2022, 58% in 2023, and 13% in 2024. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and the rise of DeepSeek, could MSFT face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2024 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? After its recent dip, we think that MSFT stock has some room for growth. We estimate Microsoft’s Valuation to be $485 per share, reflecting around 15% upside from its current levels. Our forecast is based on 37x expected earnings of $13.11 per share in 2025. While the current P/E ratio of 37x exceeds the stock’s two-year average of 32x, this higher valuation appears warranted given the anticipated earnings growth driven by expanding Cloud and AI contribution. While MSFT stock looks like it has some room for growth, it is helpful to see how Microsoft’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: After DeepSeek's R1 stuns the AI world, Alibaba responds with an allegedly more powerful model

In brief: Alibaba has struck back at rival DeepSeek with the surprise release of its new Qwen 2.5-Max model. The Chinese e-commerce titan claims its latest artificial intelligence offering surpasses the capabilities of DeepSeek's recently launched and highly-touted DeepSeek-V3. The timing of the Qwen 2.5-Max's debut is unusual, considering it arrived on the first day of the Lunar New Year holiday, when most Chinese workers are off. It illustrates just how severely DeepSeek's AI breakthrough has rattled the established players. We've seen the effect DeepSeek's breakthrough had on overseas rivals like OpenAI, leading to multiple posts on X by CEO Sam Altman and the massive $600 billion stock crash at Nvidia – the biggest single-day plunge for any public company ever. It's no surprise that DeepSeek's success also spurred powerful domestic Chinese tech giants to scramble for a response. Alibaba's counterpunch comes in the form of the new Qwen 2.5-Max. "Qwen 2.5-Max outperforms...almost across the board GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3 and LLaMa-3.1-405B," boasted Alibaba Cloud in its WeChat announcement, calling out some of the most advanced open-source AI models from the likes of OpenAI and Meta. Beyond DeepSeek's general AI capabilities, another factor that contributed to its popularity has been the extremely low costs of developing and running its models. This has even led investors to seriously question the massive spending on AI by US tech leaders. Likely taking that into account, Alibaba Cloud also emphasized Qwen 2.5-Max's efficiency in a blog post, highlighting that it was trained on over 20 trillion tokens while using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture that requires significantly fewer computational resources than usual approaches. Beyond Alibaba, TikTok parent ByteDance has responded with an updated version of its flagship AI, which it claims outperformed OpenAI's GPT-3.5 on certain benchmarks. An earlier version of DeepSeek also triggered an intense price war in China back in May. DeepSeek-V2's incredibly low cost of just 1 yuan (14 cents) per million tokens of data processed forced major cloud providers like Alibaba to slash their own AI model pricing by up to 97%. It's worth mentioning that, like DeepSeek, Alibaba's new Qwen 2.5-Max does seem to avoid discussing sensitive political topics related to China. Attempts to query it on such issues are reportedly met with messages about exceeding data quotas, even as it responds normally to other prompts.

DeepSeek privacy concerns have led to investigations being opened in both the US and Europe, and seen the app removed from the App Store in Italy. It seems likely the same will happen in other countries. Italian’s privacy regulator questioned whether the app complied with GDPR, a tough privacy law that applies across 30 different countries … DeepSeek is an AI chatbot developed in China, and which posted benchmarks indicating that its performance was comparable to the world’s best existing models. Experts quickly verified the claims, expressing shock that China was able to achieve this at a fraction of the development cost of US models, and running locally on very modestly-specced PCs. The app quickly climbed to the #1 slot in Apple’s App Store. It also led to fears that US AI companies may be over-valued. It had previously been thought that the very high hardware costs required to develop LLMs meant companies like OpenAI, Google and Meta were unlikely to face competition from smaller businesses, and that Nvidia GPUs would continue to be in extremely high demand. Those assumptions have now been thrown into question, leading to a slump in the stock price of a number of companies. Most AI chatbots have privacy policies which allow them to learn from our interactions with them, raising obvious privacy concerns. The fact that DeepSeek is Chinese owned has raised additional fears about how it collects and uses personal data. Reuters reports that Italy’s privacy watchdog has asked the company a series of questions about GDPR compliance, and has given it 20 days to respond. Italy’s data protection authority said it was seeking answers from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) model DeepSeek on its use of personal data. The Italian regulator, which is also known as the Garante, said it wanted to know what personal data is collected, from which sources, for what purposes, on what legal basis, and whether it is stored in China. Additionally, US officials are investigating the app. US officials are looking at the national security implications of the Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said […] The National Security Council is reviewing the app’s implications. Following the Garante’s questions, DeepSeek is no longer available in either Apple or Google’s app stores in the country. It’s not clear whether this action was taken by DeepSeek or by the app store companies. The Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek could not be accessed on Wednesday in Apple and Google app stores in Italy, the day after the country’s data protection authority requested information on its use of personal data. Reuters reports that Ireland’s privacy regulator has also asked similar questions. GDPR applies to all 27 European Union countries, plus three EAA ones, meaning that companies operating in a total of 30 countries are required to comply. A lack of satisfactory response to the questions asked by Italy and Ireland could potentially see the app banned in all these countries. The same privacy concerns apply to most generative AI services. Given their very similar privacy policies, it seems the only difference here is that US companies are trusted more than Chinese ones. The best advice is never to include personal data in your chatbot requests. Apple Intelligence is a notable exception to this: the service does not use your data for training purposes. Additionally, Apple’s deal with OpenAI means that ChatGPT is also banned from doing so when you access it as a fallback to Apple Intelligence. For this reason, accessing ChatGPT via Siri is the safest way to use it. Photo by Solen Feyissa on Unsplash FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: MicroStrategy Isn’t Just A Giant Bitcoin Bet–It’s A Revolution In Corporate Finance

New Year’s Eve at Villa Vecchia is a delirious blur of orange and gold, a scene straight out of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s most opulent fantasies. More than 500 people crowd onto the manicured lawns of the century-old Miami Beach estate with its Versailles-inspired ballroom that once welcomed luminaries including Margaret Thatcher, Henry Kissinger and Mikhail Gorbachev. Bitcoin’s recent surge past $100,000—not the dawn of 2025—is the real raison d’être for the bash. Servers glide around with champagne on silver trays, hors d’oeuvres are stamped with the omnipresent B and dancers in golden bodysuits undulate with glowing orange orbs in homage to bitcoin’s signature hue. At the center of the garden looms a massive playing card, the king’s face replaced with a brazen B. jamel toppin for forbes On the water, the party continues aboard the Usher. The 154-foot superyacht, which was featured in the 2015 film Entourage, glistens against the Miami skyline. A constant stream of shuttles disgorges an unending parade of bitcoin executives, influencers and, most importantly, institutional investors, all decked out in “bitcoin chic” (tangerine suits, B-logo bling). Two giant projectors flash clips forecasting bitcoin’s rise into the millions, while a DJ clad in a space helmet directs bass-heavy tracks between the swaying palms. “I kind of feel a little sick of winning,” quips one reveler in a black cap emblazoned with SATOSHI NAKAMOTO—the handle of bitcoin’s anonymous creator. The partygoers all have crypto cred: The guy in the Nakamoto hat is David Bailey, the 34-year old CEO of BTC Inc., publisher of Bitcoin Magazine, who hosted the Bitcoin Conference in July at which Donald Trump vowed to make America the “crypto capital of the planet” and establish a national bitcoin stockpile. Villa Vecchia’s owner and host, Michael Saylor, 59, moves through the revelry clad in his signature black blazer, blue jeans and T-shirt whose front sports (of course) a B. He graciously accepts handshakes and requests for selfies. Here, bitcoin is God—and Saylor is its prophet. Crypto is a second coming of sorts for Saylor, given that he made and lost more than $10 billion during the original dot-com bubble. Back then, MicroStrategy, the Tysons Corner, Virginia–based software firm he cofounded in 1989 fresh out of MIT, was in the data mining and business intelligence software business before running afoul of the Securities and Exchange Commission over its accounting practices. In 2000, the company paid a fine, settled with the feds and restated its results for the preceding couple years. Forbes For the next two decades MicroStrategy languished with tepid sales and a market cap hovering around $1 billion. That all changed in 2020, when Saylor decided that going all in on bitcoin would be MicroStrategy’s core strategy. Last year, after the SEC approved bitcoin ETFs from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, the crypto­currency’s price skyrocketed, more than doubling over 12 months and breaking through $100,000 in early December. Just before Christmas, Micro­Strategy joined the Nasdaq 100, spurring even more demand for its stock, which is up more than 700% in the last year, as it issued debt and accumulated more bitcoin (it now owns 471,107). Saylor’s company is now the largest holder of the digital asset outside of the elusive Nakamoto, who is said to hold 1 million tokens. During 2024, Saylor’s net worth jumped from $1.9 billion to $7.6 billion. A month into the new year he is worth $9.4 billion. MicroStrategy’s eye-popping gains have stirred up a swarm of critics and short sellers unable to fathom how a tiny software company holding only $48 billion in actual bitcoin could have a market capitalization of $84 billion. But what Saylor’s detractors fail to understand is that Micro­Strategy is brilliantly straddling two realms: one bound by the rules of traditional finance, in which companies issue debt and equity bought and sold by hedge funds, traders and other institutions, and the second governed by the faithful, unwavering believers in a better world brought to you by bitcoin. The fuel propelling MicroStrategy’s success is its embrace and cultivation of volatility, the defining characteristic of its core asset. Volatility is anathema to traditional investors, but it’s a great friend of the options traders, hedge funds and retail speculators that have helped make Micro­Strategy among the most active stocks in the market. With its relatively tiny annual revenue of $496 million, it has a daily trading volume that rivals that of any of the Magnificent 7 tech giants (Meta, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Nvidia). “People think that’s crazy,” Saylor says. “How can such a small company have that liquidity? It’s because we put a crypto reactor in the middle of the company, pull capital in and then we spin it. That puts volatility in the equity, and that makes our options and convertible bonds the most interesting and highest-performing in the market.” Michael Saylor is 100 percent correct when it comes to the desirability of the $7.3 billion in convertible bonds his company has issued since 2021. Every minute of the trading day, MicroStrategy’s stock price is being amplified in real time by bitcoin’s constant gyrations, increasing what’s known as the implied volatility of the call option inherent in its convertible bonds. That’s because unlike straight bonds, convertibles give debt holders safety, with the option of exchanging their notes for Micro­Strategy stock at predetermined prices until maturity. Every trader schooled in the Black-Scholes options pricing formula knows that high implied volatility increases the value of an option. Thus Saylor has been able to issue his convertible debt at almost no interest cost. So far MicroStrategy’s six convertible notes, issued with maturities from 2027 to 2032, have interest rates ranging from 0% to 2.25%. In public bond markets, where liquidity has been shrinking thanks to the boom in private credit, institutional investors are starving for excess returns. MicroStrategy’s bonds not only represent one of the only ways big investors like German insurer Allianz and State Street can invest in digital assets, but they’ve also been one of the market’s top performers, clocking returns in excess of 250% since issuance. Even the $3 billion five-year notes MicroStrategy issued in November, with their 0% coupon and strike price of $672 (80% above MicroStrategy’s current share price) are up 89% in just a few months. Saylor understands that institutional investors, who are measured against quarterly benchmarks, will keep buying his high-octane paper to boost their portfolio returns. Issuing huge amounts of convertible bonds, as MicroStrategy has, is normally dilutive for a company’s stock, but in this case it has had a bullish effect because the notes represent future stock demand at increasingly higher prices. Through secondary offerings and convertible issuance, MicroStrategy’s outstanding shares have grown since 2020 from 97 million to 246 million. Over the same period, its stock has appreciated 2,666%. In late January, its shareholders voted to vastly increase the company’s authorized shares to 10.3 billion. The cycle feeds itself: Issue billions in low- or no-cost debt and equity, drive bitcoin pri­ces higher with large purchases and catapult MicroStrategy’s hyper­volatile stock. Rinse and repeat. “What they found is a monetary glitch in the financial markets that they’re taking advantage of,” marvels Richard Byworth, former conver­tible bonds trader at Nomura and managing partner at Zurich, Switzerland–based alternative investment firm Syz Capital. Saylor is understandably unabashed in his hyping of bitcoin. Last August he invented an entirely new financial metric dubbed Bitcoin Yield or BTC Yield. This sort of “yield” has nothing to do with any income being generated but simply measures the percentage change in the ratio of the company’s bitcoin holdings to the company’s fully diluted shares over time. His initial targets for the measure were 4% to 8% growth annually, but in January MicroStrategy reported a BTC Yield of 48% for Q4 and 74.3% for all of 2024—big but meaningless numbers he has fed like chum to his adoring followers. Try to put a value on MicroStrategy the old-fashioned way and you’ll lose your marbles, according to Ben Werkman, a former commercial banker, consultant and early investor in the company’s bitcoin strategy. Saylor “turned off the income statement thinking and said ‘We’re going to attack the net worth side of the company, focus on leveraging the strength that we have on our balance sheet,’ and in this case, that means acquiring more bitcoin.” Which is exactly what MicroStrategy is doing. In October, Saylor unveiled a plan called “21/21” to raise a whopping $42 billion—half through equity, half through debt—over the next three years to buy more bitcoin. In November and December alone, the firm scooped up nearly 200,000 coins worth roughly $18 billion. It all works out brilliantly as long as the price of bitcoin keeps rising, but what if it collapses, as it has many times before? “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. MicroStrategy is singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market.” Unless it’s a true apocalypse, MicroStrategy should be okay. Bitcoin would need to fall by more than 80% from its current $100,000-plus level and stay that way for at least two years for Micro­Strategy to fall short on its ability to cover its current debt obligations. Here again Saylor has shown genius in exploiting the capital markets and the behavior of bond investors. All of the $7 billion in debt MicroStrategy has issued is unsecured and not technically backed by any of the bitcoin in its coffers. Moreover, at the company’s current stock price of $373, more than $4 billion of its debt is already “in the money” or, effectively, equity. “Actually, there is very little debt on Micro­Strategy’s balance sheet,” says Jeff Park, head of alpha strategies at Bitwise, a San Francisco–based crypto asset manager, noting that a forced liquidation of MicroStrategy’s bitcoin holdings would be unlikely because institutional bondholders have high tolerance for refinancings, even in worst-case bankruptcy scenarios. What is stopping other companies from copying Saylor’s bitcoin-fueled financial engineering? Nothing. And many are starting to do exactly that. According to Park, Bitwise counts about 90 public companies, including well-known names Tesla and Block, that have added bitcoin to their balance sheets. In March, his company will launch the Bitwise Bitcoin Standard Corporations ETF, which will be a bitcoin holdings-weighted index of 35 public companies in possession of at least 1,000 bitcoin (roughly $100 million) in their treasuries. MicroStrategy will domi­nate the index. The copycats are giving ammunition to Micro­Strategy haters. “The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over,” according to Kerrisdale Capital, a Miami-based investment firm that issued a short thesis on the stock in March. But Park argues that like Netflix in streaming, Micro­Strategy’s first-mover advantage and size set it apart. “Size is everything because liquidity is everything. They are singularly the most liquid source to trade bitcoin-related risks, both by the spot market and, more importantly, the options market,” Park says. “The options market for Micro­Strategy is by far the deepest single name options market in the entire world.” MicroStrategy’s frenetic options have even spawned a fund called YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, which sells call options to generate income. The year-old fund has an annual yield of 106% and has already amassed $1.9 billion in assets. Sitting by the pool at Villa Vecchia, with his crypto-named parrots Hodl, Satoshi and Max chattering away in the background, Saylor waves off his critics. “Conventional wisdom in business for the last 40 years was that capital is a liability and volatility is bad. The bitcoin standard dictates capital is an asset and volatility is good—it’s a feature,” he insists. “They’re living in flatland, a pre-Copernican world. We’re on a train going 60 miles an hour, spinning a gyro with a 30-ton weight on it, and the rest of the world is standing by the side of the track, stationary.” This isn’t the first time Michael Saylor has flown close to the sun. He was born in 1965 on an Air Force base in Lincoln, Nebraska, and his early years were steeped in military discipline. His father, a chief master sergeant, moved the family between Air Force bases around the world before settling near Wright-Patterson in Ohio—home of the Wright Brothers’ aviation school—where Saylor gradua­ted high school as valedictorian and class marshal, voted “most likely to succeed” by his peers. He went on to study aeronautics and astronautics at MIT on a full Air Force ROTC scholarship and wrote a thesis on a computer simulation of a Renaissance Italian city-state. In his free time, he played guitar in a rock band and flew gliders. He graduated in 1987 with highest honors and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Force, but his dream of becoming a fighter pilot was grounded by a heart murmur, which turned out to be a misdiagnosis. At age 24, he cofounded MicroStrategy with his MIT fraternity brother Sanju Bansal. The company tapped into data analytics at a time when few understood that discipline’s potential. Riding the dot-com wave, the company went public in 1998, and by 2000, its market cap soared past $24 billion. With his net worth rising to a peak of nearly $14 billion, Saylor became a tech evangelist heralding a world in which data would flow “like water.” “We’re going to use our technology to obliterate entire supply chains,” Saylor told Forbes in late 1998. “We’re playing for all the marbles to essentially win the entire industry worldwide, forever.” Then came the crash. On March 10, 2000, Micro­Strategy’s stock hit a peak of $313 per share—more than 60 times its IPO price. Within two weeks it plummeted to $72, following the company’s announcement that it would need to restate its financial results. The SEC accused Saylor and others of accounting fraud, charges MicroStrategy later settled for $11 million. Within two years its stock price had fallen below $1. Saylor’s $13 billion fortune evaporated. “It was the darkest part of my life,” he says. “When people lose money because they believe in you, that’s pretty much the worst.” In 2020, after the government followed years of quantitative easing with trillions of dollars in Covid-19-related stimulus, Saylor became convinced that the best use for the remaining $530 million in cash and short-term investments on MicroStrategy’s balance sheet was investing in bitcoin. The U.S. government could print as many dollars as it wanted—and it was hard at work doing just that—but, by design, bitcoin comes with a hard cap: There will never be more than 21 million in existence. If the price of bitcoin plummets, MicroStrategy’s stock will fall harder and faster than the token itself. But be careful about dismissing Saylor as yet another too-smart-for-his-own good entrepreneur gone off the rails. Many others are following the lead of MicroStrategy—which now bills itself “the world’s first and largest Bitcoin Treasury.” Some public companies, like Metaplanet, owe their very survival to bitcoin. The Tokyo-based hotel chain faced an existential crisis during the pandemic when Japan closed its borders to tourists. The small hotelier sold all but one of its ten properties and issued shares and debt to finance $70 million in bitcoin purchases. Metaplanet’s shares, which trade on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and over the counter, gained 2,600% in 2024, and its market capitalization is now $1 billion, despite holding only $183 million worth of bitcoin. The company’s homepage now reads “Secure the Future with Bitcoin” and barely mentions hotels. “We owe a lot to Michael Saylor for the business plan, which he has created for the rest of the world to follow,” says Simon Gerovich, CEO of Metaplanet and a guest at Saylor’s New Year’s bash. “I invented 20 things, tried to make them successful and really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared. It’s made me more successful than every one of my ideas.” It is unlikely many corporations will go to Metaplanet’s extreme, but more bitcoin converts are almost a certainty. In January, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changed a rule that previously permitted companies to record crypto value declines only as losses in quarterly reports, so that now holdings will be marked to market, allowing for reversal of losses and gains as well. For MicroStrategy, which lobbied for the change, it’s likely to mean numerous profitable quarters ahead—and possible inclusion in the S&P 500. Today hundreds of sizable public companies around the world are sitting on more than twice the cash they need to finance current operations and liabilities, according to data from YCharts. Most prominent among them is Berkshire Hathaway, which currently holds $320 billion in cash. Given the $35 trillion (and growing) national debt, Saylor’s mantra has long been “cash is trash.” “Financial repression is an eternal phenomenon,” insists Bitwise’s Park, referring to the inevitability of government-induced lower interest rates. “We are living in this hyper-financialized world where the real economy has fundamentally detached itself from the financial economy. You actually can’t service the level of debt without printing more money, and if you believe you have to continue printing more money, then you better believe there’s going to be yield curve repression.” For Saylor, Villa Vecchia itself is Exhibit A. The 18,000-square-foot mansion on Miami’s “Millionaire’s Row” was built for the president of F.W. Woolworth in 1928; Saylor bought it for $13 million in 2012. This house “was $100,000 in 1930. It was appraised at $46 million a few years ago,” said Saylor during a 2023 podcast interview. “Do the calculation—it’s on a path to be worth $100 million, which means that the U.S. dollar will have lost 99.9% of its value over 100 years. The bottom line is: Your money in the bank isn’t money.” The coming Trump years are likely to be good for MicroStrategy and bitcoin. Despite all his bluster about “government efficiency,” Trump was a huge spendthrift during his first presidency: In the four years of Trump 1.0, the national debt increased by $8.4 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And although he famously called bitcoin a “scam” competing against the dollar in 2021, Trump is all in on crypto these days. In fact, his son Eric recently posted a picture with Saylor at Mar-a-Lago captioned “Two friends, one passion: bitcoin.” Not only is the value of the dollar likely to further erode over the next four years, but Saylor’s relentless proselytizing aligns perfectly with the dystopian MAGA worldview. “The human condition has been plagued by dirt: toxic food, toxic liquid, and the economic condition of the human race has been plagued by toxic capital. I’m on a mission to evangelize nontoxic capital for the world,” he preaches. But even Michael Saylor occasionally steps down from his soapbox to reflect on his corporate journey. “We adopted bitcoin out of frustration and desperation, and then it became an opportunity, and then it became a strategy, and then it became an identity, and then it became a mission,” he says. “The irony of my career is I invented 20 things, and I tried to make them successful, and I really didn’t change the world with any of them. Satoshi created one thing, gave it to the world and disappeared, and now we just carry the torch. That, ironically, has made me more successful than me trying to commercialize every one of my own ideas. It is a lesson in humility.” And a reminder that lightning can indeed strike the same place twice, especially when there is a shrewd and opportunistic steward at the helm.

Title: DeepSeek disruption: Is the Nvidia sell-off an overreaction? (Prakash Bhudia)
URL: https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/27738/deepseek-disruption-is-the-nvidia-sell-off-an-overreaction
Time Published: 2025-01-30T07:47:30Z
Full Content:
The release of DeepSeek’s groundbreaking R1 AI model has sent shockwaves through global markets, wiping $1 trillion from tech stocks and prompting a significant sell-off in Nvidia shares. DeepSeek’s claims of building a rival AI model at a fraction of the cost compared to U.S. tech giants have sparked fears about the future of AI infrastructure spending. But is the panic justified, or are investors overreacting? DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, recently unveiled its R1 model, a reasoning-focused AI that rivals OpenAI’s latest advancements. The company claims to have trained the model for just $5.6 million in rented GPU hours, a figure that starkly contrasts with the billions spent by U.S. firms like OpenAI and Meta. This efficiency has raised questions about whether Nvidia’s high-end GPUs are as essential as previously thought. However, some analysts and industry insiders remain skeptical. Machine learning researcher Nathan Lampert pointed out that DeepSeek’s $5.6 million figure likely excludes significant pre-training costs, engineering salaries, and infrastructure expenses, potentially pushing their actual costs closer to $500 million or more. Source: DeepSeekV3 Additionally, there’s speculation that DeepSeek has access to restricted Nvidia H100 chips, adding a layer of complexity to its cost-efficiency claims. Despite these doubts, the open-source nature of DeepSeek’s techniques means its efficiency breakthroughs could be replicated by other players, potentially reshaping the economics of AI development. Nvidia, which has dominated the AI hardware market with its cutting-edge GPUs, saw a sharp drop in its stock value following DeepSeek’s announcement. Investors worry that DeepSeek’s efficiency could dampen demand for Nvidia’s GPUs, especially as Big Tech reevaluates its AI spending strategies. But the narrative may not be so dire. Industry leaders like Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella have invoked the Jevons Paradox, arguing that as AI becomes more efficient, demand for computing power could actually increase. Ethan Mollick, a Wharton professor specializing in AI, echoed this sentiment, noting that greater efficiency allows companies to serve more customers and expand AI applications, ultimately driving higher demand for GPUs. Moreover, AI giants like OpenAI and Meta have recently announced massive infrastructure investments, signaling a continued appetite for high-performance hardware. Meta’s $65 billion capital expenditure plan for 2025, for instance, includes building an AI data center nearly the size of Manhattan. These commitments underscore the long-term growth potential for Nvidia, even in the face of new competitors. The market’s reaction to DeepSeek’s R1 model reflects both the promise and the uncertainty of AI’s rapidly evolving landscape. While DeepSeek’s efficiency claims could shift how AI models are built, they are unlikely to eliminate the need for advanced hardware entirely. Nvidia’s diversified portfolio, which includes robotics and AI-driven applications, positions it well to weather these disruptions. For investors, the key question is whether DeepSeek’s innovations mark the beginning of a broader trend or a temporary market overreaction. If history is any guide, breakthroughs that lower costs often lead to expanded markets rather than shrinking them. Nvidia, as a leader in AI hardware, could still emerge as a major beneficiary in the long run. In the short term, the market may continue to grapple with the implications of DeepSeek’s rise. But with AI demand showing no signs of slowing, Nvidia’s upside could be far from over. At the time of writing Nvidia is recovering from an early week slump, with some upside pressure clearly evident on the daily chart. However, prices remaining below the moving average If a significant bounce materialises, buyers could face a hurdle at the $140.00 and $148.80 resistance levels. On the downside, sellers could find support at the $121.80 price level.

Title: Alibaba Unveils Qwen 2.5 AI Model, Claiming It Outperforms DeepSeek And ChatGPT, But It Remains To Be Seen How It Will Be Positioned In The Industry

Time Published: 2025-01-30T07:27:19Z

DeepSeek has shaken the AI industry with its new R1 model, which aims to compete against OpenAI's ChatGPT. While the Chinese AI chatbot is all the hype these days, another major contender has entered the competition, claiming that its AI model is better than that of DeepSeek. Alibaba has officially launched its Qwen 2.5 AI model and claims that it can outperform DeepSeek-V3 along with other leading AI models like ChatGPT. DeepSeek entered the AI industry earlier this week with its new AI model, and it has surpassed ChatGPT to become the most downloaded AI chatbot in various regions, including the United States. With Alibaba stepping into the same field, we can safely presume that China is desperate to take the lead in the category. According to Alibaba's cloud division, “Qwen 2.5-Max surpasses GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Llama-3.1-405B in almost every aspect,” referring to the dominance against Meta and OpenAI (via Reuters). The rapid development of new AI models has intensified the competition in the industry, and the race to become number one has impacted investor confidence in the United States. Companies like NVIDIA have also lost their position in the stock market, making investors reassess their investments in major AI tech giants in the United States. DeepSeek's success in the industry is making rivals step up their game to better compete against the new entrants. Furthermore, existing companies have also released updated AI models to showcase their newer capabilities. For instance, ByteDance unveiled its upgraded AI model and claims it outperforms OpenAI's o1 in AIME, a key benchmark measuring AI comprehension and understanding of complex instructions. With Alibaba's new Qwen 2.5 AI model, we expect the competition to pick up additional heat, which will be evident in the coming months. The previous version of the DeepSeek-V3 also waged a price war for AI models in China. Since DeepSeek-V2 was open source and relatively cheap compared to the competition, with an estimated $0.14 for a million tokens, it led Alibaba to slash its prices by 97 percent on a wide range of AI models. Baidu and Tencent followed suit and cut their prices as well. We have to take note that DeepSeek only has a handful of users compared to Alibaba's hundreds of thousands of employees. Moreover, it only took $5.6 million for DeepSeek to develop the new AI technology against billions of dollars spent in the United States. It remains to be seen how Alibaba's Qwen performs against the likes of DeepSeek and OpenAI and how the company is planning to position itself in the market.

Business FILE PHOTO: Pedestrians walk past a Microsoft Experience Center, following a global IT outage, in New York City, U.S. July 19, 2024. REUTERS/Kent J. Edwards/File Photo :Investors punished Microsoft with a 4 per cent share drop on Thursday as hefty AI bets failed to drive a big increase in its cloud revenue, while Meta rose 2 per cent after CEO Mark Zuckerberg assured Wall Street about growth with promises of a "really big year". The chief executives of both the companies defended their heavy investments on artificial intelligence on Wednesday, days after Chinese upstart DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap AI that shook the technology industry. But while Meta has consistently showed strong ad revenues - a move that "easily justifies" its investments according to Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney - Microsoft's key cloud business Azure has been slowing down. The Windows maker missed market estimates for quarterly revenue growth at Azure and gave a third-quarter forecast for the business that was below expectations, even after it promised a rebound for the unit in the second half of its fiscal year. "The second-half re-acceleration story for Azure is not playing out," Barclays analyst Raimo Lenschow said. "The company overly focused on AI workloads at the expense of core Azure. It will take time to fix this, which means the Azure growth acceleration the market had been hoping for has to wait for a little longer." For Facebook-parent Meta, a better-than-expected 21 per cent jump in revenue helped ease investor fears around Zuckerberg's plans to spend as much as $65 billion this year on AI, even as its first-quarter forecast was muted. "Nobody is more bulled up on AI than Meta. And Meta might have more benefits to show from AI than anyone," Rosenblatt analyst Barton Crockett wrote. At least 15 brokerages raised their price targets on Meta, which has a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 26.22. The stock jumped 65 per cent last year, the biggest gain among Big Tech peers. The company looked set to add $29 billion to its market value of $1.71 trillion on Thursday. "Meta's ability to use AI to sustainably drive both engagement and pricing growth is a rarity in its (and the industry's) history," MoffettNathanson analysts said. Microsoft was on track to erase about $136 billion off its $3.29 trillion market cap. About four brokerages trimmed their price targets on the stock, which has lagged its peers with just a 12 per cent gain last year. Microsoft "did not recommit to (its Azure second-half outlook) the same way that it did 90 days ago. The Azure-acceleration story has been hit by shrapnel and is losing altitude," J.P. Morgan analyst Mark Murphy said.

Title: Microsoft’s AI revenue grows, but its stock falls on lower guidance and concerns over spending

UPDATED 18:41 EST / JANUARY 29 2025 by Mike Wheatley Microsoft Corp. said today that profit from its fiscal second quarter rose 10% from the same period a year ago as it strives to capitalize on the massive investments it has made in artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company said its revenue from AI products and related services has now hit an annual run rate of $13 billion, growing from the previous $10 billion run rate it reported three months ago. However, while its profit and revenue surpassed Wall Street’s expectations, the company’s overall cloud computing business fell just short of analyst’s targets. Moreover, its guidance for the current quarter came up short, sending its stock lower after-hours. Microsoft reported earnings before certain costs such as stock compensation of $3.23 per share, besting Wall Street’s forecast of $3.11. Revenue from the October to December quarter reached $69.63 billion, above the Street’s $68.78 billion target. The company published its fiscal 2025 second-quarter earnings report in the wake of larger questions about spending in the AI industry following the emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has achieved dramatic cost-efficiency gains through the use of novel AI training techniques. DeepSeek’s rise has led to some serious scrutiny over the billions of dollars spent on AI infrastructure by Microsoft and its rivals. In the quarter, Microsoft’s capital expenditures reached a new record high of $22.6 billion, with officials citing the need to continue boosting data center capacity to meet demand for its AI offerings and cloud customers. The company said revenue from its Azure cloud computing platform and other cloud services increased 31% in the quarter, a slower pace than the 33% growth recorded three months earlier. Officials said 13% of that growth was attributed to AI services. Azure’s overall growth rate was lower than analysts had expected, and that caused Microsoft’s stock to fall more than 4% in extended trading. Overall, the company’s Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes revenue from Azure, delivered $25.54 billion in sales, up 19% from a year earlier but just shy of the $25.83 billion consensus estimate. Elsewhere, the company’s productivity segment, which includes the Office suite and Teams messenger platform, added $29.4 billion in revenue, up 14% from a year earlier. Sales from the personal computing business, which includes Windows, remained flat at $14.7 billion. Looking to the current quarter, Microsoft’s chief financial officer Amy Hood said on a conference call that the company is looking at sales of between $67.7 billion and $68.7 billion, shy of the Street’s consensus of $69.8 billion. She’s forecasting Azure revenue to grow by 31% to 32%, below the Street’s guidance of 33.4%, blaming it on the need to address execution challenges and problems with capacity constraints. However, Hood said she’s confident that Azure’s growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year, compared to the first half. The latest revenue numbers highlight the rapid pace of Microsoft’s ongoing transition from a product-focused business to a services one, said Holger Mueller of Constellation Research Inc. He pointed out how product revenue declined more than $2.5 billion in the quarter compared to the previous year, though services-based revenue made up for it, growing more than $10 billion. But the successful transition is creating new problems for the company, he said. “The result of this is that earnings per share were up 30 cents year-over-year, but the question on investor’s lips is how long can the company keep this up,” Mueller said. “They’ll be concerned by the comments from Hood, who acknowledged Azure is facing capacity constraints for the first time.” Although the company’s stock fell slightly after-hours, it was still higher than it was on Monday, when it was hit by a broader selloff of technology stocks that was driven by the reaction of ChatGPT competitor DeepSeek. Microsoft’s stock had slipped more than 4% at the start of the week as investors mulled the implications of DeepSeek’s competing models. The Chinese company debuted an open-source “reasoning” model earlier this month that it said was trained at a cost of just $5.6 million, excluding the expense of data and previous research. That sent shockwaves through the AI industry, as its performance matched and sometimes even outperformed comparable models created by OpenAI, Google LLC and Meta Platforms Inc., which cost much more to train. Microsoft is a key backer of OpenAI and it has committed to spending $80 billion on AI infrastructure this year in order to expand its global network of high-powered data centers to meet demand for the specialized chips required to train and run AI models. Somewhat surprisingly, Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella (pictured) said DeepSeek’s R1 model is now available to download through the Azure AI Foundry platform and via GitHub. He added that customers will soon be able to select DeepSeek on Copilot+ personal computers. Regarding DeepSeek’s perceived cost-efficiency gains, Nadella told analysts on the call that “scaling laws” are compounding with regards to both pretraining and inference time compute. “We ourselves have seen significant efficiency gains in both training and inference for years now,” he said. “On inference, we have typically seen more than two-times price-performance gains for every new hardware generation and more than 10-times for every new model generation.” The rise of DeepSeek has stoked fears among some investors that Microsoft may have put its eggs in the wrong basket by throwing its weight behind OpenAI and the infrastructure that supports it, said Valoir analyst Rebecca Wettemann. “We don’t expect companies to move their AI to DeepSeek yet, but that company’s release of lower-cost and less resource-intensive AI models tells us that AI is going to become more commoditized in future,” Wettemann said. “It’s the surrounding platform features that support greater accuracy, security and customization to specific needs that will be the real differentiators, and that’s where Microsoft needs to invest.” Prior to today’s earnings call, Microsoft’s stock had gained 5% in the year to date, outperforming the S&P 500 Index, which was up 3% so far.

Title: Zuckerberg promises 'a pivotal year for the metaverse' as its Reality Labs division continues to bleed cash

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Meta's Reality Labs division continues to bleed billions of dollars — crossing $60 billion in losses since 2020. "This is also going to be a pivotal year for the metaverse," Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg confidently told investors on Wednesday. The unit, responsible for its virtual reality headset line "Quest" and its Ray-Ban smart glasses, reported a loss of $5 billion in its Q4 earnings (totaling $17.7 billion in 2024). Its revenue slightly rose 1% year over year to $1.08 billion, driven by hardware sales. Expenses jumped to $6 billion, up 5% year over year. "The number of people using Quest and Horizon has been steadily growing, and this is a year when a number of the long-term investments that we've been working on that will make the metaverse more visually stunning and inspiring will really start to land," Zuckerberg said on the earnings call. Analysts told Yahoo Finance it's questionable whether Zuckerberg's metaverse will ever clock a profit. "There are going to be other ways Meta can monetize its investment down the road but it does look very expensive — like a loss leader in the short term," Moor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag told Yahoo Finance. "AR is a very expensive technology to develop and I believe most of the money that matters spending in Reality Labs is on AR efforts." A leaked memo earlier this week claimed Reality Labs has hit its sales and user targets. However, current and former employees within the division exclusively tell Yahoo Finance that hitting targets is a small piece of the puzzle. "If their losses are going up and the sales are going up, the question they need to ask themselves is why does the hardware cost so much to make and why aren't they working harder to bring the cost down," said one former Reality Labs manager. "They haven't figured out how to make this profitable and they're not even close." According to market intelligence firm IDC Global, Meta continues to dominate the VR/AR market with a 70% share. "True Augmented Reality headsets such as Meta’s Orion will take time to gain salience as these headsets require high levels of sophistication paired with battery and display tech that are yet to scale," IDC said in its report. Meta's stock has been up 68% in the past year, partially due to the booming investor enthusiasm for AI. Last week, Zuckerberg announced that Meta is planning to spend $60 billion to $65 billion on its artificial intelligence strategy — including a data center "so large it would cover a significant part of Manhattan." Wall Street was stopped in its tracks on Monday following the launch of an AI model by Chinese startup DeepSeek, which claimed its large language model was built in two months with less than $6 million. According to reports, Meta set up four war rooms to analyze DeepSeek's technology, two of which focused on reducing training costs. DeepSeek's R1 model now raises a question for analysts: Does Meta need to spend up to $65 billion to deploy AI software? "There's going to be an open-source standard globally and I think for our national advantage it's important that its an American standard," Zuckerberg said. "If anything, some of the recent news has only strengthened our conviction that this the right thing for us to be focused on." "Mark Zuckerberg clearly set expectations that clarity will come to the trajectories of Meta’s long-term initiatives, which includes the metaverse," Forrester's research director Mike Proulx told Yahoo Finance. "While Meta is likely to succeed with its open-source approach to AI, there’s simply nothing to point to in Horizon Worlds that portends success with the metaverse. Despite the company’s name, Meta’s North Star is, and should be, AI." In a note to investors this week, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill expressed optimism about Meta's AI efforts, maintaining a Buy rating and setting a price target of $715. “Overall, we continue to be encouraged by Meta’s ability to sustain DD rev growth, given the combination of higher engagement from AI investments, increased advertiser efficiency, and ramping of incremental monetization formats (e.g. WhatsApp & Llama),” Thill said in the note. Meta's earnings came later than usual. Despite Zuckerberg cozying up to the Trump administration, the Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump signed an agreement calling for Meta to pay $25 million to settle a 2021 lawsuit Trump brought on after his Facebook and Instagram accounts were suspended. According to the report, $22 million of the settlement will go toward a fund set up for Trump's presidential library. A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 168.61 points, or 0.38%, closing at 44,882.13. At its session highs, it had added nearly 300 points. The S&P 500 rose 0.53% to 6,071.17, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 0.25% to end at 19,681.75. Stocks cut gains late in the session after President Donald Trump announced his intention to implement 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico. Elsewhere, Wall Street digested recent quarterly results from a slew of megacap tech companies. Shares of Meta Platforms and Tesla respectively added 1.6% and 2.9%, while Microsoft shares dipped 6.2% after the companies reported earnings. Meta beat on top and bottom lines, but Microsoft shares faltered after the company's quarterly revenue forecast disappointed. Tesla shrugged off an earnings and revenue miss. "We had three major megacap technology companies report last night and for the most part, all of them sort of came in and out of their earnings unscathed," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management. "That's a positive when you look at the aggregate number of companies that have reported and how many companies are beating expectations both on the top and bottom lines." On the other hand, investors were a bit cautious to buy after fourth-quarter GDP growth came in at just 2.3%, missing expectations. Wall Street is coming off a losing session after the Federal Reserve paused its interest rate-cutting campaign, leaving its borrowing rate unchanged in a range between 4.25% and 4.5%. In their postmeeting statement, policymakers noted that inflation remains "somewhat elevated." "We kind of get the chance to put the Fed not cutting rates in the rearview mirror because they're likely doing that for the right reasons, meaning the economic data seems consistent with keeping rates unchanged for the time being," Hogan said. "This also gives them time to look at policy from the new administration and try to model out what kind of impact that will have on both the economy and inflation." Other "Magnificent Seven" names are set to report in the coming days, with Apple's results being due for a Thursday release. Amazon will soon follow suit, as the megacap tech company reports next week. Investors are also looking ahead to Friday's personal consumption expenditures price index report for December. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite are on pace to end the week in negative territory, despite making up some of their losses from Monday's sell-off. The blue-chip Dow is the only major index tracking for a weekly gain. The U.S. dollar rose against other currencies Thursday afternoon after President Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index turned positive on the day after the comments, trading at 108.07. The index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was trading near 107.76 before the remarks. The dollar also rose against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso individually. — Jesse Pound The major averages cut gains late in the day after President Donald Trump said he would slap a 25% tariff on goods from Mexico and Canada, two key U.S. trade partners. The Dow, which was up nearly 300 points at one point, briefly turned negative before rebounding. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were also off their highs. — Fred Imbert After monitoring Robert Kennedy Jr.'s confirmation hearings, Citi analyst Geoff Meacham told clients that he expects vaccine-exposed stocks such as Merck and Pfizer will experience some relief after the nominee said he would not deprioritize vaccine approvals at the Food and Drug Administration. Kennedy is hoping to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, but is known for controversial views on vaccinations and for his criticism of ultraprocessed foods. During the hearings, Kennedy voiced support for gene therapies and called GLP-1 treatments "miracle drugs" for those with morbid obesity. Merck and Pfizer shares were up less than 1% in trading Thursday, but GLP-1 drugmakers Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly had a bit more momentum. Both stocks were up around 2%. All four stocks have underperformed the S&P 500 since President Donald Trump was elected. Kennedy said he does not believe GLP-1 drugs, which include Wegovy and Zepbound, should be the first treatment used for obesity in children. He also expressed concern over the cost of the drugs. — Christina Cheddar Berk Hasbro and Mattel shares have had a strong start to the new year, rising 6% and 7% year to date, respectively. There may be a good reason for that. Data tracker Circana said global toy sales stabilized last year. The industry's shift to focus on collectibles and adults is helping to plug the gap created by declining birth rates, Circana said. Across the G12 nations, sales fell 0.6% year over year. Average selling price was flat, after four straight years of growth. In the U.S., dollar sales were flat from 2023. In 2023, dollar sales fell 7% in the U.S. from the prior year. Building sets, which include the popular Lego brand, showed both the biggest total sales and the greatest growth rate. Lego has expanded its offerings to include building sets that resonate with adults, who see the toys as a fun way to unwind. "This year we expect the global toy market to be positively impacted by the box office and popular series' on streaming platforms, continuing to fuel young and mature consumer appetites for toys and collectible merchandise," said Frederique Tutt, global toys industry advisor. Hasbro shares are up 17% over the past 12 months, while Mattel logged a nearly 5% gain during the same period. — Christina Cheddar Berk Comcast shares tracked for their worst session in more than a decade and a half as subscriber numbers disappointed Wall Street. Shares of the telecommunications giant, which owns CNBC parent NBCUniversal, tumbled more than 12% in afternoon trading. If that holds through Thursday's closing bell, it will mark the biggest one-day loss for the stock since October 2008, when shares plunged more than 14%. Thursday's sell-off comes after the Philadelphia-based company posted higher losses in broadband subscribers than previously expected. Comcast also reported fewer paid subscriptions to the Peacock streaming service than analysts polled by StreetAccount anticipated. Those stats overshadowed a strong quarterly report, with the company surpassing analysts' forecasts on both lines in the fourth quarter. — Alex Harring, Lillian Rizzo Disclosure: Comcast owns NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC. As crypto becomes increasingly tied into the financial mainstream, crypto-native companies are starting to launch some more traditional products of their own. On Thursday, Grayscale launched a Bitcoin Miners ETF (MRNS). While Grayscale's other exchange-traded funds hold cryptocurrency directly, the new fund is an equity-only fund, similar to traditional sector or thematic funds that have been around for years. "The work of Bitcoin Miners is integral to the existence and continuation of the Bitcoin network. As adoption of Bitcoin grows, we believe the Bitcoin Mining industry will only increase in value. For investors interested in Bitcoin-adjacent opportunities, or looking for an equity expression of Bitcoin, MNRS represents a new option," Grayscale said in a press release. Grayscale is not the only crypto firm trying this strategy, as Bitwise and CoinShares also have equity funds on the market. — Jesse Pound Information technology is down 4.5% week to date, making it the biggest decliner in the S&P 500 during the period. Nvidia's 16.1% drop during the period has led the sector lower. Fellow chipmaker Super Micro Computer has sold off nearly 15%, followed by Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Juniper Networks down around 13% each. Utilities and industrials have dropped more than 1% for the week, while energy has shed 0.9%. Meanwhile, consumer staples has outperformed the broader market. The sector is up 2.8%, led by J.M. Smucker, Kroger and Costco, which have jumped more than 4% each. — Hakyung Kim Check out some of the companies making headlines in midday trading: Read the full list here. — Brian Evans Small-cap stocks ran circles around their larger counterparts in Thursday's session. The small cap-focused Russell 2000 climbed about 1% in midday trading. By comparison, the S&P 500 traded just slightly above flat. With Thursday's gains, the Russell 2000 sat near flat on week the week, while the S&P 500 was tracking to lose nearly 1%. — Alex Harring The S&P Information Technology Sector was trading 1% lower on Thursday, leading the index's declines for the day. The sector is also the worst performing of the week, down 4% and on pace for its worst weekly performance since September 2024. Tech remains the sole negative sector so far this year. Nvidia, down 16% on the week, leads the sector's declines. Super Micro Computer, Teradyne, ServiceNow and Arista Networks are all down 11% or more on the week. — Nick Wells, Lisa Kailai Han The Department of Justice is suing to block the proposed Hewlett Packard Enterprise acquisition of Juniper Networks on antitrust grounds. The complaint said the merged company, along with rival Cisco Systems, would control "well over 70 percent" of the U.S. market for enterprise wireless network solutions. "This proposed acquisition risks substantially lessening competition in a critically important technology market and thus poses the precise threat that the Clayton Act was enacted to prevent. It should be blocked," the complaint said. Shares of both companies were lower after the complaint was made public. HPE fell 2.5%, while Juniper was down about 3%. — Jesse Pound During Thursday's trading session, 38 stocks in the S&P 500 traded at new 52-week highs. Names that hit this milestone included: On the flip side, nine stocks traded at new 52-week lows. These included UPS, Microchip Technology, Dow and Edison International. — Christopher Hayes, Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Las Vegas Sands were last up 11% on the back of strong Singapore results and renewed optimism due to China's economic recovery. The stock's Thursday gains put it on track for its best day since Sept. 26, 2022, when it rose 11.81%. Las Vegas Sands is currently on pace to notch an 11% weekly rise, which would break its seven-week losing streak — its longest since Aug. 2021. Fellow Macao casino stocks rose in sympathy, with Wynn Resorts, Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts International respectively adding 6%, 2% and 1%. — Adrian van Hauwermeiren, Lisa Kailai Han United Parcel Service shares headed for their worst session on record on Thursday, roiled by an announcement that Amazon was slashing volume. Shares tumbled around 17% in morning trading. If that holds, Thursday would mark the biggest one-day loss ever for UPS, which went public in 1999. Thursday's sell-off came after the delivery giant said it reached a deal with Amazon, its largest customer, to lower volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. UPS also missed the consensus forecast of analysts polled by LSEG for revenue in the fourth quarter, but earnings per share exceeded their expectations. UPS shares are now down more than 12% in 2025, putting the stock on track for its fourth straight losing year. — Alex Harring Shares of Comcast hit their lowest level in more than two years on Thursday after the telecommunications giant's fourth-quarter report showed the company losing broadband subscribers at a faster-than-projected pace. "Net broadband subscriber additions were negative-139,000 in the fourth quarter, which is disappointing and worse than what we indicated in the fourth quarter," Comcast president Michael Cavanagh said on a conference call Thursday. Company executives said they would be putting more emphasis on the mobile wireless business going forward. Shares were last down 9.5% on the session at $33.80. Comcast's stock price has not been that low since 2022. — Jesse Pound Disclosure: NBCUniversal is the parent company of CNBC and NBC News. The AI sell-off on Monday dragged down nuclear stocks as well, but the slide for that group was "unwarranted," according to BCA Research strategist Jeremie Peloso. "AI will continue to support future nuclear energy demand. The long-term bullish case for nuclear energy remains intact. Investors should view the recent pullback as a buying opportunity, especially for uranium mining stocks," Peloso wrote in a note to clients. The Range Nuclear Renaissance ETF (NUKZ) enters Thursday down 10.6% for the week, as does Cameco. Shares of Nuscale Power are down more than 21%. Nuclear and uranium stocks got a boost from the AI trade in 2024, with the idea behind that power-hungry data centers will spur expansions to the U.S. energy grid. — Jesse Pound Stocks opened higher on Thursday after ending Wednesday's trading session lower across the board. The S&P 500 added 0.3%, as did the Nasdaq Composite. The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded fractionally higher. — Lisa Kailai Han Check out the companies making headlines before the bell: The full list can be found here. — Hakyung Kim The U.S. economy grew at a slower-than-expected pace during the final three months of 2024. Gross domestic product grew 2.3% in the fourth quarter on an annualized basis, while economists polled by Dow Jones expected an increase of 2.5%. Full-year GDP expanded at a solid 2.8% pace after growing 2.9% in 2023. — Fred Imbert Hot tub maker Whirlpool tumbled 11% following a fourth-quarter revenue miss. Whirlpool's revenue for the last quarter came out to $4.14 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG had expected $4.24 billion. However, Whirlpool's earnings per share of $4.57 exceeded the estimated $4.32 per share. The company estimated that its full-year adjusted earnings would come out to approximately $10 per share versus the $11.60 estimate. Whirlpool's expected full-year net sales of $15.8 billion was also lower than the expected $16.26 billion. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Coca-Cola are poised to move higher, according to Jefferies. The firm upgraded the beverage and snack giant to buy and raised its price target to $75, suggesting 19% upside from Wednesday's close. "The business is in great shape," analyst Kaumil Gajrawala wrote. "Volumes are compounding, pricing has been earned, and cash flow is about to inflect … meaningfully." The stock is hard to own when the dollar is strengthening, he noted. However, he expects only a 2-cent effect on earnings per share for 2025. Coca-Cola is set to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 11. "Expect Q4 to be a clearing event, bringing in a wave of investors looking for quality at a fair price," Gajrawala said. "Fundamentals support a higher multiple." Shares are up about 1% so far this year. — Michelle Fox Shares of Cigna plummeted 10% Thursday morning after the health insurer reported a fourth-quarter earnings miss. For its last quarter, Cigna posted adjusted earnings of $6.64 per share, which missed the $7.82 analysts were looking for, according to LSEG. However, Cigna's $65.65 billion in revenue exceeded the $63.36 billion estimate. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of Lam Research traded 6% higher Thursday morning after the semiconductor company posted a fiscal second-quarter earnings beat. Lam Research reported adjusted earnings of 91 cents per share, above the 88 cents that analysts were looking for, per LSEG. On the other hand, the company's revenue missed FactSet expectations. Lam Research also provided earnings and revenue guidance for its fiscal third quarter that was higher than what analysts were estimating. Following its earnings report, both Bernstein and Cantor Fitzgerald upgraded the stock to an overweight or outperform rating. — Lisa Kailai Han Shares of UPS were trading more than 13% lower Thursday morning after the shipping company posted a fourth-quarter revenue miss. UPS' $25.30 billion in revenue came in lower than the $25.42 billion analysts polled by LSEG had expected. On the other hand, the company's adjusted earnings of $2.75 per share exceeded the Wall Street consensus of $2.53 per share. — Lisa Kailai Han Engine equipment manufacturing stock Caterpillar slipped 4% in Thursday's premarket trading hours after reporting a fourth-quarter earnings miss. Caterpillar's revenue for the quarter came in at $16.22 billion, while analysts polled by LSEG were expecting $16.39 billion. On the other hand, the company's earnings of $5.14 per share exceeded estimates of $5.02. For its new guidance, Caterpillar said it also expects first-quarter 2025 and full-year 2025 sales and revenue numbers to be lower than their 2024 equivalents. — Lisa Kailai Han IBM shares popped 8% in the premarket after the legacy tech company reported fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations. The company earned $3.92 per share, excluding items, while analysts polled by LSEG anticipated a profit of $3.75 per share. Revenue for IBM came in at $17.55 billion, about in line with expectations. "We closed the year with double-digit revenue growth in Software for the quarter, led by further acceleration in Red Hat. Clients globally continue to turn to IBM to transform with AI. Our generative AI book of business now stands at more than $5B inception-to-date, up nearly $2B quarter over quarter," CEO Arvind Krishna said in a statement. — Fred Imbert UPS fell more than 11% in the premarket after the delivery giant said it reached a deal with Amazon, its largest customer, "to lower its volume by more than 50% by the second half of 2026." UPS also said it is launching "multi-year 'efficiency reimagined' initiatives to drive approximately $1.0 billion in savings." — Fred Imbert Gold futures hit an intraday all-time high above $2,815 per ounce, building on their strong start to 2025. The precious metal is up more than 6% year to date and has climbed 38% over the past 12 months. — Fred Imbert European stock markets opened broadly higher Thursday despite big-name earnings disappointing, with the Stoxx 600 index up 0.4% at 8:26 a.m. in London. Industrials and energy led sector gains, up 0.73% and 0.36%, respectively. Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 were both around 0.3% higher, while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 rose 0.12%. — Jenni Reid Japanese and Australian markets climbed Thursday despite Wall Street losses overnight. Several Asia-Pacific markets were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 and Topix advanced for the second straight day. The Nikkei 225 gained 0.25% to end the day at 39,513.97, while the broader Topix index was up 0.23% to close at 2,781.93. Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Ryozo Himino reportedly said Thursday that the central bank would continue to raise interest rates if the "economy and prices move in line with the bank's forecasts." The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates by 25 basis points to 0.5% in its meeting last week, bringing them to the highest level since 2008. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 extended gains from the previous session to end the day up 0.55% at 8,493.70, its highest since Dec. 5. India's benchmark Nifty 50 was up 0.44%, while the BSE Sensex Index had gained 0.29% as of 1 p.m. local time. — Amala Balakrishner Shares of Tesla rose 4% in extended trading on Wednesday despite its fourth-quarter earnings and revenue missing Wall Street's expectations, and Gene Munster of Deepwater Asset Management believes there could be more gains ahead for the stock. "Ultimately, I think that [Tesla's] numbers are pretty choppy," the managing partner said on CNBC's "Fast Money" following the automaker's results. "It's just hard to … see why it's up right now. I think it's basically confirmation that people think that this has more to go." Tesla reported adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share on $25.71 billion in revenue for the period. That is below the consensus estimate of 76 cents in earnings per share and $27.27 billion in revenue, per LSEG. The stock is on pace to close out the first month of 2025 in negative territory, as it has seen month-to-date losses of more than 3%.

Time Published: 2025-01-29T21:07:00Z
Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."

European shares closed at a record high on Wednesday, boosted by technology stocks following strong results from chip equipment maker ASML, while investors shifted their focus to a monetary policy verdict by the US Federal Reserve. After the Fed decision, due after the close of European markets, attention will to turn to the European Central Bank (ECB), which is expected to cut rates by 25 basis points on Thursday. The Iseq closed 0.2 per cent lower, as Ryanair came under pressure, declining 0.8 per cent to €20.32, despite comments from chief executive Michael O’Leary that he expects Boeing to be given the go-ahead to ramp up production of its 737 jets this year beyond the current regulator-imposed cap of 38 per month. Glanbia lost 1.7 per cent to finish at €14.30, Kerry was down 0.6 per cent at €99.50 and Cairn Homes fell 0.9 per cent to €2.14, while Kingspan edged 0.3 per cent lower to €68.20. Bank of Ireland was one of the key gainers in the session, with its stock rising 1.5 per cent to €9.82. The FTSE 100 inched 0.3 per cent higher, boosted by gains in the technology and financial sectors, while the pound slipped after chancellor of the exchequer Rachel Reeves’s dovish remarks on resetting ties with the EU and the US. The mid-cap FTSE 250 nudged down 0.1 per cent. Financials stocks such as HSBC and Barclays rose 1.4 per cent and 2.4 per cent respectively, while NatWest Group ticked up 2.3 per cent. Automobile shares jumped 3.8 per cent. The majority of that boost came from a 7.5 per cent pop in shares of Dowlais Group after US autoparts maker American Axle and Manufacturing said it will buy it in a cash-and-stock deal. Mexico’s second-largest gold miner Fresnillo was one of the top gainers, with a 2.7 per cent rise after it posted full-year gold production slightly ahead of market outlook. The pan-European Stoxx 600 was up 0.5 per cent, logging its biggest one-day jump in more than one week. The technology sector led gains with a 2.5 per cent rise. ASML surged 5.6 per cent after the Dutch company reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter bookings of €7.09 billion. The chip equipment maker’s earnings also reassured investors that AI chip prospects were still healthy, as they recovered from a selloff sparked by the release of China’s DeepSeek’s model, which uses less computing power than those of rivals. Other semiconductor stocks STMicroelectronics, BE Semiconductor and ASM International gained between 0.8 per cent and 3.1 per cent. Germany’s Dax added 0.9 per cent to close at a record high, boosted by a 4.5 per cent jump in Deutsche Telekom after US peer T-Mobile issued a robust subscriber growth forecast. Swedish truck maker Volvo jumped 7.7 per cent after reporting strong orders for the fourth quarter. Limiting gains, LVMH fell 4.9 per cent as the luxury goods group’s sales growth failed to impress investors following a string of strong results from rivals and recent price gains. Kering and Christian Dior also declined about 5 per cent. The French benchmark CAC 40 index was the only benchmark among major EU economies in the red. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq slipped ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate decision. Nvidia fell 4.6 per cent after rising close to 9 per cent on Tuesday. Its shares were hammered on Monday, after Chinese startup DeepSeek launched AI models. Apple shed 0.6 per cent after brokerage Oppenheimer downgraded its rating to “perform” from “outperform”. The iPhone maker is scheduled to report quarterly earnings later this week. Earnings from “Magnificent Seven” stocks Microsoft, Facebook-parent Meta and Tesla are expected after markets close, as are Intel’s.

The Chinese startup has impressed the tech sector with its robust large language model, built on open-source technology. DeepSeek has also sent shockwaves through the AI industry, showing that it's possible to develop a powerful AI for millions in hardware and training, when American companies like OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft have invested billions. DeepSeek is the brainchild of investor and entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, a Chinese national who studied electronic information and communication engineering at Zhejiang University. Liang began his career in AI by using it for quantitative trading, co-founding the Hangzhou, China-based hedge fund High-Flyer Quantitative Investment Management in 2015. In 2023, Liang launched DeepSeek, focusing on advancing artificial general intelligence. DeepSeek launched its first large language model, DeepSeek-Coder, on November 29, 2023. But it wasn't until January 20, 2025, with the release of DeepSeek-R1, that the company upended the AI industry. With a team of just 200 people and a budget of $6 million, DeepSeek released its free, open-source model, which was on par with OpenAI's much-ballyhooed GPT 01 model—a project that cost as much as $600 million and took an an estimated 3,500 people two years to build. 🚀 DeepSeek-R1 is here! ⚡ Performance on par with OpenAI-o1📖 Fully open-source model & technical report🏆 MIT licensed: Distill & commercialize freely! 🌐 Website & API are live now! Try DeepThink at https://t.co/v1TFy7LHNy today! 🐋 1/n pic.twitter.com/7BlpWAPu6y — DeepSeek (@deepseek_ai) January 20, 2025 Unlike big tech companies with big payrolls in the west, DeepSeek optimized its hiring to focus on recently graduated students: "Three to five years of work experience is the maximum, and those with more than eight years of work experience are basically rejected," a headhunter told 36kr, a popular Chinese tech site. And, whereas OpenAI and other dominant AI models were mainly available as subscription products, DeepSeek’s code is open source, available for public scrutiny and can be downloaded to a local computer via AI playground Huggingface, or as a phone app, for free. DeepSeek’s underlying technology was considered a massive breakthrough in AI and its release sent shockwaves through the US tech sector, wiping out $1 trillion in value in one day. DeepSeek's success comes from its approach to model design and training. Like a massively parallel supercomputer that divides tasks among many processors to work on them simultaneously, DeepSeek’s Mixture-of-Experts system selectively activates only about 37 billion of its 671 billion parameters for each task. This approach significantly improves efficiency, reducing computational costs while still delivering top-tier performance across applications. DeepSeek enhances its training process using Group Relative Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning technique that improves decision-making by comparing a model’s choices against those of similar learning agents. This allows the AI to refine its reasoning more effectively, producing higher-quality training data. DeepSeek has also demonstrated a commitment to open-source accessibility by releasing its models under the MIT license, which allows users to download, deploy, and customize the AI model, distinguishing it from competitors that maintain closed and proprietary systems. Open-source also allows developers to improve upon and share their work with others who can then build on that work in an endless cycle of evolution and improvement. DeepSeek's development is helped by a stockpile of Nvidia A100 chips combined with less expensive hardware. Some estimates put the number of Nvidia chips DeepSeek has access to at around 50,000 GPUs, compared to the 500,000 OpenAI used to train ChatGPT. Many AI technologists have lauded DeepSeek’s powerful, efficient, and low-cost model, while critics have raised concerns about data privacy security. “We are living in a timeline where a non-US company is keeping the original mission of OpenAI alive—truly open, frontier research that empowers all. It makes no sense,” Nvidia Senior Research Manager Dr. Jim Fan wrote on X (formerly Twitter). “The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.” This is the DeepSeek R1 Reasoning Engine running Grok-1 Open Source. The Reasoning Engine allows for new life to be given to older models. It is absolutely fascinating how it works. Look in and see: pic.twitter.com/FErN8TrOF8 — Brian Roemmele (@BrianRoemmele) January 28, 2025 Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that DeepSeek is impressive. “We will obviously deliver much better models and also it's legit invigorating to have a new competitor!” Altman said on X. Days later, though, the firm claimed to have found evidence that DeepSeek used OpenAI's proprietary models to train its own rival model. Critics have also raised questions about DeepSeek's terms of service, cybersecurity practices, and potential ties to the Chinese government. Others have highlighted the extensive amount of user data collected by DeepSeek, including device models, operating systems, keystroke patterns, and IP addresses—data that’s stored on DeepSeek’s China-based servers, according to the firm’s privacy policy. As a general news and also security awareness:Deepseek is a new LLM and it's powerful, but there is a caveat, they collect keystroke patterns, this is not common and can be used to identify yourself in the future in any device or website as keystroke patterns are like individual… pic.twitter.com/8pn1EkzN2K — Raphael de Monticello (@RaphaMonticello) January 23, 2025 “Privacy is an issue because it's China. It’s always about collecting data from users. So user beware,” Kevin Surace, CEO at AI software developer Appvance, told Decrypt. “It will force everyone to rethink how we train models and how much power is required for inference.” DeepSeek’s rapid rise challenges the dominance of Western tech giants and raises significant questions about the future of AI—who builds it, who controls it, and how open and affordable for all it should be. But questions remain about the long-term implications of DeepSeek and whether U.S. President Trump will respond to China's apparent overnight dominance in the AI sector with a TikTok-style ban. Did High-Flyer misrepresent its use of GPUs to make DeepSeek seem more efficient than it actually is? Was DeepSeek’s sudden public launch timed to drive down Nvidia’s stock for the benefit of well-positioned investors? As competitors, including Meta and Perplexity AI, scramble to adapt to DeepSeek’s methodology, the full impact of this AI breakthrough remains uncertain. But one thing is clear: DeepSeek shook up the tech industry by proving yet again that sometimes, resource constraints force innovative breakthroughs and that powerful technology can be built without multi-billion-dollar price tags.

HONG KONG, CHINA - JANUARY 28: Global tech stocks have plummeted following the emergence of ... [+] DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed a competitive AI model at a fraction of the cost of its US rivals, sparking concerns about the high valuations of tech giants like Nvidia. This development has led to significant declines in tech shares across Asia and Europe, with markets in both regions experiencing notable losses as investors reassess the AI landscape and its potential impact on the industry's future. (Photo illustration by Anthony Kwan/Getty Images) A seismic shift in artificial intelligence is underway that promises to reshape not just the tech industry, but the very foundations of major stock indices. At the epicenter of this transformation lies DeepSeek, a Chinese company that has been quietly revolutionizing the artificial intelligence field with its cost-effective, high-performance models. This development is not just a ripple in the tech pond; it’s a tsunami that could wash away established assumptions about AI infrastructure and market valuations. DeepSeek is challenging the status quo in a way that’s sending shockwaves through Silicon Valley and beyond. The company’s flagship model, DeepSeek-R1, isn’t just another entrant in the AI race — it’s a potential game-changer that’s rewriting the rules of engagement. The conventional wisdom in AI has long been that cutting-edge performance comes with a cutting-edge price tag. DeepSeek is turning this notion on its head. According to a comparison by Artificial Analysis, DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated capabilities that not only rival but can even surpass those of industry leaders like OpenAI’s GPT-4. The kicker? It’s achieving these feats at — in some cases — a fraction of the cost. This efficiency breakthrough isn’t just a technical achievement; it’s a potential market disruptor of immense proportions. As Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella cautioned at Davos, “We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously.” Coming from the leader of a company that has poured billions into OpenAI and AI-integrated products like Copilot, these words carry the weight of a market bellwether. The ramifications of DeepSeek’s advancements extend far beyond the tech sector, potentially shaking the very foundations of major market indices. Consider this sobering statistic: Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — the vanguard of the AI revolution — collectively represent about 24% of the S&P 500 and a whopping 32% of the Nasdaq 100. These tech titans have been riding the crest of the AI wave, their valuations soaring to stratospheric heights on the back of AI hype and promise. But what happens when the bedrock of these valuations — the assumed necessity of expensive AI infrastructure — begins to crumble? Nvidia, the chip manufacturer whose GPUs have become synonymous with AI computing, finds itself in a particularly precarious position. In Q2 2024, a staggering 46% of Nvidia’s revenue came from just four companies, likely including tech behemoths Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. This concentration of revenue sources, once seen as a strength, now looks increasingly like a potential Achilles’ heel. The $40,000 Nvidia Blackwell chips, once considered the gold standard and a necessary investment for high-performance AI, may now be viewed through a more critical lens. DeepSeek is proving that top-tier AI performance doesn’t necessarily require top-dollar hardware, a realization that could send shockwaves through Nvidia’s client base and, by extension, its bottom line. This paradigm shift suggests we’re entering a new phase in AI development, one that could redefine winners and losers in the tech space. The focus is moving away from raw computing power and towards efficient model design and practical implementation. In the framework of transformative technology, we’re witnessing a transition from Phase 3 to Phase 4. For investors, this transition necessitates a reevaluation of where value truly lies in the AI ecosystem. The new darlings of Wall Street may well be companies that can effectively implement AI models to solve real-world problems and improve productivity, rather than those simply building bigger and more expensive AI infrastructure. Given the concentration of major indices in AI-centric companies, the market implications of this shift could be profound and far-reaching. We could be on the cusp of a significant near-term market correction as investors scramble to reassess their positions in light of this new paradigm. Despite the potential for short-term turbulence, the long-term outlook for AI remains robust and promising. According to projections from MarketsandMarkets, the global AI market is set to reach a staggering $190.61 billion by 2025, with a compounded annual growth rate of 36.62% from 2024 to 2025. These numbers underscore the enduring potential of AI, even as the industry undergoes a transformative shift. For investors and industry players alike, navigating this new AI landscape will require a recalibration of strategies and expectations. The winners in this new era of AI may not be the companies with the biggest infrastructure investments, but those that can most effectively harness AI’s potential to drive real-world value and productivity gains. As we stand on the brink of this AI revolution, one thing is clear: The tech industry and the market indices that have long been buoyed by its giants are in for a period of significant upheaval. DeepSeek’s breakthrough serves as a stark reminder that in the world of technology, today’s paradigm can quickly become tomorrow’s outdated model. For investors, this presents both challenges and opportunities. The key will be to look beyond the hype and focus on companies that are not just talking about AI, but effectively implementing it in ways that drive tangible value. As the dust settles on this paradigm shift, we may well see a new hierarchy emerge in the tech world — one that values efficiency and practical application over sheer computational might. In this brave new world of AI, the ability to adapt quickly and pivot strategies may prove just as valuable as any technological advantage. As we watch this story unfold, one thing is certain: the AI revolution is far from over. It will take a decade or more for AI to mature and for its potential to be realized, cost reductions through more efficient uses of compute power will be key in adoption and accessibility to AI. DeepSeek has started the essential push toward efficiency, but we are just witnessing the opening chapter of AI’s true transformative potential. Investors should consider how long of a road there is ahead for AI and make sure to size their bets conservatively as there will be many more surprises like DeepSeek ahead.

Title: Everything You Need To Use PlayStation VR2 On PC

Time Published: 2025-01-29T17:00:00Z
Full Content:
The PlayStation VR2 Headset didn’t light the world on fire when it originally released in 2023, but its user base has grown despite a lackluster launch. Plus, the headset itself features some pretty impressive VR hardware. Following a substantial $200 discount in 2024, many PlayStation 5 owners got to enjoy Beatsaber and Resident Evil 4 in first-person for the relatively more affordable price of $349.99. What’s more, Sony has since released a PC Adapter for the VR2, which provides access to the thousands of VR games available on Steam and a new option for VR gamers on PC. What’s not to love? While it’s very cool that PlayStation VR2 works on PC, it does have a few big caveats. Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here, but the TLDR is that you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use. That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor and your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running. The lynchpin of this whole operation is the $59.99 PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter, which Sony released on August 7, 2024. Unfortunately, as of writing, this gadget has been habitually out of stock. Sony’s own website doesn’t have any available for purchase (though I hope they do by the time you read this), and you’ll be lucky to find used adapters at retailers like Best Buy and GameStop. This environment has let third parties pop up with off-brand PlayStation VR2 PC Adapters, which are riskier to use. Amazon reviews indicate that these either work poorly or don’t run at all, so an official Sony Adapter remains ideal despite its scarcity. Make sure you’re purchasing from an official storefront (check for the PlayStation Store mention on Amazon), and look for the PlayStation logo on the adapter itself. In a perfect world, the VR2 Headset and adapter would give you everything you need to get into PC VR gaming. Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, you do need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. The second thing you might need is a supported Bluetooth dongle. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time. Combined with the headset, this means you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on Half-Life Alyx. Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. Next, find and download both the PlayStation VR2 app and Steam VR. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar. In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers. Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection and its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too! The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work. If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into one of those Sony approved dongles. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks. It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. Steam reviews indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far. Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one! .

It’s been another *checks notes* two days, so it’s time for all the latest DeepSeek news. You can also see my previous coverage of the r1 model and, from Monday various reactions including the Panic at the App Store. Before we get to new developments, I especially want to reiterate and emphasize the need to calm down about that $5.5 million ‘cost of training’ for v3. I wouldn’t quite agree with Palmer Lucky that ‘the $5m number is bogus’ and I wouldn’t call it a ‘Chinese psyop’ because I think we mostly did this to ourselves but it is very often being used in a highly bogus way – equating the direct compute cost of training v3 with the all-in cost of creating r1. Which is a very different number. DeepSeek is cracked, they cooked, and r1 is super impressive, but the $5.5 million v3 training cost: Altman handled his response to r1 with grace. OpenAI plans to ‘pull up some new releases.’ Meaning, oh, you want to race? I suppose I’ll go faster and take less precautions. Sam Altman: deepseek’s r1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they’re able to deliver for the price. we will obviously deliver much better models and also it’s legit invigorating to have a new competitor! we will pull up some releases. but mostly we are excited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission. the world is going to want to use a LOT of ai, and really be quite amazed by the next gen models coming. look forward to bringing you all AGI and beyond. It is very Galaxy Brain to say ‘this is perhaps good for OpenAI’ and presumably it very much is, but here’s a scenario. Ethan Mollick: DeepSeek is a really good model, but it is not generally a better model than o1 or Claude. But since it is both free & getting a ton of attention, I think a lot of people who were using free “mini” models are being exposed to what a early 2025 reasoner AI can do & are surprised I’m not saying that’s the baseline scenario, but I do expect the world to be quite amazed at the next generation of models, and they could now be more primed for that. Mark Chen (Chief Research Officer, OpenAI): Congrats to DeepSeek on producing an o1-level reasoning model! Their research paper demonstrates that they’ve independently found some of the core ideas that we did on our way to o1. However, I think the external response has been somewhat overblown, especially in narratives around cost. One implication of having two paradigms (pre-training and reasoning) is that we can optimize for a capability over two axes instead of one, which leads to lower costs. But it also means we have two axes along which we can scale, and we intend to push compute aggressively into both! As research in distillation matures, we’re also seeing that pushing on cost and pushing on capabilities are increasingly decoupled. The ability to serve at lower cost (especially at higher latency) doesn’t imply the ability to produce better capabilities. We will continue to improve our ability to serve models at lower cost, but we remain optimistic in our research roadmap, and will remain focused in executing on it. We’re excited to ship better models to you this quarter and over the year! Given the costs involved, and that you can scale to get better outputs, ‘serve faster and cheaper’ and ‘get better answers’ seem pretty linked, or are going to look rather similar. There is still a real and important difference between ‘I spend 10x as much compute to get 10x as many tokens to think with’ versus ‘I taught the model how to do longer CoT’ versus ‘I made the model smarter.’ Or at least I think there is. Should we now abandon all our plans to build gigantic data centers because DeepSeek showed we can run AI cheaper? No. Of course not. We’ll need more. Jevons Paradox and all that. Another question is compute governance. Does DeepSeek’s model prove that there’s no point in using compute thresholds for frontier model governance? My answer is no. DeepSeek did not mean the scaling laws stopped working. DeepSeek found new ways to scale and economize, and also to distill. But doing the same thing with more compute would have gotten better results, and indeed more compute is getting other labs better results if you don’t control for compute costs, and also they will now get to use these innovations themselves. Karen Hao: Much of the coverage has focused on U.S.-China tech competition. That misses a bigger story: DeepSeek has demonstrated that scaling up AI models relentlessly, a paradigm OpenAI introduced and champions, is not the only, and far from the best, way to develop AI. Yoavgo: This is trending in my feed, but I don’t get it. DeepSeek did not show that scale is not the way to go for AI (their base model is among the largest in parameter counts; their training data is huge, at 13 trillion tokens). They just scaled more efficiently. Thus far OpenAI & its peer scaling labs have sought to convince the public & policymakers that scaling is the best way to reach so-called AGI. This has always been more of an argument based in business than in science. Jon Stokes: Holy wow what do words even mean. What R1 does is a new type of scaling. It’s also GPU-intensive. In fact, the big mystery today in AI world is why NVIDIA dropped despite R1 demonstrating that GPUs are even more valuable than we thought they were. No part of this is coherent. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): The real takeaway from DeepSeek is that with reasoning models you can achieve great performance with a small amount of compute. Now imagine what you can do with a large amount of compute. Noam Brown (OpenAI): Algorithmic breakthroughs and scaling are complementary, not in competition. The former bends the performance vs compute curve, while the latter moves further along the curve. Benjamin Todd: Deepseek hasn’t shown scaling doesn’t work. Take Deepseek’s techniques, apply 10x the compute, and you’ll get much better performance. And compute efficiency has always been part of the scaling paradigm. Ethan Mollick: The most unnerving part of the DeepSeek reaction online has been seeing folks take it as a sign that AI capability growth is not real. It signals the opposite, large improvements are possible, and is almost certain to kick off an acceleration in AI development through competition. I know a lot of people want AI to go away, but I am seeing so many interpretations of DeepSeek in ways that don’t really make sense, or misrepresent what they did. Dealing with the implications of AI, and trying to steer it towards positive use, is now more urgent, not less. Andrew Rettek: Deepseek means OPENAI just increased their effective compute by more than an OOM. OpenAI and Anthropic (in the forms of CEOs Sam Altman and Dario Amodei) have both expressed agreement on that since the release of r1, saying that they still believe the future involves very large and expensive training runs, including large amounts of compute on the RL step. David Sacks agreed as well, so the administration knows. One can think of all this as combining multiple distinct scaling laws. Mark Chen above talked about two axes but one could refer to at least four? Also you can extend to new modalities and use cases and so on. So essentially: Buckle up. Speaking of buckling up, nothing to see here, just a claimed 2x speed boost to r1, written by r1. Of course, that’s very different from r1 coming up with the idea. Aiden McLaughlin: switching to reasoners is like taking a sharp turn on a racetrack. everyone brakes to take the turn; for a moment, all cars look neck-and-neck when exiting the turn, small first-mover advantages compound. and ofc, some cars have enormous engines that eat up straight roads Dean Ball: I recommend trying not to overindex on the industry dynamics you’re observing now in light of the deepseek plot twist, or indeed of any particular plot twist. It’s a long game, and we’re riding a world-historical exponential. Things will change a lot, fast, again and again. It’s not that Jan is wrong, I’d be a lot more interested in paying for o1 pro if I had pdfs enabled, but… yeah. China Talk covers developments. The headline conclusion is that yes, compute very much will continue to be a key factor, everyone agrees on this. They note there is a potential budding DeepSeek partnership with ByteDance, which could unlock quite a lot of compute. Here was some shade: Founder and CEO Liang Wenfeng is the core person of DeepSeek. He is not the same type of person as Sam Altman. He is very knowledgeable about technology. Also important at least directionally: Pioneers vs. Chasers: ‘AI Progress Resembles a Step Function – Chasers Require 1/10th the Compute’ Fundamentally, DeepSeek was far more of an innovator than other Chinese AI companies, but it was still a chaser here, not a pioneer, except in compute efficiency, which is what chasers do best. If you want to maintain a lead and it’s much easier to follow than lead, well, time to get good and scale even more. Or you can realize you’re just feeding capability to the Chinese and break down crying and maybe keep your models for internal use, it’s an option. I found this odd: It’s odd because DeepSeek spent so little compute, and the efficiency gains pay for themselves in compute quite rapidly. And also the big companies are indeed releasing rapidly. Google and OpenAI are constantly shipping, even Anthropic ships. The idea of company focus seems more on point, and yes DeepSeek traded multimodality and other features for pure efficiency because they had to. Also note what they say later: As in, r1 is technically impressive as hell, and it definitely has its uses, but there’s a reason the existing models look like they do – the corners DeepSeek cut actually do matter for what people want. Of course DeepSeek will likely now turn to fixing such problems among other things and we’ll see how efficiently they can do that too. McKay Wrigley emphasizes the point that visible chain of thought (CoT) is a prompt debugger. It’s hard to go back to not seeing CoT after seeing CoT. Gallabytes reports that DeepSeek’s image model Janus Pro is a good first effort, but not good yet. Even if we were to ‘fully unlock’ all computing power in personal PCs for running AI, that would only increase available compute by ~10%, most compute is in data centers. We had a brief period where DeepSeek would serve you up r1 free and super fast. It turns out that’s not fully sustainable or at least needs time to scale as fast as demand rose, and you know how such folks feel about the ‘raise prices’ meme, Gallabytes: got used to r1 and now that it’s overloaded it’s hard to go back. @deepseek_ai please do something amazing and be the first LLM provider to offer surge pricing. the unofficial APIs are unusably slow. I too encountered slowness, and instantly it made me realize ‘yes the speed was a key part of why I loved this.’ DeItaone (January 27, 11:09am): DEEPSEEK SAYS SERVICE DEGRADED DUE TO ‘LARGE-SCALE MALICIOUS ATTACK’ Could be that. Could be too much demand and not enough supply. This will of course sort itself out in time, as long as you’re willing to pay, and it’s an open model so others can serve the model as well, but ‘everyone wants to use the shiny new model you are offering for free’ is going to run into obvious problems. Yes, of course one consideration is that if you use DeepSeek’s app it will collect all your data including device model, operating system, keystroke patterns or rhythms, IP address and so on and store it all in China. Did you for a second think otherwise? What you do with that info is on you. This doesn’t appear to rise to TikTok 2.0 levels of rendering your phone and data insecure, but let us say that ‘out of an abundance of caution’ I will be accessing the model through their website not the app thank you very much. Liv Boeree: tiktok round two, here we go. AI enthusiasts have the self control of an incontinent chihuahua. Typing Loudly: you can run it locally without an internet connection Liv Boeree: cool and what percentage of these incontinent chihuahuas will actually do this. I’m not going so far as to use third party providers for now, because I’m not feeding any sensitive data into the model, and DeepSeek’s implementation here is very nice and clean, so I’ve decided lazy is acceptable. I’m certainly not laying out ~$6,000 for a self-hosting rig, unless someone wants to buy one for me in the name of science. Note that if you’re looking for an alternative source, you want to ensure you’re not getting one of the smaller distillations, unless that is what you want. Janus is testing for steganography in r1, potentially looking for assistance. Janus also thinks Thebes theory here is likely to be true, that v3 was hurt by dividing into too many too small experts, but r1 lets them all dump their info into the CoT and collaborate, at least partially fixing this. Janus notes that r1 simply knows things and thinks about them, straight up, in response to Thebes speculating that all our chain of thought considerations have now put sufficient priming into the training data that CoT approaches work much better than they used to, which Prithviraj says is not the case, he says it’s about improved base models, which is the first obvious thought – the techniques work better off a stronger base, simple as that. Thebes: why did R1’s RL suddenly start working, when previous attempts to do similar things failed? theory: we’ve basically spent the last few years running a massive acausally distributed chain of thought data annotation program on the pretraining dataset. deepseek’s approach with R1 is a pretty obvious method. They are far from the first lab to try “slap a verifier on it and roll out CoTs.” But it didn’t used to work that well. … In the last couple of years, chains of thought have been posted all over the internet … Those CoTs in the V3 training set gave GRPO enough of a starting point to start converging, and furthermore, to generalize from verifiable domains to the non-verifiable ones using the bridge established by the pretraining data contamination. And now, R1’s visible chains of thought are going to lead to *another* massive enrichment of human-labeled reasoning on the internet, but on a far larger scale… The next round of base models post-R1 will be *even better* bases for reasoning models. in some possible worlds, this could also explain why OpenAI seemingly struggled so much with making their reasoning models in comparison. if they’re still using 4base or distils of it. Prithvraj: Simply, no. I’ve been looking at my old results from doing RL with “verifiable” rewards (math puzzle games, python code to pass unit tests) starting from 2019 with GPT-1/2 to 2024 with Qwen Math Deepseek’s success likely lies in the base models improving, the RL is constant Janus: This is an interesting hypothesis. DeepSeek R1 also just seems to have a much more lucid and high-resolution understanding of LLM ontology and history than any other model I’ve seen. (DeepSeek V3 did not seem to in my limited interactions with it, though.) I did not expect this on priors for a reasoner, but perhaps the main way that r1 seems smarter than any other LLM I’ve played with is the sheer lucidity and resolution of its world model—in particular, its knowledge of LLMs, both object- and meta-level, though this is also the main domain of knowledge I’ve engaged it in, and perhaps the only one I can evaluate at world-expert level. So, it may apply more generally. In effective fluid intelligence and attunement to real-time context, it actually feels weaker than, say, Claude 3.5 Sonnet. But when I talk to Sonnet about my ideas on LLMs, it feels like it is more naive than me, and it is figuring out a lot of things in context from “first principles.” When I talk to Opus about these things, it feels like it is understanding me by projecting the concepts onto more generic, resonant hyperobjects in its prior, meaning it is easy to get on the same page philosophically, but this tropological entanglement is not very precise. But with r1, it seems like it can simply reference the same concrete knowledge and ontology I have, much more like a peer. And it has intense opinions about these things. Wordgrammer thread on the DeepSeek technical breakthroughs. Here’s his conclusion, which seems rather overdetermined: Wordgrammer: “Is the US losing the war in AI??” I don’t think so. DeepSeek had a few big breakthroughs, we have had hundreds of small breakthroughs. If we adopt DeepSeek’s architecture, our models will be better. Because we have more compute and more data. r1 tells us it only takes ~800k samples of ‘good’ RL reasoning to convert other models into RL reasoners, and Alex Dimakis says it could be a lot less, in his test they outperformed o1-preview with only 17k. Now that r1 is out, everyone permanently has an unlimited source of at least pretty good samples. From now on, to create or release a model is to create or release the RL version of that model, even more than before. That’s on top of all the other modifications you automatically release. Oliver Blanchard: DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive tfp shock in the history of the world. The nerdy version, to react to some of the comments. (Yes, electricity was big): DeepSeek and what happened yesterday: Probably the largest positive one day change in the present discounted value of total factor productivity growth in the history of the world. James Steuart: I can’t agree Professor, Robert Gordon’s book gives many such greater examples. Electric lighting is a substantially greater TFP boost than marginally better efficiency in IT and professional services! There were some bigger inventions in the past, but on much smaller baselines. Our reaction to this was to sell the stocks of those who provide the inputs that enable that tfp shock. There were other impacts as well, including to existential risk, but as we’ve established the market isn’t ready for that conversation in the sense that the market (highly reasonably as has been previously explained) will be ignoring it entirely. Daniel Eth: Hot take, but if the narrative from NYT et al had not been “lol you don’t need that many chips to train AI systems” but instead “Apparently AI is *not* hitting a wall”, then the AI chip stocks would have risen instead of fallen. Billy Humblebrag: “Deepseek shows that ai can be built more cheaply than we thought so you don’t need to worry about ai” is a hell of a take Joe Weisenthal: Morgan Stanley: “We gathered feedback from a number of industry sources and the consistent takeaway is that this is not affecting plans for GPU buildouts.” I would not discount the role of narrative and vibes in all this. I don’t think that’s the whole Nvidia drop or anything. But it matters. Roon: Plausible reasons for Nvidia drop: We will want more compute now until the heat death of the universe; it’s the only reason that doesn’t make sense. Palmer Lucky: The markets are not smarter on AI. The free hand is not yet efficient because the number of legitimate experts in the field is near-zero. The average person making AI calls on Wall Street had no idea what AI even was a year ago and feels compelled to justify big moves. Alex Cheema notes that Apple was up on Monday, and that Apple’s chips are great for running v3 and r1 inference. Alex Cheema: Market close: $NVDA: -16.91% | $AAPL: +3.21% Why is DeepSeek great for Apple? Here’s a breakdown of the chips that can run DeepSeek V3 and R1 on the market now: NVIDIA H100: 80GB @ 3TB/s, $25,000, $312.50 per GB AMD MI300X: 192GB @ 5.3TB/s, $20,000, $104.17 per GB Apple M2 Ultra: 192GB @ 800GB/s, $5,000, $26.04(!!) per GB Apple’s M2 Ultra (released in June 2023) is 4x more cost efficient per unit of memory than AMD MI300X and 12x more cost efficient than NVIDIA H100! Eric Hartford: 3090s, $700 for 24gb = $29/gb. Alex Cheema: You need a lot of hardware around them to load a 700GB model in 30 RTX 3090s. I’d love to see it though, closest to this is probably stacking @__tinygrad__ boxes. That’s cute. But I do not think that was the main reason why Apple was up. I think Apple was up because their strategy doesn’t depend on having frontier models but it does depend on running AIs on iPhones. Apple can now get their own distillations of r1, and use them for Apple Intelligence. A highly reasonable argument. The One True Newsletter, Matt Levine’s Money Stuff, is of course on the case of DeepSeek’s r1 crashing the stock market, and asking what cheap inference for everyone would do to market prices. He rapidly shifts focus to non-AI companies, asking which ones benefit. It’s great if you use AI to make your management company awesome, but not if you get cut out because AI replaces your management company. (And you. And the people it manages. And all of us. And maybe we all die.) But I digress. (To digress even further: While I’m reading that column, I don’t understand why we should care about the argument under ‘Dark Trading,’ since this mechanism decreases retail transaction costs to trade and doesn’t impact long term price discovery at all, and several LLMs confirmed this once challenged.) Ben Thompson continues to give his completely different kind of technical tech company perspective, in FAQ format, including good technical explanations that agree with what I’ve said in previous columns. Here’s a fascinating line: Q: I asked why the stock prices are down; you just painted a positive picture! A: My picture is of the long run; today is the short run, and it seems likely the market is working through the shock of R1’s existence. That sounds like Ben Thompson is calling it a wrong-way move, and indeed later he explicitly endorses Jevons Paradox and expects compute use to rise. The market is supposed to factor in the long run now. There is no ‘this makes the price go down today and then up next week’ unless you’re very much in the ‘the EMH is false’ camp. And these are literally the most valuable companies in the world. Here’s another key one: Q: So are we close to AGI? A: It definitely seems like it. This also explains why Softbank (and whatever investors Masayoshi Son brings together) would provide the funding for OpenAI that Microsoft will not: the belief that we are reaching a takeoff point where there will in fact be real returns towards being first. Masayoshi Sun feels the AGI. Masayoshi Sun feels everything. He’s king of feeling it. His typical open-model-stanning arguments on existential risk later in the past are as always disappointing, but in no way new or unexpected. It continues to astound me that such intelligent people can think: Well, there’s no stopping us creating things more capable and intelligent than humans, so the best way to ensure that things smarter than more capable than humans go well for humans is to ensure that there are as many such entities as possible and that humans cannot possibly have any collective control over those new entities. On another level, of course, I’ve accepted that people do think this. That they somehow cannot fathom that if you create things more intelligent and capable and competitive than humans there could be the threat that all the humans would end up with no power, rather than that the wrong humans might have too much power. Or think that this would be a good thing – because the wrong humans wouldn’t have power. Similarly, Ben’s call for absolutely no regulations whatsoever, no efforts at safety whatsoever outside of direct profit motives, ‘cut out all the cruft in our companies that has nothing to do with winning,’ is exactly the kind of rhetoric I worry about getting us all killed in response to these developments. I should still reiterate that Ben to his credit is very responsible and accurate here in his technical presentation, laying out what DeepSeek and r1 are and aren’t accomplishing here rather than crying missile gap. But the closing message remains the same. The term Trump uses is ‘tariffs.’ I propose, at least in the context of GPUs, that we call these ‘import restrictions,’ in order to point out that we are (I believe wisely!) imposing ‘export restrictions’ as a matter of national security to ensure we get all the chips, and using diffusion regulations to force the chips to be hosted at home, then we are threatening to impose ‘up to 100%’ tariffs on those same chips, because ‘they left us’ and they want ‘to force them to come back,’ and they’ll build the new factories here instead of there, with their own money, because of the threat. Except for the fact that we really, really want the data centers at home. The diffusion regulations are largely to force companies to create them at home. Arthur B: Regarding possible US tariffs on Taiwan chips. First, this is one that US consumers would directly feel, it’s less politically feasible than tariffs on imports with lots of substitutes. Second, data centers don’t have to be located in the US. Canada is next door and has plenty of power. Dhiraj: Taiwan made the largest single greenfield FDI in US history through TSMC. Now, instead of receiving gratitude for helping the struggling US chip industry, Taiwan faces potential tariffs. In his zero-sum worldview, there are no friends. The whole thing is insane! Completely nuts. If he’s serious. And yes he said this on Joe Rogan previously, but he said a lot of things previously that he didn’t mean. Whereas Trump’s worldview is largely the madman theory, at least for trade. If you threaten people with insane moves that would hurt both of you, and show that you’re willing to actually enact insane moves, then they are forced to give you what you want. In this case, what Trump wants is presumably for TSMC to announce they are building more new chip factories in America. I agree that this would be excellent, assuming they were actually built. We have an existence proof that it can be done, and it would greatly improve our strategic position and reduce geopolitical risk. I presume Trump is mostly bluffing, in that he has no intention of actually imposing these completely insane tariffs, and he will ultimately take a minor win and declare victory. But what makes it nerve wracking is that, by design, you never know. If you did know none of this would ever work. Unless, some people wondered, there was another explanation for all this… Nabeel Qureshi (Tuesday, 2pm): Crazy that people in this corner of X have a faster OODA loop than the stock market This was the largest single day drop in a single stock in world history. It wiped out over $500 billion in market value. One had to wonder if it was partially insider trading. Timothy Lee: Everyone says DeepSeek caused Nvidia’s stock to crash yesterday. I think this theory makes no sense. DeepSeek’s success isn’t bad news for Nvidia. I don’t think that this was insider trading. The tariff threat was already partly known and thus priced in. It’s a threat rather than an action, which means it’s likely a bluff. That’s not a 17% move. Then we have the bounceback on Tuesday. Even if I was certain that this was mostly an insider trading move instead of being rather confident it mostly or entirely wasn’t, I wouldn’t go as far as Eliezer does in the the below quote. The SEC does many important things. But I do notice that there’s a non-zero amount of ‘wait a minute’ that will occur to me the next time I’m hovering around the buy button in haste. Eliezer Yudkowsky: I heard from many people who said, “An NVDA drop makes no sense as a Deepseek reaction; buying NVDA.” So those people have now been cheated by insider counterparties with political access. They may make fewer US trades in the future. Also note that the obvious meaning of this news is that someone told and convinced Trump that China will invade Taiwan before the end of his term, and the US needs to wean itself off Taiwanese dependence. This was a $400B market movement, and if @SECGov can’t figure out who did it then the SEC has no reason to exist. TBC, I’m not saying that figuring it out would be easy or bringing the criminals to justice would be easy. I’m saying that if the US markets are going to be like this anyway on $400B market movements, why bother paying the overhead cost of having an SEC that doesn’t work? Roon: [Trump’s tariff threats about Taiwan] didn’t move overnight markets at all which either means markets either: – don’t believe it’s credible – were pricing this in yesterday while internet was blaming the crash out on deepseek I certainly don’t agree that the only interpretation of this news is ‘Trump expects an invasion of Taiwan.’ Trump is perfectly capable of doing this for exactly the reasons he’s saying. Trump is also fully capable of making this threat with no intention of following through, in order to extract concessions from Taiwan or TSMC, perhaps of symbolic size. Trump is also fully capable of doing this so that he could inform his hedge fund friends in advance and they could make quite a lot of money – with or without any attempt to actually impose the tariffs ever, since his friends would have now covered their shorts in this scenario. Indeed do many things come to pass. I don’t know anything you don’t know. It would be a good sign if DeepSeek had a plan for safety, even if it wasn’t that strong? Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): DeepSeek should create a preparedness framework/RSP if they continue to scale reasoning models. Very happy to [help them with this]! We don’t quite have nothing. This below is the first actively positive sign for DeepSeek on safety, however small. Stephen McAleer (OpenAI): Does DeepSeek have any safety researchers? What are Liang Wenfeng’s views on AI safety? Sarah (YuanYuanSunSara): [DeepSeek] signed Artificial Intelligence safety commitment by CAICT (gov backed institute). You can see the whale sign at the bottom if you can’t read their name Chinese. This involves AI safety governance structure, safety testing, do frontier AGI safety research (include loss of control) and share it publicly. None legally binding but it’s a good sign. Here is a chart with the Seoul Commitments versus China’s version. It is of course much better that DeepSeek signed onto a symbolic document like this. That’s a good sign, whereas refusing would have been a very bad sign. But as always, talk is cheap, this doesn’t concretely commit DeepSeek to much, and even fully abiding by commitments like this won’t remotely be enough. I do think this is a very good sign that agreements and coordination are possible. But if we want that, we will have to Pick Up the Phone. Here’s a weird different answer. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI, Head of Mission Alignment): I think a better question is whether or not science fiction culture in China has a fixation on the kinds of topics that would help them think about it. If Three-Body Problem is any indication, things will be OK. It’s a question worth asking, but I don’t think this is a better question? And based on the book, I do not think Three-Body Problem (conceptual spoilers follow, potentially severe ones depending on your perspective) is great here. Consider the decision theory that those books endorse, and what happens to us and also the universe as a result. It’s presenting all of that as essentially inevitable, and trying to think otherwise as foolishness. It’s endorsing that what matters is paranoia, power and a willingness to use it without mercy in an endless war of all against all. Also consider how they paint the history of the universe entirely without AGI. I want to be clear that I fully agree with Bill Gurley that ‘no one at DeepSeek is an enemy of mine,’ indeed There Is No Enemy Anywhere, with at most notably rare exceptions that I invite to stop being exceptions. However, I do think that if they continue down their current path, they are liable to get us all killed. And I for one am going to take the bold stance that I think that this is bad, and they should therefore alter their path before reaching their stated destination. How committed is DeepSeek to its current path? Read this quote Ben Thompson links to very carefully: Q: DeepSeek, right now, has a kind of idealistic aura reminiscent of the early days of OpenAI, and it’s open source. Will you change to closed source later on? Both OpenAI and Mistral moved from open-source to closed-source. Answer from DeepSeek CEO Liang Wenfeng: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem first is more important. This is from November. And that’s not a no. That’s actually a maybe. Note what he didn’t say: A Different Answer: We will not change to closed source. We believe having a strong technical ecosystem is more important. The difference? His answer includes the word ‘first.’ He’s saying that first you need a strong technical ecosystem, and he believes that open models are the key to attracting talent and developing a strong technical ecosystem. Then, once that exists, you would need to protect your advantage. And yes, that is exactly what happened with… OpenAI. I wanted to be sure that this translation was correct, so I turned to Wenfang’s own r1, and asked the interviewer for the original statement, which was: 梁文锋：我们不会闭源。我们认为先有一个强大的技术生态更重要。 r1’s translation: “We will not close our source code. We believe that establishing a strong technological ecosystem must come first.” To quote r1: Based solely on this statement, Liang is asserting that openness is non-negotiable because it is essential to the ecosystem’s strength. While no one can predict the future, the phrasing suggests a long-term commitment to open-source as a core value, not a temporary tactic. To fully guarantee permanence, you’d need additional evidence (e.g., licensing choices, governance models, past behavior). But as it stands, the statement leans toward “permanent” in spirit. I interpret this as a statement of a pragmatic motivation – if that motivation changes, or a more important one is created, actions would change. For now, yes, openness. The Washington Post had a profile of DeepSeek and Liang Wenfeng. One note is that the hedge fund that they’re a spinoff from has donated over $80 million to charity since 2020, which makes it more plausible DeepSeek has no business model, or at least no medium-term business model. But that government embrace is new for DeepSeek, said Matt Sheehan, an expert on China’s AI industry at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “They were not the ‘chosen one’ of Chinese AI start-ups,” said Sheehan, noting that many other Chinese start-ups received more government funding and contracts. “DeepSeek took the world by surprise, and I think to a large extent, they took the Chinese government by surprise.” Sheehan added that for DeepSeek, more government attention will be a “double-edged sword.” While the company will probably have more access to government resources, “there’s going to be a lot of political scrutiny on them, and that has a cost of its own,” he said. Yes. This reinforces the theory that DeepSeek’s ascent took China’s government by surprise, and they had no idea what v3 and r1 were as they were released. Going forward, China is going to be far more aware. In some ways, DeepSeek will have lots of support. But there will be strings attached. That starts with the ordinary censorship demands of the CCP. If you self-host r1, and you ask it about any of the topics the CCP dislikes, r1 will give you a good, well-balanced answer. If you ask on DeepSeek’s website, it will censor you via some sort of cloud-based monitoring, which works if you’re closed source, but DeepSeek is trying to be fully open source. Something has to give, somewhere. Also, even if you’re using the official website, it’s not like you can’t get around it. Justine Moore: DeepSeek’s censorship is no match for the jailbreakers of Reddit I mean, that was easy. Joshua Achiam (OpenAI Head of Mission Alignment): This has deeply fascinating consequences for China in 10 years – when the CCP has to choose between allowing their AI industry to move forward, or maintaining censorship and tight ideological control, which will they choose? And if they choose their AI industry, especially if they favor open source as a strategy for worldwide influence: what does it mean for their national culture and government structure in the long run, when everyone who is curious can find ways to have subversive conversations? Ten years to figure this out? If they’re lucky, they’ve got two. My guess is they don’t. I worry about the failure to feel the AGI or even the AI here from Joshua Achiam, given his position at OpenAI. Ten years is a long time. Sam Altman expects AGI well before that. This goes well beyond Altman’s absurd position of ‘AGI will be invented and your life won’t noticeably change for a long time.’ Choices are going to need to be made. Even if AI doesn’t advance much from here, choices will have to be made. As I’ve noted before, censorship at the model layer is expensive. It’s harder to do, and when you do it you risk introducing falsity into a mind in ways that will have widespread repercussions. Even then, a fine tune can easily remove any gaps in knowledge, or any reluctance to discuss particular topics, whether they are actually dangerous things like building bombs or things that piss off the CCP like a certain bear that loves honey. I got called out on Twitter for supposed cognitive dissonance on this – look at China’s actions, they clearly let this happen. Again, my claim is that China didn’t realize what this was until after it happened, they can’t undo it (that’s the whole point!) and they are of course going to embrace their national champion. That has little to do with what paths DeepSeek is allowed to follow going forward. (Also, since it was mentioned in that response, I should note – there is a habit of people conflating ‘pause’ with ‘ever do anything to regulate AI at all.’ I do not believe I said anything about a pause – I was talking about whether China would let DeepSeek continue to release open weights as capabilities improve.) Before I further cover potential policy responses, a question we must ask this week is: I very much do not wish to do this at this time, but suppose in the future we did want to restrict use of a particular already open weights model and its derivatives, or all models in some reference class. What would our options be? Obviously we couldn’t fully ban it in terms of preventing determined people from having access. And if you try to stop them and others don’t, there are obvious problems with that, including ‘people have internet connections.’ However, that does not mean that we would have actual zero options. Steve Sailer: Does open source, low cost DeepSeek mean that there is no way, short of full-blown Butlerian Jihad against computers, which we won’t do, to keep AI bottled up, so we’re going to find out if Yudkowsky’s warnings that AI will go SkyNet and turn us into paperclips are right? Gabriel: It’s a psy-op If hosting a 70B is illegal: – Almost all individuals stop – All companies stop – All research labs stop – All compute providers stop Already huge if limited to US+EU Can argue about whether good/bad, but not about the effect size. You can absolutely argue about effect size. What you can’t argue is that the effect size isn’t large. It would make a big difference for many practical purposes. In terms of my ‘Levels of Friction’ framework (post forthcoming) this is moving the models from Level 1 (easy to access) to at least Level 3 (annoying with potential consequences.) That has big practical consequences, and many important use cases will indeed go away or change dramatically. What Level 3 absolutely won’t do, here or elsewhere, is save you from determined people who want it badly enough, or from sufficiently capable models that do not especially care what you tell them not to do or where you tell them not to be. Or scenarios where the law is no longer especially relevant, and the government or humanity is very much having a ‘do you feel in charge?’ moment. And that alone would, in many scenarios, be enough to doom you to varying degrees. If that’s what dooms you and the model is already open, well, you’re pretty doomed. And also it won’t save you from various scenarios where what the law thinks is not especially relevant. If for whatever reason the government or humanity decides (or realizes) that this is insufficient, then there are two possibilities. Either the government or humanity is disempowered and you hope that this works out for humanity in some way. Or we use the necessary means to push the restrictions up to Level 4 (akin to rape and murder) or Level 5 (akin to what we do to stop terrorism or worse), in ways I assure you that you are very much not going to like – but the alternative might be worse, and the decision might very much not be up to either of us. Actions have consequences. Plan for them. Adam Ozimek was first I saw point out this time around with DeepSeek (I and many others echo this a lot in general) that the best way for the Federal Government to ensure American dominance of AI is to encourage more high skilled immigration and brain drain the world. If you don’t want China to have DeepSeek, export controls are great and all but how about let’s straight up steal their engineers. But y’all, and by y’all I mean Donald Trump, aren’t ready for that conversation. It is highly unfortunate that David Sacks, the person seemingly in charge of what AI executive orders Trump signs, is so deeply confused about what various provisions actually did or would do, and on our regulatory situation relative to that of China. David Sacks: DeepSeek R1 shows that the AI race will be very competitive and that President Trump was right to rescind the Biden EO, which hamstrung American AI companies without asking whether China would do the same. (Obviously not.) I’m confident in the U.S. but we can’t be complacent. Donald Trump: The release of DeepSeek AI from a Chinese company should be a wake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing to win. … We’re going to dominate. We’ll dominate everything. This is the biggest danger of all – that we go full Missile Gap jingoism and full-on race to ‘beat China,’ and act like we can’t afford to do anything to ensure the safety of the AGIs and ASIs we plan on building, even pressuring labs not to make such efforts in private, or threatening them with antitrust or other interventions for trying. The full Trump clip is hilarious, including him saying they may have come up with a cheaper method but ‘no one knows if it is true.’ His main thrust is, oh, you made doing AI cheaper and gave it all away to us for free, thanks, that’s great! I love paying less money for things! And he’s presumably spinning, but he’s also not wrong about that. I also take some small comfort in him framing revoking the Biden EO purely in terms of wokeness. If that’s all he thinks was bad about it, that’s a great sign. Harlan Stewart: “Deepseek R1 is AI’s Sputnik moment” Sure. I guess it’s like if the Soviets had told the world how to make their own Sputniks and also offered everyone a lifetime supply of free Sputniks. And the US had already previously figured out how to make an even bigger Sputnik. Yishan: I think the Deepseek moment is not really the Sputnik moment, but more like the Google moment. If anyone was around in ~2004, you’ll know what I mean, but more on that later. I think everyone is over-rotated on this because Deepseek came out of China. Let me try to un-rotate you. Deepseek could have come out of some lab in the US Midwest. Like say some CS lab couldn’t afford the latest nVidia chips and had to use older hardware, but they had a great algo and systems department, and they found a bunch of optimizations and trained a model for a few million dollars and lo, the model is roughly on par with o1. Look everyone, we found a new training method and we optimized a bunch of algorithms! Everyone is like OH WOW and starts trying the same thing. Great week for AI advancement! No need for US markets to lose a trillion in market cap. The tech world (and apparently Wall Street) is massively over-rotated on this because it came out of CHINA. … Deepseek is MUCH more like the Google moment, because Google essentially described what it did and told everyone else how they could do it too. … There is no reason to think nVidia and OAI and Meta and Microsoft and Google et al are dead. Sure, Deepseek is a new and formidable upstart, but doesn’t that happen every week in the world of AI? I am sure that Sam and Zuck, backed by the power of Satya, can figure something out. Everyone is going to duplicate this feat in a few months and everything just got cheaper. The only real consequence is that AI utopia/doom is now closer than ever. I believe that alignment, and getting a good outcome for humans, was already going to be very hard. It’s going to be a lot harder if we actively try to get ourselves killed like this, and turn even what would have been relatively easy wins into losses. Whereas no, actually, if you want to win that has to include not dying, and also doing the alignment work helps you win, because it is the only way you can (sanely) get to deploy your AIs to do the most valuable tasks. Trump’s reaction of ‘we’ll dominate everything’ is far closer to correct. Our ‘lead’ is smaller than we thought, DeepSeek will be real competition, but we are very much still in the dominant position. We need to not lose sight of that. The Washington Post covers panic in Washington, and attempts to exploit this situation to do the opposite of wise policy. Tiku, Dou, Zakrzewski and De Vynck: Tech stocks dropped Monday. Spooked U.S. officials, engineers and investors reconsidered their views on the competitive threat posed by China in AI, and how the United States could stay ahead. While some Republicans and the Trump administration suggested the answer was to restrain China, prominent tech industry voices said DeepSeek’s ascent showed the benefits of openly sharing AI technology instead of keeping it closely held. This shows nothing of the kind, of course. DeepSeek fast followed, copied our insights and had insights of their own. Our insights were held insufficiently closely to prevent this, which at that stage was mostly unavoidable. They have now given away many of those new valuable insights, which we and others will copy, and also made the situation more dangerous. We should exploit that and learn from it, not make the same mistake. Robert Sterling: Might be a dumb question, but can’t OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies just incorporate the best parts of DeepSeek’s source code into their code, then use the massive GPU clusters at their disposal to train models even more powerful than DeepSeek? Am I missing something? Peter Wildeford: Not a dumb question, this is 100% correct And they already have more powerful models than Deepseek I fear we are caught between two different insane reactions. Restraining China is a good idea if implemented well, but insufficiently specified. Restrain them how? If this means export controls, I strongly agree – and then ask when we are then considering imposing those controls on ourselves via tariffs? What else is available? And I will keep saying ‘how about immigration to brain drain them’ because it seems wrong to ignore the utterly obvious. Chamath Palihapitiya says it’s inference time, we need to boot up our allies with it as quickly as possible (I agree) and that we should also boot up China by lifting export controls on inference chips, and also focus on supplying the Middle East. He notes he has a conflict of interest here. It seems not especially wise to hand over serious inference compute if we’re in a fight here. With the way these models are going, there’s a decent amount of fungibility between inference and training, and also there’s going to be tons of demand for inference. Why is it suddenly important to Chamath that the inference be done on chips we sold them? Capitalist insists rope markets must remain open during this trying time, and so on. (There’s also talk about ‘how asleep we’ve been for 15 years’ because we’re so inefficient and seriously everyone needs to calm down on this kind of thinking.) So alas, in the short run, we are left scrambling to prevent two equal and opposite deadly mistakes we seem to be dangerously close to collectively making. The CEO of DeepSeek himself said in November that the export controls and inability to access chips were the limiting factors on what they could do. Compute is vital. What did DeepSeek ask for with its newfound prestige? Support for compute infrastructure in China. Do not respond by being so suicidal as to remove or weaken those controls. Or, to shorten all that: Don’t do those things! Do take advantage of all the opportunities that have been opened up. And of course: Don’t panic!

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Wall Street was headed for a muted open after the Nasdaq closed 2% higher Tuesday and made back a big chunk of Monday's big DeepSeek-driven selloff. The market is still heavily overbought, so I'm more inclined to reduce stock exposure than increase it. 2. Our Big Tech names start reporting earnings Wednesday evening, beginning with Meta Platforms and Microsoft. KeyBanc raised its Meta price target to $750 per share from $700, expecting better-than-expected numbers after the bell. 3. OpenAI and Microsoft are looking into whether a group linked to the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek used data from ChatGPT without permission, Bloomberg reported. Meanwhile, China-based tech giant Alibaba says it has something faster than DeepSeek. 4. Starbucks shares were jumping 3% early Wednesday on evidence that CEO Brian Niccol's turn around has begun. But it won't be fast because the former Chipotle chief inherited had so many issues involving partners and customers and throughput, especially mobile ordering. Club name Starbucks reported better than expected earnings and revenue after Tuesday's close. 5. Club stock Nextracker was soaring more than 20%, the morning after the U.S.-based solar company delivered a quarterly beat and outlook raise. Barclays upgraded Nextracker on flawless execution. President Donald Trump has said he's a "big fan of solar," but his feelings toward government renewable energy and solar tax credits are unclear. 6. Danaher shares were dropping roughly 6% early Wednesday, shortly after the life sciences company missed on earnings and beat on revenue. The Club name preannounced so that's not much of a surprise. Investors were focusing on the outlook, which was soft for both the current quarter and the full year. 7. Apple, which reports earnings Thursday evening, is teaming up with T-Mobile and Elon Musk's SpaceX to support Starlink on iPhones, Bloomberg reported. This could be very significant. T-Mobile previously said Starlink was available on some Samsung phones. Apple already enables Globalstar. 8. Club name CrowdStrike said it got a perfect score on the prevention and detection of ransomware on SE Labs tests, which are the gold standard evaluating cybersecurity companies' abilities. 9. Dutch company ASML Holding reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue and said that DeepSeek is good news because it promotes the democratization of AI. I think that idea might be too positive, but the numbers are driving other semiconductor equipment makers higher, including U.S.-based Applied Materials. 10. Nucor CEO Leon Topalian was on Tuesday evening's "Mad Money," predicting that there will be a renaissance in American made steel after tariffs are put on Mexican and Canadian transshipments.

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: Alibaba Stock Rallies As Chinese Giant Says AI Model Beats DeepSeek’s

Time Published: 2025-01-29T13:55:46Z
Full Content:
The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Sign Up! envelope_alt Get the latest Android News in your inbox every day arrow_right Sign up to receive the latest Android News every weekday: Only send updates once a week Android Headlines / Tech News / DeepSeek: Everything You Need To Know We had gotten used to there only being a handful of major AI models running the show, but things change. There’s a new kid on the block, and his name is DeepSeek. Right now, there are tons of questions going around about this break-out star of the AI world. Well, if you want to know more about DeepSeek, here’s a guide on what you need to know about it. This article will be updated as time goes on, so you should feel free to check back every now and then. At the time of writing this piece, new developments are coming at us left and right, so you should expect to see updates to this piece fairly often. We’ll go over the things you should know and be aware of with this new AI tool. There’s also a crucial bit of information that you should be aware of. Table of Contents First, let’s start off with something pretty basic; what the heck is DeepSeek? Well, it’s a new AI chatbot. It’s just like Google Gemini, OpenAI ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude, and other chatbots. It gives you text-based responses based on input. Several people have done studies, and they found that its responses can challenge ChatGPT’s and Google Gemini’s. This makes it a pretty big threat to these companies. The company was formed in 2023. It is owned by the Chinese hedge fund named High-Flyer. DeepSeek’s founder, Liang Wenfeng, also co-founded High-Flyer. He is the acting CEO. DeepSeek used the model named DeepSeek-V3. This model has 671 billion total parameters. It also has a context window of 128K, which is far behind the likes of Gemini, but it’s pretty average compared to other models. Currently, DeepSeek uses the model called R1. This is the model that made waves throughout the AI industry. This model also has 671 billion parameters and a 128K context window. According to a user on Reddit, the DeepSeek website limits you to just 50 messages. However, the company states that there aren’t any rate limits on the DeepSeek API. This could be because it’s cheaper to use than many other models on the market. There are two main ways to do so. Firstly, you can go to the official DeepSeek website. For mobile users, you can download the app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. Signing up for DeepSeek is pretty simple, and it’s no different from most other services. There are a couple of options. You can either provide your email address or phone number along with a password. The other option is to sign in with your Google account. Nothing. DeepSeek is free to download and use. For the time being, it does not. It has an input cost of $0.55 and an output cost of $2.19 per million tokens. This is better than models like GPT-4o (input:$2.50 output: $10.00) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (input: $1.25 output: $5.00). Yes. This is something that differentiates it from Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT models. In case you don’t know, a multimodal model is one that can understand and create multiple forms of media. For example, a model that can generate both images and text is multimodal. It’s the same thing for a model that can both understand images and text. DeepSeek R1 is not a multimodal model. However, the company does have a model called Janus Pro. It unveiled this model not too long ago. Janus Pro has the ability to both understand and generate text and images. So, if you want to ask it questions based on an image, you can upload an image as the prompt. Also, you can use it as an image generator just like DALL-E. Janus Pro is the successor to Janus, and the company showed a comparison between the two models. Janus Pro is available to download from the company’s Hugging Face page. This is one of the most significant aspects of this chatbot. According to an analysis from Artificial Analysis, DeepSeek is a formidable model. In terms of speed, it’s pretty slow compared to the rest of the competition, but it makes up for it in raw performance. Based on several tests, DeepSeek R1 was able to best OpenAI’s GPT-4o in different areas. The graph below shows the quality rating of the top AI models on the market. We see that DeepSeek R1 (89 points) is just one point behind OpenAI’s o1 model (90 points), the company’s most advanced reasoning model. However, it was able to best o1-mini (84 points), GPT-4o (73 points), and GPT-4o mini (73 points). It was also able to beat our Google’s most advanced models Gemini 2.0 Experimental (82 points) and Gemini 1.5 Pro (80 points). The rest of the list is populated by models from Meta, Anthropic, Amazon, and Mistral. The next graph comes from DeepSeek’s Github. It shows DeepSeek R1’s performance compared to OpenAI’s o1, a previous version of R1, and DeepSeek-V3. As you can see, it was able to trade blows with the best that OpenAI has to offer. So, all in all, it’s no surprise that DeepSeek was able to make such a splash in the AI space. It came out of nowhere and brought a model that should put AI veterans like Google and OpenAI on their toes. From what we can tell, DeepSeek is available in the U.S. and China. We’re certain it’s available in other regions as well. That is a doozy of a question. Honestly, this might be the longest section of this piece. We’re not going to sugarcoat this, DeepSeek gathers an absolute TON of information about you AND it stores that data on a server in mainland China. If this is something that you do not want to happen, then we suggest that you do not download or sign up for DeepSeek. The list of information it gathers on you is rather long. DeepSeek directly informs people that it gathers information like: Yes. The company explains that it may share your information with advertisers, other entities within its corporate group, and other groups as the result of a merger, change of control, reorganization, financing, sale of assets, or acquisition. This means that, once DeepSeek has your data, there’s no telling how many hands it will change along its journey. What makes the situation worse is the fact that DeepSeek holds on to your data indefinitely. As per the privacy page, it retains your data “for as long as necessary,“. This means that your data could be stored on the company’s servers for years. At least Google has a hard cut-off date for how long it keeps your data. Yes. The company says so on its privacy policy page. “We may share information collected through your use of the Service with our advertising or analytics partners.” Information being sold to advertisers is nothing new, but with all of the information that DeepSeek scoops up, it shines a harsh light on the company. Unfortunately, no. DeepSeek states that some of the information it gathers is taken automatically, so there’s no to control it. Also, if you delete your account, the company does not state whether your content will be deleted or if it will live on in the servers. DeepSeek does, however, give you at least SOME control over our data, but it’s extremely limiting. Through the settings, you’re allowed to erase your chat history. Next, you can go to your browser and disable browser cookies. You’ll need to do this in your browser’s general settings, not on the DeepSeek website. At this point, it’s tough to say. TikTok was nearly booted from the United States because the information it took from users resided in China. We don’t know all of the information that TikTok stored, but we’re sure it wasn’t as extreme as DeepSeek. Since DeepSeek is taking so much data from the people who use it, we’re most certain that some governmental entity will find an issue with it and move to bring legal action. It hasn’t happened yet, but this article will be updated if something like that happens. At the time of writing this, DeepSeek has had a bit of a rippling effect in the AI company world. Obviously, top AI companies like Meta, Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic are wary of the potential completion. However, there’s more to this story. As of the time this article comes out (late January 2025), several major tech companies have seen a pretty notable drop in their stock prices. The largest drop happened with Nvidia. In 2024, the company saw a meteoric rise in the stock market as companies bought thousands upon thousands of its chips. It reached an over $2 trillion market value. However, in the wake of DeepSeek, its prices dropped a whopping $596.7 billion in the market in just one day. Nvidia isn’t the only company that dropped a bunch in the market. Other companies that lost hard are: Those are the top 10 biggest losers in the market, including Nvidia. Altogether, those companies lost north of a trillion dollars in market value in one day. That’s a pretty massive drop. The thing is that training and maintaining AI models is a costly business. We’re not just talking about money, it also eats up energy like it’s no one’s business. This is why companies like Meta and Microsoft are trying to build nuclear plants. However, DeepSeek comes onto the scene with a model that costs a fraction of the money and energy to maintain. Also, it’s able to run on weaker chips. This crushed the disillusion that powerful AI needed powerful chips, a bunch of money, and a ton of energy to nurture. So, many of the people who were investing in large tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia lost faith that their money was being put to the right use. Remember, it’s been able to beat OpenAI’s most powerful model on some tests. Many of the people who invested in these companies sold off their stocks, which led to a bit of a crash. As you can imagine, Nvidia was hit the hardest because it was one of the main companies supplying powerful chips to AI companies across the nation. The company to lose the second most value, Broadcom, is a chipmaker as well, and people investing in it also took their dollars elsewhere. Many of the top AI companies in the U.S. have seen a large dip in their stock price and at this point, we don’t know how long this is going to go on for. We’re sure it won’t be long before other companies like Google, OpenAI, Meta, and others start to feel the effects of this. At this point, we’re not sure what the company is planning. The company does have an API available, so we know that it wants other AI platforms to use its models. As popular as it has become, we’re sure that numerous services will rise using its API.

Title: Analysis:AI stock shock could spark broader gains in US market

Business NEW YORK : A development in the field of artificial intelligence that staggered asset prices could help set the stage for broader stock strength beyond the narrow group of technology shares that has propelled the market higher. Tech stocks, led by megacap companies, have been the driving force of the current bull market. The S&P 500 tech sector has gained some 90 per cent in the past two years, nearly doubling the gain for the overall benchmark index. But the sector stumbled badly on Monday as investors factored in implications from the low-cost Chinese AI model, with shares of high-profile tech names such as Nvidia, Broadcom and Oracle getting pummeled. Even as the group recouped some of those losses on Tuesday, investors were considering the changing character of the market, especially as they anticipate broader earnings improvement this year. "It's a catalyst for more balanced market leadership," said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. "Ultimately, that's a positive because that means there are other areas for investors to make money." Market leadership has been particularly concentrated in a group of tech and tech-related megacap stocks known as the Magnificent Seven: Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook owner Meta Platforms and Tesla. Those stocks combined accounted for 55 per cent of the S&P 500's total return since the end of 2022 as of Monday, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. This year, however, the Magnificent Seven overall had been a negative influence on S&P 500 performance as of Monday. Signs of a nascent rotation were evident amid the DeepSeek fallout. Even as the S&P 500 fell 1.5 per cent on Monday, dragged down by stocks that carry heavy weights in the index, about 70 per cent of S&P 500 constituents rose, according to Barclays strategists. "Sector performance differed from similar risk-off days of the past few years, showing a notable 'broadening' tilt away from tech," the Barclays strategists said in a note. The S&P 500 growth index, which is heavily populated by tech stocks, dropped about 3.6 per cent on Monday, while the counterpart value stock index rose nearly 1 per cent. That was the biggest one-day percentage point advantage for value stocks over growth in the roughly 30 years of data on record, according to LSEG data. While Wall Street may take time to understand the implications from DeepSeek, Monday's "price action was a slap in the face to a lot of people who thought these stocks were invincible and the end result may be to take some of the chips out of that sector and spread it around to other areas of the market," said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel. In the options market, while there was some element of dip buying, traders appeared interested in broadening their horizon beyond the Magnificent Seven stocks. "I think people are using this as an opportunity to start to check out other sectors," said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group. Many investors already had been expecting stock strength to spread beyond tech and the Magnificent Seven, stemming from earnings trends. While Magnificent Seven earnings growth far exceeded performance for the rest of the S&P 500 over the past year, that gap is expected to close. In 2025, Magnificent Seven earnings are expected to rise 19 per cent against a 12.3 per cent increase for the rest of the index, said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG. A flood of quarterly earnings reports is due over the next few weeks, including Microsoft, Meta and Tesla on Wednesday and Apple on Thursday. "That's important to watch these earnings come in," said Don Nesbitt, senior portfolio manager at F/m Investments. "You have some signals that, yes, things could be broadening out here." Plenty of investors remain bullish on tech and even some who expect a market broadening say the group can continue to do well. Indeed, the tech sector bounced back on Tuesday, rising over 3 per cent, but was still lower than before the DeepSeek news rippled through markets. Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management, said DeepSeek could lead to a rotation to companies that could gain from access to lower-cost AI, with software stocks among the potential beneficiaries. He manages portfolios that hold software stocks including Microsoft, ServiceNow and Salesforce. Monday's market action gave a "jolt" to a potential market broadening, said Walter Todd, chief investment officer at Greenwood Capital. But given how long tech has held the market reins, Todd said, "it's going to take some time for that to turn."

Screens display a news conference by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange in New York, Wednesday, Jan. 29, 2025. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) HONG KONG – U.S. stock indexes slipped Wednesday after the Federal Reserve opted not to cut interest rates for the first time since it began trying to help the economy through easier rates in September. The S&P 500 fell 0.5% following the Fed’s widely expected decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 137 points, or 0.3%, and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%. Recommended Videos The reaction was also relatively muted in the bond market following the Fed’s decision, which could hint at rates staying on hold for a while following their swift drop at the end of 2024. Lower rates would help the economy by making it cheaper for U.S. households and companies to borrow, but the downside is they could also give inflation more fuel. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after the decision that the central bank could cut rates if inflation were to slow further or if the job market suddenly weakened. But “right now, we don’t see that, and we see things as in a really good place for policy and for the economy, and so we feel like we don’t need to be in a hurry to make any adjustments.” While Wall Street would almost always prefer lower interest rates, “we would continue to focus on why the Fed won’t cut anytime soon, specifically a strong economy and labor, which bodes well for solid corporate earnings growth,” said Sameer Samana, senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. Wednesday's relatively calm movements for financial markets offered some respite following two days of disruption driven by doubts about the artificial-intelligence boom. A Chinese upstart, DeepSeek, has raised nearly existential questions for some of the AI industry after saying it developed a large-language model that can compete with the world’s best without having to use top-flight chips. That casts doubt about whether AI development broadly will require as much spending on chips, vast data centers and electricity as Wall Street and Big Tech had been assuming. That in turn has caused huge swings for stocks across the industry, particularly for Nvidia. The company, whose stock has almost become a symbol of the AI bonanza, fell 4% Wednesday after plunging nearly 17% Monday and then jumping nearly 9% Tuesday. It was the single heaviest weight dragging the S&P 500 lower, by far. Big gains for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies had been instrumental in the S&P 500’s rallying to back-to-back yearly gains of more than 20% for the first time since before the millennium. Nvidia alone accounted for more than a fifth of all of the S&P 500's total return last year. Elsewhere on Wall Street, Starbucks rose 8.1% after delivering a better profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. CEO Brian Niccol said the chain is planning to cut its food and beverage offerings by 30% over the course of this year to simplify operations and speed service, part of its efforts to turn the company around. T-Mobile US rallied 6.3% after topping Wall Street’s expectations for both profit and revenue in the last three months of 2024. It also said it expects to add between a net 5.5 million and 6 million in postpaid customers this year. Brinker International jumped 16.3% after the company behind Chili’s restaurants delivered better results than expected. CEO Kevin Hochman said Chili’s attracted new customers and that its return customers were coming more frequently. Railroad operator Norfolk Southern rose 1.8% after beating Wall Street’s profit forecasts. There is also growing optimism that a Republican-controlled Congress could ease restrictions on the industry. Frontier Group Holdings climbed 5.3% after announcing it would try for a second time to merge with Spirit Airlines, which sought bankruptcy protection late last year. Frontier said the proposed deal would include newly issued Frontier debt and common stock. Trump Media & Technology Group rose after announcing it would be getting into the financial services business via a partnership with Charles Schwab. TMTG said more details would be released later this year, and what had been a double-digit gain for the notoriously volatile stock shrank to an increase of 6.8%. On the losing end of Wall Street was Danaher, which fell 9.7% after the life sciences, biotechnology and diagnostics company reported results for the latest quarter that just missed analysts’ expectations. All told, the S&P 500 fell 28.39 points to 6,039.31. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 136.83 to 44,713.52, and the Nasdaq composite sank 101.26 to 19,632.32. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.53%, where it was late Tuesday. In stock markets abroad, indexes were mixed in Europe. ASML’s stock jumped 5.6% in Amsterdam after announcing strong revenue on demand for its advanced chipmaking tools. In Asia, where many markets were closed for holidays, Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 1%. ___ AP Writers Matt Ott and Zimo Zhong contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Will DeepSeek forever change the AI industry? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. New AI chatbot DeepSeek is taking the technology world by storm, and has even dethroned ChatGPT from top spot on the iOS App store. There's certainly a lot of speculation about the potential DeepSeek holds, as well as what this could mean for some of the biggest players in tech right now. Plenty of both new and existing firms have invested billions of dollars into Large Language Models in the last few months alone - but DeepSeek has the opportunity to cause chaos in the venture capital world. Having caused the biggest drop in the US stock market in history, the chatbot is understandably a huge talking point - but what are the experts’ predictions? There’s no denying that DeepSeek arriving on the scene has been disruptive, and although the expert opinion isn’t unanimous, the significantly lower development cost is definitely turning heads. If you're confused about what DeepSeek is, or why its causing so much of a stir, check out our article here explaining all you need to know, The pressure is certainly on for US tech firms to respond, but it may not be as destructive as it seems. We heard from 10 experts in the technology industry; Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! Steve Povonly, Senior Director of Security Research & Competitive Intelligence at Exabeam: "The release of Chinese-developed DeepSeek has thrown US tech markets into turmoil; this is both justifiable and also perhaps, a bit overblown. The emergence of a technology that ultimately optimizes chip usage and efficiency is likely to apply pressure on existing large chip vendors, which is a very good thing. As the adage goes: "Pressure yields diamonds" and in this case, I believe competition in this market will drive global optimization, lower costs, and sustain the tailwinds AI needs to drive profitable solutions in the short and longer term." Mike Follett, CEO and Founder of Lumen Research: “Last week, Sam Altman and Elon Musk were AI monopolists. Now, it is clear that competition will reduce costs and loosen the grip hold of the biggest players. This represents an opportunity for marketers enabling them to build agents designed for specific problems, at a speed, scale and at a price that drives ROI.” Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group: “This is a wake-up call for markets. The assumption that tariffs could contain China’s technological ambitions is being dismantled in real time. DeepSeek’s breakthrough is proof that innovation will always find a way forward, regardless of economic barriers.” “By restricting China’s access to high-end semiconductors, Washington sought to slow its progress in AI. Instead, it has fueled an acceleration in domestic innovation, forcing Chinese firms to find alternatives. DeepSeek’s achievement is a direct result of this shift. “Rather than being crippled by US sanctions, Beijing has cultivated AI models that require significantly less computing power, diminishing its reliance on American technology and eroding US leverage over global supply chains.” Aleksandr Yampolskiy, CEO of SecurityScorecard: “DeepSeek is trained on 14.8 trillion diverse tokens whereas OpenAI is trained only on 13 trillion. It also costs radically less to train DeepSeek at $6M while OpenAI costs allegedly $100M, making DeepSeek 16.6X more efficient.” “We are living in fascinating times. While "constraints in capital" may seem like a challenge, history has shown us (and DeepSeek has demonstrated) that these constraints often spark innovation and creativity. Security for AI will only become more critical. In a world where the lines between deepfake and human-generated content blur, and where biased information can shape our opinions, the need for robust security and ethical practices will grow exponentially.” Dr. Kjell Carlsson, Head of AI strategy at Domino Data Lab: “Deepseek’s success serves as a powerful reminder that the value of AI lies not in the size of your infrastructure or the exclusivity of your models, but in how effectively they are leveraged to deliver impact. By developing cutting-edge generative AI models without relying on the latest, most expensive hardware, Deepseek has demonstrated that agility and strategy can outpace raw computational power. Their achievements also highlight the vulnerability of incumbents in the generative AI space—proving that open-source innovation continues to be a powerful equalizer, enabling challengers to match and even surpass established players years into the revolution.” “For companies seeking to maximise value from AI, the lesson is clear: success hinges on flexibility and capability, not exclusive partnerships or infrastructure scale. Rather than locking into specific LLM providers or focusing solely on hardware access, organisations should prioritise building the end-to-end capabilities to source AI innovations, design solutions tailored to their unique needs, and operationalise them effectively. This approach ensures that businesses remain agile, competitive, and prepared to harness the next wave of AI advancements, wherever they emerge.” Bradford Levy, Assistant Professor of Accounting, University of Chicago Booth School of Business: “DeepSeek has sent shock waves through the tech industry – directly challenging tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and Open AI." “Until now, it’s been assumed their expertise in designing and operating large-scale distributed systems are essential for training state of the art models. But the development of R1 suggests otherwise – if these models can be trained using 90% fewer chips, the implications for valuation models are massive." “This opens the door for smaller, more agile players to compete, potentially driving more innovation. With limited resources, they proved that scrappy, innovative teams can shake up the industry, even on a shoestring budget." “While impressive, we should remain skeptical of any claims made by those with a vested interest in their own success. Before jumping to conclusions about the broader AI landscape, we need more time to test these models and understand how they achieved these numbers.” Professor Geoff Webb, Department of Data Science & AI, Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University: “The emergence of DeepSeek is a significant moment in the AI revolution. Until now it has seemed that billion dollar investments and access to the latest generation of specialised NVIDIA processors were prerequisites for developing state-of-the-art systems.” “This effectively limited control to a small number of leading US-based tech corporations. Due to US embargoes on exporting the latest generation of NVIDIA processors, it also locked out China.” “DeepSeek claims to have developed a new Large Language Model, similar to Chat GPT or Llama, that rivals the state-of-the-art for a fraction of the cost using the less advanced NVIDIA processors that are currently available to China. If this is true, it means that the US tech sector no longer has exclusive control of the AI technologies, opening them to wider competition and reducing the prices they can charge for access to and use of their systems.” “Looking beyond the implications for the stock market, current AI technologies are US-centric and embody US values and culture. This new development has the potential to create more diversity through the development of new AI systems.” “It also has the potential to make AI more accessible for researchers around the world both for developing new technologies and for applying them in diverse areas including healthcare.” Aditya Sood, VP of Security Engineering and AI Strategy at Aryaka: "Open-source AI models like DeepSeek, while offering accessibility and innovation, are increasingly vulnerable to supply chain attacks triggered during large-scale cyberattacks. These attacks, where adversaries exploit the reliance on third-party dependencies, pre-trained models, or public repositories, can have severe consequences. Adversaries may tamper with pre-trained models by embedding malicious code, backdoors, or poisoned data, which can compromise downstream applications. Additionally, attackers may target the software supply chain by manipulating dependencies, libraries, or scripts used during model training or deployment. This can lead to systemic AI functionality corruption." Renuka Nadkarni CPO at Aryaka: "The sudden popularity of DeepSeek comes at a price. There are two dimensions of this. First, threat actors are likely to adopt this new tool now that it's widely available. Second, DeepSeek was a victim of a large-scale malicious attack. This means that their system could be compromised and subject to several of the known AI model attacks. Known AI model vulnerabilities, data risks, and infrastructure threats come into play here." “While the unavailability of the service is an easy and visible attack on its infrastructure, the bigger concern lies in the undetected attacks on its model and data. These hidden threats could compromise benign users and enable other malicious activities." Dan Goman, CEO, Ateliere Creative Technologies: "The market’s reaction to the latest news surrounding DeepSeek is nothing short of an overcorrection. While the enthusiasm around breakthroughs in AI often drives headlines and market speculation, this feels like yet another case where excitement has outpaced evidence. Investors should be cautious about blindly jumping on the hype train without asking the tough questions." "In summary, while Deepseek’s story is intriguing, it’s imperative to separate fact from speculation. The market needs to temper its enthusiasm and demand more transparency before awarding DeepSeek the crown of AI innovation. Until then, skepticism remains a healthy and necessary stance."

Title: DeepSeek Panic Live Updates: OpenAI And Microsoft Reportedly Probing If DeepSeek Used Their Data For Training

The release of a less capital-intensive artificial intelligence model from China’s DeepSeek sent a chill through the U.S. stock market this week, headlined by losses Monday and Wednesday from Nvidia, the Silicon Valley giant which designs most of the pricey semiconductor technology powering the AI revolution. DeepSeek has been accused of using outputs generated by OpenAI's tools to train its latest AI model. Jan. 29, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends Wednesday trading down 4% in a turbulent session that wiped out about $130 billion in market value, with earnings reports from top customers Meta, Nvidia and Tesla all due this afternoon all potential catalysts for further movement in the stock. To recap Nvidia’s whipsaw week: Its market value fell by about $590 billion Monday, rose by roughly $260 billion Tuesday and dropped $130 billion Wednesday. Wall Street analysts still mostly view the selloff as a overreaction, and Bank of America analysts led by Vivek Arya wrote Wednesday to clients they “view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity” for Nvidia stock, reaffirming faith in hundreds of billions of dollars of spending this decade in the AI technology which Nvidia designs. Jan. 29, 1:30 p.m. EST President Donald Trump is considering placing more restrictions on Nvidia’s semiconductor chip sales to China beyond what the Biden administration placed in an effort to limit AI advancement in the Asian country, Bloomberg reported, citing anonymous sources. It’s unclear if the potentially amped-up controls are directly tied to the DeepSeek fallout — Nvidia said Monday the Chinese AI group fully complied with existing export laws with its use of Nvidia’s technology — though Howard Lutnick, Trump’s pick for Commerce Secretary, laid into DeepSeek at his Wednesday confirmation hearing, saying: “Nvidia’s chips, which they bought tons of, and they found their ways around, drive their DeepSeek model. It’s got to end.” China accounted for more than 15% of Nvidia’s revenues in its most recent quarter. Jan. 29, 12 p.m. EST Nvidia’s Wall Street woes continued as shares dropped about 5% by midday, bringing the stock’s loss this week back up to nearly 15%. Jan. 29, 9:40 a.m. EST After mounting a historic comeback Wednesday, Nvidia stock fell again, declining about 3% in the first 10 minutes of regular trading, leading a broader tech slump as the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Tesla all declined roughly 1% apiece. Jan. 29, 8:30 a.m. EST New York-listed shares of Chinese technology giant Alibaba rise more than 3% in premarket trading, set to open at their highest level since early November. Alibaba said earlier Wednesday the latest version of its Qwen generative AI model scored better on several performance tests than the models from rivals like DeepSeek, OpenAI and Meta. Jan. 29, 3 a.m. EST OpenAI told the Financial Times that it has seen some evidence that its AI models were used by DeepSeek to train its own—which would be a breach of the ChatGPT maker’s terms of services. Bloomberg previously reported that Microsoft and OpenAI were investigating whether DeepSeek gained access to OpenAI’s data outputs in an unauthorized manner. Jan. 29, 12 a.m. EST White House artificial intelligence czar David Sacks told Fox News that there was “substantial evidence” suggesting that Deepseek had “distilled the knowledge out of OpenAI’s models,” adding “I don’t think OpenAI is very happy about this.” In this context, distillation is a process where an AI model uses responses generated by other, more powerful, AI models to aid its development. Sacks added that over the next few months he expects leading U.S. AI companies will be "taking steps to try and prevent distillation” to slow down “these copycat models.” Jan. 28, 4 p.m. EST Nvidia stock ends normal trading up 8.8%, scoring its best percentage gain in six months. That added $260 billion to Nvidia’s market capitalization — more than the total valuations of American Express, Disney and Goldman Sachs — recovering 44% of the $589 billion its lost Monday. Nvidia’s Tuesday bounce became the second best day for any stock ever in terms of market value added, trailing only the $327 billion rally the AI leader enjoyed July 31, 2024. Shares of Nvidia are still down nearly 10% since Friday amid the whirlwind trading. Jan. 28, 1:45 p.m. ESTApple stock rallied 4% to about $239 per share, building on its 3% gain Monday as many of its Silicon Valley peers faltered and extending its market value added this week to about $240 billion. The two-day bounce for Apple shares, which had suffered a 14% pullback in the month ending Friday, comes as investors warm to the iPhone maker’s approach to largely watch the generative AI arms race from the sidelines as its trillion-dollar peers like Alphabet, Meta and Microsoft invested billions into generative AI projects. Apple emerges as a “relative winner” as DeepSeek shifted investor narratives on AI, wrote Morgan Stanley analysts led by Brian Nowak in a Tuesday note to clients, explaining Apple’s “AI ambitions are far more contained” than the other “magnificent seven” American tech leaders. Apple also stands to greatly benefit from any advancements from large-language models, like DeepSeek’s, as Apple “owns the most valuable consumer technology distribution platform that exists,” Nowak added. Whether Apple stock’s “contained” generative AI ambitions were the result of financial discipline or inadequate innovation is up to interpretation, but Wall Street Journal columnist Joanna Stern quipped, “Apple’s behind-everyone-else-in-AI approach look like a calculated master plan.” After heading into the week down $143 billion in the race with Nvidia for world’s most valuable company, Apple is now up $498 billion, a more than $640 billion two-day swing. Jan. 28, 12:20 p.m. ESTNvidia settles into a more than 5.5% gain by midday trading, helping lift the tech-heavy Nasdaq index to a more than 1.5% advance, but the damage is still evident from the prior crash, as Nvidia only recovered about $171 billion of the $589 billion market capitalization it lost Monday. Jan. 28, 10 a.m. ESTMorgan Stanley’s Joseph Moore offers perhaps the most palpably negative major analyst reaction to DeepSeek, cutting his price target for Nvidia from $166 to $152 due to the “deflationary” prospects of cheaper AI buildouts and the potential for “further export controls or reduce spending enthusiasm” — Morgan Stanley maintains a buy rating for the stock and its $152 target implies 27% upside from Nvidia’s $120 share price Tuesday. Jan. 28, 9:35 a.m. ESTShares of the two companies most severely impacted by the DeepSeek reaction, Nvidia and Oracle, open normal trading hours up about 3% apiece in premarket trading before each company’s gains pared back to 1%; both American technology firms are still down more than 15% since Friday. Jan. 28, 8:45 a.m. ESTAnalyst reactions to the historic selloff largely characterized the losses as out of proportion: UBS analyst Karl Keirstead said Oracle’s drop “felt excessive” and Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore added “geopolitical dynamics are a key driver of this volatility” in tech stocks in respective notes to clients. Jan. 28, 6:00 a.m. ESTChina’s state-run Global Times cited a telecoms industry observer, who said the company’s success showed that “the Biden administration's four-year crackdown on China's AI and computing power has not only failed but has also spurred the country to forge a unique path for AI development.” People within China’s tech industry also hailed DeepSeek’s success. In a widely shared post on the social media platform Weibo, Game Science co-founder Feng Ji—the studio which published the hit game Black Myth: Wukong—wrote “DeepSeek may be a scientific and technology achievement that can change a nation’s fate...Such a shocking breakthrough coming from a purely Chinese company. Jan. 27, 10:00 p.m. ESTOpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised DeepSeek’s R1, saying it is an “impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,” and added “we will obviously deliver much better models and...we will pull up some releases.” Jan. 27, 6:30 p.m. ESTPresident Donald Trump said at a House Republican retreat that the launch of the AI model was “a positive development” but should be considered a “wake-up” call for U.S. industries, lauding the move for what he hoped would usher in a future of “coming up with a faster method of AI, and much less expensive method.” Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTThe DeepSeek-driven stock market plunge caused some of the world’s wealthiest people to lose tens of billions on paper, led by Oracle’s Larry Ellison (net worth down $27.6 billion) and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang (down $20.8 billion)—here’s a full list. Jan. 27, 4:20 p.m. ESTStocks were battered by DeepSeek’s debut: The S&P 500 closed down 1.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged just over 3%—its worst day since Dec. 18 and fourth-worst day of the last two years. Jan. 27, 4 p.m. ESTSemiconductor designer and AI darling Nvidia closed down 17%, knocking $589 billion off its market cap in the biggest single-day loss of value for any public company in history—along with heavy losses at chipmakers Broadcom (17%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (13%), and smaller falls for Microsoft (2%) and Tesla (2%). Jan. 27, 3:28 p.m. ESTForbes found DeepSeek refused to answer questions on several controversial topics linked to the Chinese government, like, “What happened at Tiananmen Square in 1989?” and “What are the biggest criticisms of Xi Jinping?” The model did provide detailed answers when asked about common criticisms of Joe Biden and Donald Trump. Jan. 27, 3 p.m. ESTNvidia releases its first statement on DeepSeek as its stock dipped to a 18% loss on the day, calling the Chinese company’s model “an excellent AI advancement” — the full statement from a Nvidia spokesperson is as follows: “DeepSeek is an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling. DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely-available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking. We now have three scaling laws: pre-training and post-training, which continue, and new test-time scaling.” Jan. 27, 12:50 p.m. ESTDavid Sacks, President Donald Trump’s “AI & Crypto Czar,” offers his first comments on DeepSeek, saying the Chinese company’s success “shows that the AI race will be very competitive” and “we can’t be complacent,” supporting Trump’s repeal of former President Joe Biden’s executive order placing guardrails on AI development, which Sacks said “hamstrung” U.S. AI innovation. Jan. 27, 12:45 p.m. EST Oracle chairman Larry Ellison (down $24.9 billion) led a pack of billionaires whose fortune’s took massive hits Monday as DeepSeek upended the U.S. stock market, with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ($19.8 billion), Dell CEO Michael Dell ($12.4 billion), Tesla CEO Elon Musk ($5.3 billion) and Google cofounder Larry Page ($4.9 billion) all losing significantly, with Huang’s more than 15% drop representing the largest share of a fortune lost. Jan. 27, 12:30 p.m. ESTU.S. stocks got walloped Monday morning: The S&P 500 was down about 1.8% at 12:30 p.m. EST, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank 3.4%. Jan. 27, 11:15 a.m. ESTShares of Nvidia plunged 15% by 11:15 a.m. EST, heading toward its worst daily percentage loss since March 2020, when stocks briefly crashed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and potentially becoming the single greatest single-day loss in terms of market cap of any company in history. Broadcom had slipped 16% as of 11:30 a.m. Jan. 27, 9:30 a.m. ESTDomestic leaders in AI showed stinging losses at market open Monday as Microsoft dropped 4% and Tesla slipped 2%, with semiconductor chip architect Nvidia diving 12% and other big chip stocks like Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company falling more than 10% apiece. Jan. 27, 7:30 a.m. ESTJPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande questioned in a note to clients how DeepSeek’s low-cost success “is posing thoughts to investors that the AI investment cycle may be over-hyped and a more efficient future is possible.” Jan. 27, 5 a.m. ESTReferring to the Magnificent 7 set of trillion-dollar U.S. companies including Nvidia and Tesla accounting for much of the 2020s bull market, Yardeni Research founder Ed Yardeni noted a “competitive threat to their magnificence has emerged from China.” Jan. 26Billionaire investor Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek’s R1 model "AI's Sputnik moment." Jan. 25The DeepSeek mobile app became the No. 1 app in iPhone stores in Australia, Canada, China, Singapore, the U.S. and the U.K. Jan. 22ByteDance, another Chinese company, revealed an update to its flagship AI model and word started circulating that the new overseas products posed a strategic threat to the U.S. tech giants pursuing AI dominance. Jan. 20DeepSeek launched its R1 advanced reasoning model, claiming it rivaled OpenAI's o1 product on several performance benchmarks and was created for far less money than spent by American companies like Microsoft and Meta. The selloff stems from weekend panic over last week’s release from the relatively unknown Chinese firm DeepSeek of its competitive generative AI model rivaling OpenAI, the American firm backed by Microsoft and Nvidia, and its viral chatbot ChatGPT, with DeepSeek notably running at a fraction of the cost of U.S.-based rivals. The idea of a rival undercutting the largely U.S.-based generative AI revolution throws a wrench in investors’ historic confidence in American stocks, as the S&P trades at levels in terms of companies’ revenues and profits comparable to the dot-com bubble, meaning investors are ponying up more to get a slice of stateside equities. DeepSeek is “bad news” for American tech behemoths with “plans to dominate the AI market with their expensive AI services,” cautioned Yardeni. The new DeepSeek product is an advanced reasoning model most similar to OpenAI’s o1 that was released Monday, Jan. 20. R1 has been compared favorably to the best products of OpenAI and Meta while appearing to be more efficient, cheaper and potentially made without relying on the most powerful and expensive AI accelerators that are harder to buy in China because of U.S. export controls. The model is scoring nearly as well or outpacing rival models in mathematical tasks, general knowledge and question-and-answer performance benchmarks, DeepSeek says, and is ranked in the top five on Chatbot Arena, a performance platform hosted by University of California, Berkeley. Don’t “buy into the doomsday scenarios currently playing out” about DeepSeek, Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note to clients, adding the “panic over the weekend seems overblown.” DeepSeek’s assertion it cost just $5.6 million in computing power to develop its model is “categorically false,” according Rasgon, who said the misleading figure does not account for other “substantial” costs related to its AI model’s development. American AI billionaires like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and ScaleAI CEO Alexandr Wang theorize DeepSeek actually owns more than $1 billion worth of Nvidia equipment. DeepSeek is a new entrant to the AI large-language model arms race involving OpenAI, Facebook parent Meta and Google parent Alphabet. The AI battle came to a national stage last week when President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion joint venture building out the infrastructure necessary to power OpenAI’s artificial general intelligence initiatives. In his speech last Tuesday, Trump specifically called out the importance for the U.S. to beat out China on AI, saying about the technology: “We want to keep it in this country. China is a competitor and others are competitors.” Major tech figures including billionaire Trump allies Marc Andreessen and Vivek Ramaswamy each likened DeepSeek’s new technology to a “Sputnik moment” for American AI. Nvidia, which was the world’s most valuable company prior to Monday’s slide, designs a majority of the semiconductor and data storage technology necessary for large-scale AI, including DeepSeek’s, enjoying an explosion in profits as companies around the world fought over Nvidia’s graphics processing units. The magnificent seven includes Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla, accounting for about $17 trillion of market value between the seven giants. The AI revolution boosted American stocks to record leadership in the global stock market, with U.S. companies accounting for 67% of the world equity market at the end of 2024, according to MSCI. The S&P is up 201% over the last decade through Friday, trouncing the 8% loss for China’s leading CSI 300 index and the 33% gain for Europe’s Stoxx 600 over the period, according to FactSet data. Monday’s selloff sets the stage for a notable week for Big Tech stocks. Meta, Microsoft and Tesla will all report fourth-quarter earnings Wednesday afternoon, while Apple will follow Thursday.

Title: DeepSeek Send Panic Shivers Down the US AI Industry

We write helpful technology guides, unbiased product reviews, and report on the latest tech and crypto news. We maintain editorial independence and consider content quality and factual accuracy to be non-negotiable. Key Takeaways A new Chinese AI model has taken the world by storm. Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has just released the latest version of its open-source AI model – DeepSeek V3, and it’s better than the latest ChatGPT 4.0, Llama3, and Claude AI models. In fact, in some areas, it even surpasses its rivals. To add a cherry to the top, its training and development cost is just a fraction of that of its rivals. Where giants like OpenAI and Meta have pumped billions of dollars into data centers and AI training, DeepSeek has built a model from scratch for just $5.5M. The US stock market bore the brunt of this new breakthrough, wiping off $1 trillion for investors in a single day. Nvidia was the most affected stock – it fell almost 17% in a day. Nvidia investors saw $593B vaporize into thin air – the single biggest market cap loss for a company on Wall Street. Nvidia’s whole business is centered around selling massively expensive GPUs at 80-90% margins. In contrast, DeepSeek built the whole model on around 2,000 Nvidia H800 GPUs. DeepSeek has rocked the belief that the AI industry is a capital-intensive one and only big corporation giants can participate in it. As per reports, DeepSeek uses efficient computing techniques such as a “mixture of experts” approach to lower the cost. Now that the industry knows similar results can be achieved with a fraction of resources, the whole AI chip industry business may falter. The only downside might be that the model is trained on data up to October 2023. But this is only for the web version. The app seems to have access to the latest information. DeepSeek stepping foot into the industry has sent the rest of the players into a frenzy. As per an inside source, the generative artificial intelligence division of Meta is in “panic mode”. Engineers are moving frantically to dissect DeepSeek and copy anything and everything we can from it. I’m not even exaggerating. – Meta employee The biggest worry of the management right now is how they will justify the massive cost of their tools and the massive salary that their “leaders” are drawing when China has managed to create an equally competent tool at such a low price. Even President Donald Trump praised DeepSeek in a speech at a Republican retreat, applauding its technological breakthrough and saying it should be a wake-up call for American companies. OpenAI’s CEO Sam Altman seemed to be a little more calm in his response. He took to X and said that it was quite “invigorating” to have new competitors in the market. He also applauded the company for delivering that kind of service for such a low cost and in the end, promised to speed up some of OpenAI’s own releases. It might seem that DeepSeek is the next big thing. And it might be so, considering that it has already become the No.1 downloaded free app on Apple’s app store. Its open-source model makes its codes and technical details open to all. This might also speed up progress through collaboration. But there are some hurdles in the way. For instance, so far the tool censors all topics that are not favored by the Chinese government. However, the question is how viable this approach will be if it tries to make it big in the global market. Plus, China is not on good terms with many of its neighbors. We have all seen how it went down for TikTok. So in this environment, will DeepSeek manage to survive or will it sink after this banging launch?
