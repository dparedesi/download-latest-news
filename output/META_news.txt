Good morning from a wet and gloomy London. It's been a real pleasure writing to you each day, but I'm delighted to say your usual host, Dan DeFrancesco, returns from parental leave next week. Not to worry, this isn't quite goodbye. I'll be back in your inbox on Labor Day, and I'll continue working behind the scenes on this newsletter. Oh, and do keep in touch — whether it's feedback, questions, or recommendations for a decent pint in London. I'm at your service. Now, on to today's big story: BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports on Meta's race against time to launch one of its latest products. What's on deck: Markets: The brands Morgan Stanley's summer interns are splurging on. Tech: Here's who stands to benefit — and who might suffer — from the AI software shakeout. Business: Dollar General is racing to grow its one hour delivery service. But first, the clock is ticking. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Meta is in a race against time. And there's not long left on the clock. Meta's Superintelligence Labs is under pressure to release one of its first projects by year-end, according to insiders who spoke with BI. This team has been one to watch. Assembled with urgency, Mark Zuckerberg spared no expense, cherry-picking the very best talent. In June, Meta spent a staggering $14 billion to acquire nearly half of Scale AI — then promptly put its 28-year-old cofounder in charge of the Superintelligence push. That's just the tip of the iceberg. Meta has reportedly dangled compensation packages worth hundreds of millions to lure elite researchers from companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind. But that strategy has rubbed some Meta employees the wrong way. As one former Meta researcher said, watching outsiders walk in with 10 to 50 times the compensation made some longtime staff feel like failures. Unsurprisingly, tensions are flaring. Some workers are threatening to jump ship to rivals. Others say they will quit on the spot to try to force Meta into negotiations. And so, less than two months after its launch, the cracks are beginning to show in Meta's Superintelligence Labs. At least eight employees have already left — including some who'd barely unpacked. Two OpenAI engineers reportedly lasted less than a month. We've seen the superstar hires. We've seen the eye-watering price tags. What we haven't seen? Results. When Meta rolled out its Llama 4 AI models in April, the crowd went mild. Developers felt it underdelivered in key areas like coding, reasoning, and following instructions. Now, BI's Jyoti Mann exclusively reports that the team is scrambling to fix the bugs, revive the product, and ship the next-gen release: Llama 4.X. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Meghan Morris, bureau chief, in Singapore. Akin Oyedele, deputy editor, in New York. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York.

Title: Strengthening the sustainability of neglected tropical disease programs in Rwanda: An assessment of access and utilization of domestically-financed services for soil-transmitted helminthiases and schistosomiasis
URL: https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371

Full Content:
Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH) infections remain some of the most prevalent neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), causing significant morbidity in most of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), including Rwanda. With dwindling international funding for NTD services and recent commitments focused on other diseases considered easier to eliminate as a public health problem, it is essential to assess domestic financing sources’ scale, efficiency, and effectiveness. The study aims to strengthen domestic efforts towards sustainable financing for neglected tropical disease programs in Africa, particularly in Rwanda. Up to 235 patients from 24 health centers in four districts of Rwanda were sampled for this survey. The districts selected had the highest number of STH and SCH based on routine data from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. We estimated affordability using the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW) and then compared this with household income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. Data was collected from August to September 2023. Limited secondary data were collected to complement primary data. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to present the findings. The most available drugs were mebendazole, with 100% of facilities reporting no stockout. Praziquantel (PZQ) was the most unavailable drug, reporting 92% stockout at the time of the survey, mainly due to delays in getting supplies from MDA-implementing health facilities. Diagnostics for SCH are the most inaccessible lab services. On average, the total cost (both direct and opportunity cost) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was USD 0.72 (RWF 861.92) and USD 0.96 (RWF 1136.41) for male and female patients, respectively. Although the assessment revealed that treatment for STH and SCH was affordable for the LPGW, women pay a 33% higher cost than men to access NTD services. While services are generally satisfactory, the reimbursement processes are slow, hindering timely access and utilization of SCH and STH services at the health facilities in Rwanda. While the access and utilization of STH and SCH services in health centers are generally promising, the findings underscore the potential for improvement. By addressing the efficiency in the supply of praziquantel drugs and enhancing reimbursement timelines, we can ensure the continuity and effectiveness of these services, offering hope for a brighter future in the fight against neglected tropical diseases. This study explores how Rwanda is working to sustainably finance healthcare services for two neglected tropical diseases—soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis (SCH)—as international aid for such diseases declines. The research surveyed 235 patients across 24 health centers in districts most affected by these conditions, focusing on how accessible, affordable, and well-utilized these services are under Rwanda’s domestic health financing mechanisms. Key findings show that while basic medications like mebendazole are widely available, others like praziquantel face frequent stockouts due to delayed reimbursements from the CBHI to clinics. Women experience longer travel and waiting times, resulting in higher opportunity costs than men. Yet, out-of-pocket expenses remain low—under USD 1 per visit—suggesting minimal financial risk to patients across income brackets. Patients rated the quality and acceptability of services highly, though most facilities lacked NTD treatment protocols. The study underscores how domestic efforts—such as budget allocations and health insurance coverage—have helped improve access. However, it stresses the need to streamline reimbursement processes and strengthen supply chains to avoid disruptions in drug availability. The findings provide valuable insight for policymakers aiming to reduce dependency on external funding while enhancing equitable access to NTD care.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Health systems across sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) pose significant barriers to the population’s access to health services. There are infrastructural gaps, particularly in rural areas, which experience geographical barriers to health facilities, poor medical supplies, and weak digital health infrastructure [1]. Human resource shortages, urban-biased distribution, and governance challenges continue to pose essential access barriers [2]. Apart from these, perhaps the most significant challenge remains financing, where many countries on the continent are far from meeting their health financing goals, e.g., less than seven countries met the Abuja target, and many countries’ out-of-pocket payments remain unacceptably high with low domestic spending and continued reliance on external resources [3]. With increasing anxiety over the long-term financing from external sources exemplified by the exit of USAID and sustainability challenges, one program area of concern is the financing of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). NTDs are diverse communicable yet preventable parasitic, viral, and bacterial diseases that affect over 1.0 billion of the world’s poorest and vulnerable populations primarily in tropical and sub‐tropical settings in Africa, Asia, and the Americas [4–6]. Up to 40% of the affected populations live in Africa, with the poorest and most vulnerable residing in hard-to-reach geographical areas [7–9]. Among the most prevalent NTDs, schistosomiasis (SCH) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH), or intestinal worms, remain a global public health concern and are highly prevalent in low and middle-income countries. They primarily affect poor communities with no access to potable water [10]. It is estimated that about 251.4 million people globally required preventive treatment for SCH in 2021, of which 93% of the total burden is found in sub-Saharan Africa [11]. Despite the existence of treatment and preventive measures, NTDs continue to be responsible for many years of life lost due to disability and premature death among the poor [12]. NTDs, therefore, constitute a disproportionate health burden to marginalized populations and exacerbate inequity. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 3) seek to close the health equity gap and have highlighted NTDs as necessary in achieving this objective. Improving access to NTD services is paramount to the SDGs agenda of reducing disease burden and improving health outcomes for all. Among children, NTDs contribute to disabilities and cognitive impairment, limiting their ability to progress with education and improve their living standards in adulthood [13]. Among adults, NTDs limit productivity and directly impact economic development [14]. Factors that exacerbate the NTD burden include poverty and marginalization, underfunding for health systems, and poor surveillance data [15,16]. The endemicity, the burden, and poor financing of NTDs in Africa are well documented [6,13,16–21]. Rwanda is considered one of the best-performing countries in Africa in its efforts to improve access to health services through public health insurance schemes and increased government spending on healthcare. For example, while Rwanda’s current health expenditure as a share of GDP stands at about 7.2%, its neighbours such as Kenya, Ethiopia, Uganda and Tanzania average 3% of GDP as of 2020 [22] However, the country remains endemic for two of the five NTDs amenable to preventive chemotherapy (PC) [23]. National prevalence of SCH ranged between 0% and 70% in areas surrounding water bodies in 2008, and the prevalence has declined significantly over the years, according to recent assessment reports [23,24]. In 2020, data yet to be published by the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC) showed that the threshold for elimination as a public health problem was reached in 97% of high-risk villages selected to assess the impact. In contrast, the national prevalence of STH infections stood at 41% as of 2020 [7,23,25]. However, the 2020 impact assessment found that adults remain the most infected compared to school-aged children, i.e., 48% versus 41%. In light of diminishing international support for NTD programs [26], and to maintain the gains in the fight against NTDs and increase service coverage for all, there is greater emphasis on domestic financing for sustainability. Currently, financing STH, SCH, and other related NTDs in Rwanda heavily depends on external sources. From the approved budgets, the funding for STH and SCH was RWF 6,250.59 million (USD 6.16 million) in the financial year 2021/22 and RWF 9048.54 million (USD 8.46 million) in 2022/23. External sources accounted for almost 92% of overall STH and SCH spending RWF 14,032.71 (USD 13.47 million) in the FYs 2021/22 and 2022/23. However, the government contribution significantly increased from RWF 126.33 (USD 0.12) million in 2021/22 to RWF 1100.388 (USD 1.07) million in 2022/23. Despite the increase in government budget, external funding remains significant and could grossly affect NTD service delivery if abruptly cut. To reduce dependency on external funding for NTDs, the government aims to increase budget allocation to account for at least 40% of the NTD budget to ensure sustainability [27]. Alongside budget increases, the Rwandan Government has improved access to NTD services by rolling out bi-annual mass drug administration (MDA), ensuring that over 65 million treatments against intestinal worms and schistosomiasis were delivered to children aged 1–15 years since 2008 [28]. The government has taken further steps to improve access to NTD treatment and preventive services by progressively integrating NTDs into the national health insurance benefit package- the Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI) scheme. Rwanda’s CBHI scheme was initiated by the Rwandan Government in 2005 to spread the financial burden of medical costs and ensure that the poor and vulnerable households have access to essential health services without incurring a financial burden [29]. The government subsidizes the CBHI scheme at almost 50% of the total funding [29–31]. The benefits package includes comprehensive preventive and curative services and essential drugs at health centers and referral hospitals. Integrating NTDs into the routine health services delivery system is a crucial indicator for domestic financing and is considered a key step toward sustainable NTD programming in endemic countries [32]. While the efforts to eliminate NTDs through sustainable financing in Rwanda are commendable, there are empirical gaps on whether the current funding from domestic sources (government and public insurance) has improved NTD service availability, affordability, and optimized utilization by the population to contribute toward sustainable elimination. For instance, STH and SCH services are expected to be available and affordable to all those in need of the services, but the range of services covered, their availability, demand, and utilization, and who bears the cost burden in trying to access SCH and STH services, is not well-understood in Rwanda. The aim of this study is, therefore, to provide evidence on the implications of public financing of NTDs on service access. This will assist the government and the CBHI in improving domestic resource mobilization and allocation for effective and sustainable NTD elimination. A protocol was submitted to the Ethics and Scientific Review Committee of the Rwanda National Research Ethics Committee (RNEC) and the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC). Approval for the study was received from RNEC (RNEC-IRB 0001497 of I0RGOOO1100) on August 11, 2023—collaboration letter from the Rwanda Biomedical Centre (RBC), Ref. No M84/RBC/2023, provided a human subjects exemption for this research on 13 October 2023. The study relied mainly on primary survey data collected through exit interviews. Secondary data were collected to inform the NTD financing situation in Rwanda and to understand the government budget for operational costs related to mass drug administration (MDA). This study was conducted in 24 randomly selected health centers in four Rwanda districts: Gisagara, Rubavu, Burera, and Rutsiro. These are amongst the districts with the co-endemicity for STH and Schistosomiasis as reported in the Rwanda NTDs Strategic Plan 2019–2024 [24]. In addition, these districts had a high number of STH and SCH, all combined from June 2021 to December 2022, which is the window period of the study. All the selected health centers were providing STH and SCH services (deworming medications including albendazole, mebendazole, and praziquantel; diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (SCH) and STH or intestinal worms) covered by the CBHI scheme. The sample size was calculated using the SCH and STH facility visits data for 2022, which was estimated at 207,572 visits. Assuming each of the 24 facilities had an equal number of visits during the year 2022, each facility received about 8649 SCH and STH patients, which translates to about 24 visits per day in each facility. Aiming for a higher sample size, the study chose to interview 50% of the census sample, i.e., every second patient in each facility was interviewed, which gave a total sample size of 288 SCH and STH patients. 235 patients were accepted to participate in the study, with an acceptable response rate of about 82%. In addition, 24 facility in-charges from the 24 health facilities were interviewed to assess stock levels of SCH and STH drugs. A total of four data collectors were assigned responsibility for collecting data at each of the 24 facilities. Each two-person team split responsibility between collecting facility data of individual facilities and interviewing individual study participants to assess the availability, affordability, and utilization of STH and SCH services. Data collection was completed between August and September 2023. Exit interview participants were recruited from the 24 facilities among the target populations in need of STH and SCH services who came to a study site seeking these services. Individual participants were selected after they had received STH and SCH services at the respective facility. The research assistants explained the study to each potential participant, using an approved recruitment script, and all respondents were asked if they were willing to voluntarily participate in the study. All willing participants signed a consent form after acknowledging their understanding of the purpose of the study. Exit interviews were conducted with each eligible participant based on their willingness to participate. The information collected included demographic characteristics of the respondents (age, religion, membership in a health insurance scheme, marital status, individual income, household income, level of education, employment status), transport costs, amount paid for drugs, travel time to and from the facility, and waiting time. English and Kinyarwanda translations of the participant and facility questionnaires were loaded onto a mobile data collection application, KoBoCollect, which was used to record responses. In this study, we considered three key dimensions of access [33] which include: (i) availability of services (drugs and non-drug pharmaceuticals, physical accessibility including distance to facility and travel time, and availability of qualified staff (ii) affordability of services including cost of medicine, travel costs, cost of consultation incurred concerning tests/investigations, other indirect costs); (iii) acceptability of services such as social and cultural context (gender) affecting accessibility, and individual patient perceptions of quality of services. Accessibility was assessed using the WHO availability target of greater than or equal to 80%. Affordability was estimated based on the average monthly wage for the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW). From an economic costing perspective, affordability was also estimated using direct financial expenses and opportunity costs. Costs to STH and SCH patients are largely restricted to the charges for the transport costs incurred from home to the treatment site and opportunity costs. The out-of-pocket costs included round-trip transportation costs, which were assessed through the exit interviews, and the time required for obtaining treatment, which included the round-trip travel time to the facility, waiting time, and time for consultation until exit from the facility. The patient’s daily earnings give an estimate of the value of time spent at the health facility. Data were analyzed using STATA version 17. Simple descriptive statistics assessed the availability, affordability, and utilization/demand of the selected STH and SCH drugs and related services. An availability of 80% or higher was used as the benchmark for accessibility as per WHO guidelines [34]. The combined availability of commodities that were surveyed was calculated to provide the overall availability of that specific commodity at the facility. Stockout information was sought from all the selected STH and SCH commodities covered by the CBHI scheme, which were supposed to be available at that level of care, regardless of whether they were in or out of stock at the time of the survey. Stockout was calculated as the percentage of facilities that reported at least one stockout of the selected STH and SCH commodity over the measured period, with stockout days calculated as the average number of days stockouts of a commodity lasted per facility. To calculate affordability, the median price of the entire treatment course of a commodity was compared to the official salary of the lowest-paid government worker (LPGW), per day in 2023. If a commodity price exceeded one day’s wages, it would be considered unaffordable based on the World Bank’s international poverty line (IPL) of USD 2.15 per person per day. Accessibility was calculated using the availability and LPGW affordability measures. This resulted in a composite measure in which accessibility is achieved with an 80% or higher availability and a price of less than a day’s wage for an LPGW. The results were then compared with information on income and expenditure obtained from patients participating in the survey. The results, presented in Table 1, revealed that the respondents tended to be young, with 39.2% under 30 years old. About the same number of respondents were single and never married (28%) or were living together (28.1%). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t001 As depicted in Fig 1, almost all the patients (99%) received consultation services, 29.8% received SCH diagnostic services, and 85% received STH diagnostics. A third of the respondents (33%) received the prescribed albendazole medicine, and 66.8% and 12.8% received the prescribed mebendazole and praziquantel medicines. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g001 Regarding stockouts of STH and SCH drugs on the day of the survey (Fig 2), 22 (92%) out of the 24 facilities did not have praziquantel drugs, and 11 (46%) had no diagnostics for STH or intestinal worms. In comparison, diagnostics for schistosomiasis were unavailable in 14 (58%) of the facilities. However, mebendazole drugs were available in all 24 health facilities. Note that, as the primary strategy for the NTD elimination programs, preventive chemotherapy (PC) employs anthelmintics, such as albendazole (ADZ) or mebendazole (MBDZ) for STHs, ADZ and diethylcarbamazine (DEC) and/or ivermectin (IVM) for LF and onchocerciasis, and praziquantel (PZQT) for SCH [35]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g002 The stockout of STH/SCH drugs forced patients to either use an alternative drug, e.g., mebendazole in place of albendazole, or to visit the facility another day when supplies were available. Alternatively, those who could afford it were advised by health workers to purchase at private facilities. As noted by the study, one of the major contributors to drug stockouts is a delay in receiving reimbursements for services provided. At the time of the survey, 23 out of the 24 facilities in the sample indicated that they experienced delays in receiving reimbursements from the CBHI through the Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB) for services provided during FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23. Table 2 presents the estimated number of months of delays in receiving the funds. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t002 About 75% of the facilities experienced 2–4 months of delays. The respondents cited several causes for the delays, including errors in preparing the invoice (37.5%), delays in submitting the invoice by the facilities (45.8%), delayed reimbursement from the CBHI scheme (79.2%), and delays in verifying the invoices (20.8%). The delayed reimbursement does not affect SCH and STH services alone, but the availability of all services is affected since health facilities cannot replenish their entire stocks before funds are made available. The study also considered the time taken to receive services (travel and waiting time) as a measure of availability in the timely use of NTD services. On average, women spent more time than men receiving NTD services (307.4 minutes or 5.0 hours for women compared to 238.5 minutes or 4.0 hours for men). In travel time, women spent about 95.93 minutes (approximately 2 hours) traveling to health facilities versus 78.94 minutes (approximately 1.3 hours) spent by men. Similarly, average time spent with the clinician, average waiting time, and average time after consultation to exit the facility were approximately 159.6 minutes (approximately 2.6 hours) for male patients and 211.5 minutes (3.5 hours) for female patients (Table 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t003 There was no immediate explanation for the differences between men and women in the time taken to receive services. However, less travel time and higher transport costs for men compared to women indicate that more men than women used motorbikes or other faster and more expensive means of transportation to the health facility. This suggests an economic advantage for men in accessing health facilities. A summary of patients’ indirect costs (cost of travel and waiting time), direct costs, and total costs for accessing STH and SCH treatment is presented in Table 4. The average total cost (including both direct and opportunity costs) to access and utilize STH and SCH services was US$0.72 (RWF 834.08) and US$0.96 (RWF 1,112.11) for male and female respondents, respectively. The average total cost for the opportunity costs accounted for 1.5% (US$0.45 or RWF 521.30) of the total average cost per day for male respondents. In comparison, the opportunity cost for female respondents accounted for 2.4% (US$0.68 or RWF 787.75) of the total cost per day. The out-of-pocket costs for transportation fares amounted to $0.09 (RWF 104.26) and $0.06 (RWF 69.51) for male and female respondents, respectively. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t004 The findings indicate that the average daily income was highest among male respondents at RWF1,784.01 (US$1.54) against RWF 1,702.92 (US$1.47) for females. The results show disparity in the costs for male and female respondents, which is largely driven by the amount of travel time and, hence, the cost per round trip. Table 5 presents the total average cost of time for the daily visits. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t005 The total cost to patients accessing STH and SCH services for a month was compared with the average monthly household income (Table 5). The results show that male patients paid direct costs of nearly US$0.28 (about 0.95% of average household income per month) for a month (assuming one visit to the health facility per month) to access treatment services at the facilities. The share of direct costs paid by female patients was US$0.28, which is about 0.99% of the average household income per month of US$28.30. The direct costs combined with indirect costs produced a total mean cost burden of US$0.72 or 3.4% of household income per month for male patients and a mean total cost per month of US$0.96 or 2.5% of average monthly household income for female patients (Fig 3). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.g003 The total direct and indirect costs as a share of household income are presented in Table 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t006 The results show that the poorest households spent about 3.3% of their income on STH and SCH care. On the other hand, those in the middle—and upper-income brackets spent between 1.7% and 2.5% of their income on STH and SCH care and treatment. The wealthiest households with an income of RWF 250,000 spent 4.7% on STH and SCH treatment and care. These findings, including on the expenditures of LPGW, show no real financial risk involving catastrophic payments for STH and SCH services. These findings show that the cost burden of SCH and STH services is progressive because of government subsidies that target low-income earners. Higher income brackets are also likely to spend more on faster means of transportation and also pay out of pocket during stockouts. Costs by district show Rubavu District is the most expensive for those seeking SCH and STH services. Women incur the highest cost averaging about USD 1.37 against men who incur USD 0.83 per trip (Table 7). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t007 In addition to cost, the quality of services is an important determinant of using STH and SCH services. In this study, respondents were asked to record their level of satisfaction concerning: (i) quality of treatment received, ii) privacy and confidentiality, iii) timeliness in the provision of services, (iv) facility cleanliness and hygiene, (v) attitude towards patients, (vi) overall rating. A rating scale (excellent, good, fair, and poor) was used. Most respondents (78.3%) rated the services provided as good, while 17.5% rated them as fair and 1.7% rated the services as poor. Other aspects of acceptability (e.g., cleanliness and hygiene, privacy of treatment and waiting time, and staff attitude) were similar, indicating that an overwhelming majority of the respondents viewed the services as acceptable (Table 8). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t008 In addition, the study assessed the availability of treatment protocols as a measure of improved patient-centered outcomes. The survey results revealed that 21 (88%) of the facilities did not have NTD treatment protocols for various NTDs, and only three facilities reported availability of treatment protocols for NTDs. The utilization of STH and SCH services decreased slightly from 215,267 OPD visits in 2021–207,572 OPD visits in 2022 (Table 9). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t009 The data show that most STH and SCH patients were treated asymptomatically. Patients receiving intestinal worm medications (mebendazole or albendazole) accounted for 82.3% of the total outpatient (OPD) visits over the two years. In contrast, diagnostics accounted for 17.3% of the visits for STH and 4% for SCH. In terms of utilization by district, the health facilities in Burera district accounted for 29.1% and 29.7%, respectively, of the total utilization of STH and SCH services, followed by Rubavu, which accounted for 26.7% and 26.2% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Facilities in the Gisagara district reported the lowest utilization, at 17.7% in 2021 and 18.8% in 2022 (Table 10). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0012371.t010 The number of OPD visits for all STH and SCH services during the two years declined slightly, except for intestinal worm medication. The largest drop in outpatient utilization (OPD) was observed in the diagnostics for Schistosomiasis (from 1732 OPD visits in 2021–136 OPD visits in 2022), followed by patients for deworming medications (mebendazole), whose utilization declined from 79,233 in 2021–70,826. There are concerns about access and sustainability of health services in general and NTD programs in particular due to overreliance on external funding and low domestic investments. Sustainability means the capacity of a health system to maintain the gains toward NTD prevention and control on the path to elimination. Poor access to NTD services has broader policy implications beyond the health system. It imposes an economic burden by reducing productivity and contributes to a cycle of poverty and social exclusion [36]. Late-stage presentations of most NTDs are not just fatal but are a significant burden to health facilities and jeopardize progress toward Universal Health Coverage. The United Nations SDGs recognize universal access to NTD services as integral to achieving UHC [37]. On the other hand, children afflicted with NTDs have lower educational achievement as NTDs increase absenteeism and cognitive impairment, therefore potentially contributing to lower social status [13,38]. As a largely neglected program in many low- and middle-income countries, countries are encouraged to invest domestic resources to control and eliminate NTDs. In Rwanda, the bulk (90%) of funding for STH and SCH prevention and elimination is external. However, the Rwanda Government has progressively relied less on external support to control and eliminate NTDs. The steps include (i) the introduction of a budget line for procurement of NTD drugs, (ii) the design and delivery of a package of NTD care under the CBHI scheme, (iii) the adoption of one health policy that commits to enhance collaboration of different actors of NTD stakeholders, (iv) budget allocation for MDA operational costs, and (v) decentralization of NTD interventions and integration of NTD prevention efforts to the village level under district coordination. The study focused on understanding how public domestic financing through the Rwandan government’s introduction of a budget line for NTD drugs and financing under the CBHI scheme has influenced access to and utilization of SCH and STH services in Rwanda. The introduction of a budget vote influences access to healthcare by guaranteeing a resource basket, affecting the funding available for health services [39]. In so doing, it contributes to financial risk protection by lowering the cost of care for individuals. There is a growing body of literature on NTD service access (availability, affordability, and utilization) with mixed results [16,40–42]; e.g., in Ethiopia, Kassahun et al. [40] showed that service availability is relatively good with up to 64% of all health facilities offering STH services, but only 40% had SCH services. Our findings show a similar trajectory of inconsistency in the availability of SCH and STH drugs; e.g., praziquantel is the least available medicine with a stockout rate of 92% because of delays in receiving supplies from MDA implementing health facilities. This is followed by albendazole, received by just 33% of patients seeking care. On the other hand, mebendazole was the most available drug with 100% facilities stocked. In other NTDs, Ooms et al. [41] report low availability of snakebite commodities (43%) in public health facilities. Similarly, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute [43] found that the availability of drugs for NTD treatment varied by facility type, with hospitals more likely than lower-level facilities to be stocked. One of the most cited causes of stockouts of essential drugs is delayed reimbursements to health facilities to allow for timely re-stocking of commodities [44,45]. The consequences of a lack of availability of essential NTD services are not only costly to those seeking care but also discourage repeat visits, which constitutes a barrier to NTD control and elimination. The reimbursements to facilities need to be predictable and the supply chain strengthened, to ensure consistency in the availability of critical NTD services, particularly those prepaid through publicly financed institutions. The availability of SCH and STH services is hampered by distance to health facilities, with women disproportionately affected. Of the 85% of the respondents who walked to a health facility, women spent on average 96 minutes compared to 79 minutes spent by men. The extra time spent by women traveling to health facilities not only has cost implications but also constitutes a physical barrier to accessing NTD services. Although the government took steps to reduce walking time to facilities by 50% (from 95 minutes to 47 minutes) in 2020 [46], the evidence suggests that there are still significant challenges in accessing health facilities in some districts. The steps taken by the government include the construction of health posts and the deployment of community health workers to bring services closer to communities [46]. The use of CHWs to bring NTD services closer to the communities has been proven effective in malaria control and improving maternal and child health services [47,48]. It is highly recommended for effective and sustainable control and elimination of NTDs. What remains encouraging in Rwanda is that SCH and STH services remain essentially affordable with no evidence of catastrophic expenses. Usually, out-of-pocket health expenditure is considered catastrophic and impoverishing when a household is forced to cut down on subsistence needs, sell productive assets, incur debts, or utilize savings to meet health needs [34,41,49,50]. Similar to this study, Dong et. al. [51] reported better affordability overall but also noted a large gap between the affordability levels of originator brands (OBs) and lowest-priced generics (LPGs) of essential drugs in Ethiopia. The affordability of SCH and STH services in Rwanda was primarily influenced by travel and waiting time, whose costs were higher than the expenses for the actual NTD services at health facilities. Noting that the indirect medical expenses disproportionately affected women calls for considering the driving factors in the analysis of access to NTD services in a low-resource setting, such as Rwanda. Women spent about a dollar more than men to access health facilities- a cost mainly attributed to more extended travel and waiting time, which are likely to be an important determinant of STH and SCH services utilization. Saxena et al. [52] have reported cost-related disparities between men and women in access to healthcare. Affordability is a critical determinant of access to health services in most settings, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Generally, essential health services are found to be relatively unaffordable to many people [16,42,49,53–55]. However, treatment costs for STH and SCH services are affordable in a low-income setting, requiring only 13% of a day’s wages from the LPGW. This suggests that NTD control and prevention is one of the best buys in public health available to those affected community members. Studies such as Ooms et. al. [40] have also demonstrated the affordability of NTD services, excluding snake anti-venoms, which are found to be unaffordable to most households in Kenya. Governments should, therefore, be encouraged to invest more in NTD control and elimination as a less costly alternative to the continued neglect of NTDs. Rwanda currently funds operational costs of MDAs, which indicates that significant costs can be domestically resourced when appropriately prioritized through political commitment, effective advocacy, governance, multisectoral coordination structures, and integration within the broader health system budgeting and planning processes. Evidence of steady demand and utilization of STH and SCH services in Rwanda indicates efficiency in the use of investments in NTDs, wherein the target population utilizes the services purchased; i.e., the population’s NTD needs are well aligned with the services purchased. There is also a clear linkage between service use and the reported high patient satisfaction with the services offered. However, the demand and utilization can still be improved with timely reimbursements to health facilities and a strengthened procurement and supply chain for NTD commodities. Satisfaction with health services is a contentious issue, especially in LMIC, with many reporting poor services associated mainly with poor staff attitude, ineffective physician consultations, and inefficient admission process [52,53]. However, in Ghana, there was an overwhelming majority (>95%) of patients who had a positive perception of the quality of services [19]. Our study reported 95.3% satisfaction with SCH and STH services, which means that, although the quality of services is generally low in low-resource settings, there is evidence from both the Ghanaian and Rwandan experiences that this can change for the better. The WHO emphasizes that the goals of UHC cannot be effectively achieved if the quality of services is not satisfactory. The surest way to sustain and eliminate neglected diseases is to combine adequate domestic financing with improved access to and utilization of quality NTD services. This combination needs to be approached from an equity lens, considering the identified gender gaps in access to SCH and STH services. The study is aware of biases related to self-reported data and ensured that the data collected from individual participants were triangulated with discussions with health workers. Micro-level gaps, such as socioeconomic indicators and behavioral determinants of health, were either not relevant to the objective of the study or addressed by having well-trained interviewers to ensure data consistency. The generalizability concerns have been addressed through triangulated data sources and a non-biased sampling process of 24 primary health facilities in different districts representing urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. However, the study acknowledges that the small sample size focusing on primary health facilities may limit generalization in hospital settings. We sincerely appreciate all the respondents who took the time to participate in the survey. We are also grateful to the senior staff at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) and the Ministry of Health for their kind support during the entire data collection period. We also thank the facility in-charges for their cooperation during this study.

Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: A New Vision For Money: Hoskinson Predicts Bitcoin Will Hit $10 Trillion

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Charles Hoskinson, a founder of Ethereum and the driving force behind Cardano, laid out a sweeping forecast for crypto markets and payments this week. He predicted Bitcoin could reach $250,000 in the current market cycle and said the token’s total market value might hit $10 trillion in the next five years. Reports have disclosed that he links that outlook to new US stablecoin rules and what he calls clearer market structure. In an interview on the David Lin Report, Hoskinson argued that Bitcoin’s design made it strong as a store of value but limited as a global payments rail. He pointed to the old “big block” debates that pushed the network toward saving rather than everyday payments. Layer Two solutions, he said, are where Bitcoin gains the speed and lower cost needed for daily use. This framing leaves room for other blockchains to offer broader financial services. Hoskinson framed Cardano as an alternative path — one built on research and formal methods rather than rapid experimentation. Based on reports, the network has operated continuously for about eight years and uses a proof-of-stake model that many users back. Reports also state that over 70% of ADA in circulation has been staked by holders who support the network. That figure is commonly cited when comparing Cardano’s staking take-up to other blockchains. Stablecoins are central to Hoskinson’s case. He told lawmakers and audiences that tokens tied to fiat could give people in countries with weak local currencies access to dollar-like stability. According to White House materials, the GENIUS Act has moved through the political process and was signed into law by US President Donald Trump, creating a new US framework for stablecoins. Based on data, the stablecoin market has topped $250 billion in supply, a milestone that regulators and banks are watching closely. Hoskinson was blunt about exchanges and the stock market. He called current exchange practices “preposterous” and criticized systems that rely on centralized trust, including large listing fees and gatekeeping by a few firms. He said decentralized exchanges — where the protocol enforces rules — could cut out those middlemen and give people more control over their assets. That pitch fits a wider industry argument for moving custody and trade settlement onto public blockchains. For Hoskinson, Bitcoin will stay digital gold, while stablecoins, tokenized assets, and decentralized systems grow around it. The real question, he suggests, is not only how high Bitcoin’s price can go, but how the movement of money will be reshaped.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

What am I humming? Bubble Pop by HyunA, for no particular reason. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Nvidia has been on a tear. Just in case you've been living under a nice mossy rock the past few years, the advent of generative AI has ushered in a golden era for the company. Let's talk some truly eye-watering facts and figures: during Nvidia's Q2 2025 earnings call, the company reported a total revenue of $46.7 billion. Okay, so it's more like a diamond-encrusted-with-foie-gras-on-the-side era, but it's been far from smooth sailing. As such, with the next-gen Rubin architecture just off the horizon and data centre demand continuing to grow, Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said during the aforementioned earnings call, "We advise our partners, our customers to pace themselves." It's bizarre to hear the head of a company making bank say anything to the effect of 'actually, hold your horses,' but Huang advises that Nvidia's AI customers build "data centers on an annual rhythm." Why? There are more than a few potential reasons, ranging from the ever-changing tariff situation in the US, to potential strain on what may well be an AI bubble. But, specifically referring to Nvidia's H100 and H200 GPU clusters often used in AI data centres, Huang had this to say: "Right now, the buzz is — I'm sure all of you know about the buzz out there. The buzz is everything sold out." We've also seen stock supply issues on the gaming side. Early supplies of RTX 50-series GPU stock left much to be desired, making it an absolute mission to find a card at MSRP only a few months ago. Still, gaming alone raked in $4.3 billion for Nvidia, according to the Q2 2025 earnings call. Thankfully, it's a little easier to find a 50-series card at a reasonable price now, as our best graphics cards deals guide can attest. However, it's worth noting that Nvidia's AI revenue vastly overshadows even the billions made by its gaming division. As such, Huang kept these priorities in sight as he reassured investors that Nvidia was taking steps to avoid similar scarcity with Rubin later this year. In his closing remarks, Huang said, "Our next platform, Rubin, is already in fab. We have six new chips that represent the Rubin platform. They have all ticked up at TSMC. Rubin will be our third-generation NVLink rack scale AI supercomputer, and so we expect to have a much more mature and fully scaled up supply chain." Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. Given the constantly shifting US tariff situation and its far-reaching effects on the wider geopolitical stage, it's hard to comment on the projected success of even the best laid plans. And then there's the fact that major player Meta is actually looking to downsize its own AI division—could this herald the shape of things to come for AI's place within big tech? If Huang suspects as much, he didn't let on, instead saying, "Blackwell and Rubin AI factory platforms will be scaling into the $3 trillion to $4 trillion global AI factory build out through the end of the decade." 👉Check out our full guide👈 1.

Title: Concerns Grow As Strategy Issues More Stocks To Buy Bitcoin

Strategy’s latest stock sale to buy more Bitcoin has put investor nerves on edge, as numbers and timing raise fresh doubts about shareholder dilution and the company’s funding choices. Based on reports, Strategy changed its public guidance on August 18 and then, within days, moved to issue a large amount of new stock. CryptoQuant analyst JA Maartunn traced the pattern: no fresh issuance on Aug. 3, roughly $18 million on Aug. 10, about $51 million on Aug. 17 — then close to $360 million raised in a single week after the guidance change. That sharp jump in new capital has drawn scrutiny from market watchers who worry the company is leaning on share issuance to keep buying Bitcoin. The new rules link stock sales to something called market net asset value, or mNAV, which compares the company’s share price to the value of its Bitcoin. Strategy running out of steam? 🚂💨 Before Aug 18, almost no new money came into $MSTR: 🔹 Aug 3: $0 🔹 Aug 10: ~$18M 🔹 Aug 17: ~$51M But after they dropped the “no dilution below 2.5x mNAV” promise, $359M was raised by issuing new shares (see tweet below). Policy changed.… https://t.co/nenuT1soI3 pic.twitter.com/pORoidxPhf — Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) August 26, 2025 If the stock trades at more than four times its mNAV, the company will sell lots of shares to buy more Bitcoin. If it trades between 2.5 and four times, it will sell some shares, but more carefully. And if the stock drops below 2.5 times, share sales would mostly go toward paying debt or covering dividends instead of buying Bitcoin. Reports add that if Strategy shares trade under 1x mNAV, the company could borrow to repurchase stock. That framework reversed an earlier pledge not to sell shares for Bitcoin purchases when mNAV was below 2.5x — a reversal that critics point to as the key change. According to the company’s SEC filing, nearly $310 million came from at-the-market common stock sales at an average share price of $354, plus roughly $47 million from preferred share classes. In total, the firm raised a little more than $357 million and used the proceeds to buy 3,081 Bitcoin. The purchase pushed its holdings to 632,457 BTC. That stack of 632,457 coins equals roughly 3% of circulating supply, based on market counts cited in filings and market reports. The company’s public target remains at 1 million coins — a goal that, by the reported figures, is now about 60% complete. Investors focused on dilution have reason to be worried. Each new share increases the number of claims on the same Bitcoin pool, and when issuance happens while the stock trades at low multiples to mNAV, existing holders see their per-share Bitcoin backing decline. Reports say Strategy’s debt sits at about 20% of Bitcoin NAV with headroom up to 30%, giving it borrowing room — but choosing to issue equity at low mNAVs still weakens per-share economics.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote.

Title: Media & Marketing Financials – August 2025

by Mathew Broughton on 28th Aug 2025 in News With Autumn and ATS London on the horizon, ExchangeWire research lead Mat Broughton takes stock (if you'll pardon the pun) of company financials across the media and marketing ecosystem. A solid quarter overall for our monitored advertising technology companies, however subsequent volatility suggests headwinds for the remainder of the year. As we track to the start of the calendar month, the chart above does not account for the post-results hit to The Trade Desk, which took a near 40% thumping in terms of its share price off of a deceleration in growth. Despite reaping recent rewards with its continued championing of the open web, investors panicked over competition from the likes of Amazon. As summarised by Madison & Wall, “Long-term optimism around the opportunity from the open web for The Trade Desk continues to seem unfounded to us[...] As well uncertainties abound around the mix of revenue trends for the company from data vs. technology fees.” Ouch. This had a knock-on effect on the rest of the sector, with Zeta, MNTN, Magnite, PubMatic and Viant, all seeing share price dips despite solid earnings. Simultaneously, we saw AppLovin continue its meteoric rise, despite ongoing scrutiny as to its practices. If The Trade Desk gets thumped for calling Amazon a potential partner, why does AppLovin avoid the hammer for wholly partnering with Meta whilst simultaneously acting as a parasite? This is all not to forget the latest flop in the flip-flop-flip-flop saga of Google deprecating third-party cookies across its Chrome browser, now deciding that users will no longer be offered the choice to use, or not use, the cookie. Where one door of uncertainty closes, another opens… The big tech and social platforms recorded astounding revenue growth across the board, particularly considering the age of some of these firms. Notably, Meta, Reddit, and Apple all exceeded earnings expectations despite Trump's tariffs and economic slowdown. Twas much of the same for Google parent Alphabet, as its third-party network business continues to stagnate, whilst YouTube goes gangbusters, achieving double-digit growth to reach USD$9.8bn (£7.2bn). Search revenue also continues to climb, bouldering 12% upwards to over USD$54bn (£39.9bn). Google claims that its AI search results monetise at the same rate as traditional search ads, despite these decimating publisher traffic, indicating these generate far fewer clicks, and comparatively showing far fewer ads within its AI Mode. I asked Google AI Mode to clarify:Righto. A highly tumultuous time across the agency landscape, with the public-listed holding groups exposed to the joint gales of AI and upstart independents. In recent months, we’ve seen a frankly aggressive period of client switching, with massive brand accounts switching hands nigh-on every week. Through this turbulence, Omnicom and IPG had a stable quarter ahead of the closure of their blockbuster merger. Further consolidation was seemingly on the cards, with Sir Martin Sorrell’s S4Capital mulling over a merger approach from private equity-backed MSQ Partners, only for the mooted acquirer to come out and say that they had not made an approach, nor would ever do so ever again. Savagery Publicis continues to fly, nabbing accounts aplenty at the expense of its rivals. I’ve used the phrase “mastering the narrative” a lot in recent months regarding Publicis, and they continue to do so, rightfully highlighting that scrutiny will shift onto Omnicom/IPG following the completion of their merger (much to the delight of beleaguered WPP). As industry expert Barry Dudley observed: "having an enemy, a Goliath to your David, is very commonly what drives people, drives businesses. This has been the environment that Publicis has been playing within." A mixed bag among the publisher set, with digital publishers and streaming providers seeing strong gains, whilst traditional linear TV publishers continue to face headwinds. Despite market challenges, UK publishers showed strong momentum, whilst audience targeting, first-party data strategies, and AI integration, all dominated earnings presentations. Consolidation has cooled in the segment, barring the merger between Nextar and Tegna, which seeks to solidify shaky foundations beneath the house of local TV across the US. Despite rampant speculation earlier in the year, gossip has quietened about a potential divestment of ITV Studios from the parent ITV business, however talks may still be ongoing on that front.

Title: Investors are looking at bargains in China, says HSBC investment boss, pushed by AI discounts and fears over Trump 2.0

Eleanor Pringle is an award-winning reporter at Fortune covering news, the economy, and personal finance. Eleanor previously worked as a business correspondent and news editor in regional news in the U.K. She completed her journalism training with the Press Association after earning a degree from the University of East Anglia. When President Trump returned to the White House his intention was clear: to make America great again. But the United States’ economic partners, and some of its rivals, are also benefiting from having the unorthodox showman back in the Oval Office. Investors are watching the U.S. stock market with both enthusiasm and trepidation: The S&P 500 is up 15% over the past year, Treasuries have remained relatively steady, and the Fed’s monetary policy is expected to begin a downward trajectory. But overlaying the strong fundamentals are questions: Is the soaring growth of Magnificent Seven stocks overvalued on the unfulfilled promises of AI? Will Trump’s unusual foreign policy materially damage the domestic economy? And where might the true winners of the artificial intelligence race emerge from? Increasingly, investors are answering those questions by diversifying into a key region, says Willem Sels, global chief investment officer for HSBC’s global private bank. That region is China. America continues to prove its economic resilience and earnings deliverables, Sels told Fortune in an exclusive interview, but geopolitical uncertainty is pushing investors toward balancing risk with other regions. Traditionally, the question of political influence over portfolios has centered on emerging markets, said Sels, but over the past few years that has moved into developed markets as well. As such, diversification has become more of a focus—particularly for business owners looking to spread risk between the economy they operate in and the assets used to protect their wealth. “When a client comes in the door … the first discussion is, ‘Please build a global portfolio. Maybe try to have as little as possible in your home country if you already have your business here, because that’s diversification,’” Sels said. “Clearly the debate over the last few months was about, Will there be diversification away from the U.S.? And there are a number of elements to that.” Part of the question is how dominant U.S. Big Tech has become in equity markets, with the Magnificent Seven stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla) providing most of the growth. As such, if these stocks hiccup it can have major ramifications for portfolios. “Clearly you potentially need to do something around that … to diversify,” Sels said. “We highlight things like, make sure that you don’t only have the growth stocks but have some value stocks, do some sector diversification, do some geographical diversification, and so on. “The other thing that triggered that diversification discussion obviously was the rapid policy changes in the U.S., and the growth of the debt pile, which led people to ask the question, ‘Is there a de-dollarization story? And what does that mean in terms of my portfolio and other people’s portfolio?’ What we’ve seen in the data is that there have been two months or so where there were some outflows out of bonds and equity markets, but that has not lasted—to a large extent because policy has become a little bit clearer.” “People are adding a little bit to other regions, adding a little bit to other sectors to be less concentrated in the U.S. market, but they are not fleeing away from it,” Sels continued. “There was enthusiasm for European stocks, but it was very short-lived. The Asian investors, over the last 15 [to] 20 years that I’ve been going there, find it very hard to get excited about Europe.” Part of the problem is that these investors don’t see as many new or emerging companies that could materially change the European economy, and there’s also the issue of brand recognition beyond companies like LVMH and BMW, Sels said. “This is the first time that we’re again seeing flows from Europe into China,” Sels added. “That is to a large extent because of the AI trade that people want to play, and then secondly this concept of anti-involution … with the supply-side reforms which would address the issue of overcapacity, therefore the deflation issue and therefore the earnings growth, because what you have in China is a lot of very competitive companies … therefore they have no pressing power, and therefore earnings growth has been reasonably weak.” China has signaled a shift in priorities to address involution, with the country’s Central Finance and Economic Affairs Commission telling President Xi Jinping in a meeting last month that Beijing must “focus on key and difficult issues, regulate enterprises’ disorderly and low-price competition,” and “guide enterprises to improve product quality and promote the orderly exit of outdated production capacity.” Beijing is no stranger to the issue. In 2015 the government launched similar actions to address overcapacity, particularly in key regions like steel and coal, in order to boost corporate profitability. Flash-forward to 2025 and “they’re now addressing that,” Sels said. “Therefore we think that earnings expectations will go up … One of the main obstacles for our clients had been the belief that [Chinese companies are] over-competing, and therefore your earnings are not there, the economic growth is potentially there, but your earnings are not there. “That’s now changing. So we’re seeing flows back and obviously also encouraged by ‘How can I diversify my big U.S. trunk of assets?’” With discussions about diversification out of the U.S. remaining active, China seems to have emerged as the region to balance that risk, Sels said. And Beijing’s typically lower share prices also offer the category of the moment, AI, at a bargain. In a note published last week, HSBC said that within the AI ecosystem, infrastructure stocks are outperforming enablers and adopters—at 22.2% versus 11.3% and 13.5% since July. Indeed, this week Chinese chipmaker Cambricon Technologies briefly became the country’s most expensive stock, surging 10% on Wednesday to 1,465 yuan ($204.62). At the time of writing, the share price has dropped back but is up 112% for the year to date. And while Cambricon exemplifies the more expensive end of the scale, Sels highlights that other equivalents to U.S. stocks can be found at a “30% to 40% discount.” “We’re basically saying, ‘Listen, don’t just look at the chips makers but also look at the guys that build out the infrastructure around it. The guys that build out the energy, the electricity supply around it, the robotics and automation, where it is not just a matter of, we move the data a little bit—this is real, big innovation.’ And so by diversifying throughout the AI ecosystem, I think you address a little bit of the question about valuations.” China’s stock market is soaring: The SSE Composite Index is up 33.4% over the past year, while the S&P 500 is up 14.9%. While the growth in China is marked, HSBC’s research points out U.S. AI-related capital expenditure (driven by the “Big Four” of Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta, along with Stargate and other private companies) is surpassing that of China’s “Big Four” (Alibaba, ByteDance, Tencent, and Baidu, as well as telecom services companies) by eight- to 10-fold. Moreover, HSBC’s research adds: “U.S. firms achieve higher returns on AI capex, with cloud platforms generating significantly more revenue than their Chinese counterparts—close to USD $400 billion in the U.S. vs. USD $60 billion in China in 2024, according to Statista.” So while clients may be balancing against overreliance on American companies, Sels said, the upside fundamentals of the U.S. remain strong—enough to take recession off the table. Indeed, while blips in tech stocks recently led to questions over an AI bubble, the HSBC boss remained bullish: “We certainly think that that AI liftoff is structural in nature.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: Chip giant Nvidia’s sales rise 56% in boost for AI boom

US chipmaker reports revenue of $46.74bn for second quarter, defying fears that AI may be overhyped. By John Power Chip giant Nvidia has set a new sales record, a sign that demand for artificial intelligence remains strong despite fearsthe technology may be overhyped. Nvidia, the world’s most valuable company, on Wednesday reported revenue of $46.74bn for the three months that ended in July, a rise of 56 percent year-on-year. Profit for the quarter was $26.42bn, a yearly rise of 59 percent. Nvidia’s latest earnings report had been hotly anticipated as the tech giant is widely seen as a barometer of the AI boom, which has lifted the US stock market from all-time high to all-time high. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that production of Blackwell Ultra, Nvidia’s latest platform using its most advanced chips, was ramping up “at full speed” and demand for the company’s products was “extraordinary”. “The AI race is on, and Blackwell is the platform at its centre,” Jensen said. Looking ahead, the Santa Clara, California-based tech giant predicted revenue of $54bn, plus or minus 2 percent, for the July-September quarter, which would be slightly above market expectations. Despite the robust results, Nvidia’s stock price fell more than 3 percent in after-hours trading, an indication of the sky-high expectations attached to the chipmaker, which is valued at more than $4.4 trillion. Nvidia’s sales notably did not include any shipments to China, whose market is subject to US government export controls intended to blunt Beijing’s ability to develop AI. US President Donald Trump’s administration earlier this month lifted a ban on sales of Nvidia’s H20 chip, which was designed specifically for the Chinese market, following concerted lobbying by Huang. As part of its agreement with the Trump administration, Nvidia agreed to pay the US government 15 percent of revenues from chip sales in China. The lifting of the ban on the H20 raises the possibility that Nvidia could have potentially enormous untapped sales potential in the world’s second-largest economy, though its prospects have been complicated by a recent directive by Beijing urging local firms against doing business with the company. “Just imagine what will happen to this stock if the China business even comes half back to life,” The Kobeissi Letter, a newsletter following capital markets, said. “Jensen Huang will undoubtedly be working overtime on the China situation. The AI Revolution is in full swing.” Fuelled by explosive demand for its AI, Nvidia’s revenue has grown at breakneck speed over the past two years. The company posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024. Since the start of 2023, the price of Nvidia shares has multiplied more than 11 times over, with the stock up more than 30 percent so far this year. The firm’s stellar performance, underpinned by multibillion-dollar AI investments by tech giants including Microsoft, Meta and Amazon, has stoked discussion about whether AI could be in a bubble. In an interview with The Verge earlier this month, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who oversaw the release of the groundbreaking AI model ChatGPT, said he believed that investors were “overexcited” about the technology.

The S&P 500 achieved a record high close ahead of Nvidia's quarterly results, a key event testing the AI rally's valuation. While Nvidia's stock dipped slightly, its significant S&P 500 weighting makes its financial performance crucial. Investors are also monitoring potential interest rate cuts and political developments, including Trump's attempt to replace a Federal Reserve Governor. The S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 1 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 127 new highs and 35 new lows.

Title: World's most valuable company beats market expectations

Despite uncertainty about trade with China, Nvidia forecasts it will take in even more money than analysts expected in three months' time. Business and economics reporter @taaffems Thursday 28 August 2025 07:26, UK The world's most valuable company, and first to be valued at $4trn (£2.9trn), beat market expectations in keenly anticipated financial results. Microchip maker Nvidia recorded revenues of $46.7bn (£34.6bn) in just three months up to July, latest financial data from the company showed, slightly better than Wall Street observers had expected. The company's performance is seen as a bellwether for artificial intelligence (AI) demand, with investors paying close attention to see whether the hype is overblown or if significant investment will pay off. Originally a creator of gaming graphics hardware, Nvidia's chips help power AI capability - and the UK's most powerful supercomputer. Nvidia's graphics processors underpin products such as ChatGPT from OpenAI and Gemini from Google. Other tech giants - Microsoft, Meta and Amazon - make up Nvidia's biggest customers and are paying large sums to embed AI into their products. Why does it matter? Nvidia has been central to the boom in AI development and the surge in tech stock valuations, which has seen stock markets reach record highs. It represents about 8% of the value of the US S&P 500 stock market index of companies relied on to be stable and profitable. Strong results will continue to fuel record highs in the market. Conversely, results that fail to live up to the hype could trigger a market tumble. Read more business news:Government costs to push up energy price capWagamama owner among suitors for Costa Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Nvidia itself saw its share price rise more than 40% over the past year. Its value impacts anyone with cash in the US stock market, such as pension funds. The S&P 500 rose 14% over the past year, and the tech-company-heavy NASDAQ gained 21%, largely thanks to Nvidia. As such, its earnings can move markets as much as major economic or monetary policy announcements, like an interest rate decision. What next? Revenue rises are forecast to continue to rise as Nvidia said it expected a rise to roughly $54bn (£40bn) in the next three months, more than the $53.14bn (£39.3bn) anticipated by analysts. This excludes any potential shipments to China as export of Nvidia's H20 chip, designed with the Biden administration's export crackdown on advanced AI powering chips in mind, had been banned under US national security grounds. But in recent weeks, Nvidia and another chipmaker, AMD, reached an unprecedented agreement to pay the Trump administration a 15% portion of China sales in return for export licences to send chips to China. There were no H20 sales at all to China in the second quarter of the year, the period for which results were released on Wednesday evening. Previously, 13% of Nvidia's revenue came from China, with nearly 50% coming from the US. Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free Market reaction Despite the expectation-beating results, Nvidia shares were down by up to 3% in after-hours trading, as the massive revenue rises previously booked by the company were not repeated in the latest quarter, fuelling fears of a more persistent slowdown in growth ahead. Compared to a year ago, revenues rose 56% and 6% compared to the three months up to April. The absence of Chinese sales in forecasts appeared to disappoint. But Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: "Smart investors will look through the noise. Nvidia has traded flat or down after results in four of the past five quarters, only to do all the heavy lifting after markets have had time to digest the results. "The law of large numbers seems irrelevant here - despite its scale, Nvidia continues to defy expectations as consensus underestimates the opportunity at hand. Third-quarter revenue guidance at $54bn is a strong number, especially when it factors in no benefit from Chinese sales."

Title: AI Bubble 2027
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-bubble-2027/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T14:37:21Z
Full Content:
Soundtrack: The Dillinger Escape Plan - One Of Us Is The Killer An MIT study found that 95% of organizations are getting "zero return" from generative AI, seemingly every major outlet is now writing an "are we in a bubble?" story, and now Meta has frozen AI hiring. Things are looking bleak for the AI bubble, and people are getting excited that this loathsome, wasteful era might be coming to an end. As a result, I'm being asked multiple times a day when the bubble might burst. I admit I'm hesitant to make any direct timelines — we are in a time (to quote former Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan) of irrational exuberance, where the markets have oriented themselves around something very silly and very, very expensive. Regardless, Anthropic is apparently raising as much as $10 billion in its next funding round, and OpenAI allegedly hit $1 billion in revenue in July, which brings it in line with my estimate that it’s made about $5.26 billion in revenue in 2025 so far, The bubble "bursting" is not Sam Altman declaring that we're in a bubble — it's a series of events that lead to big tech pulling away from this movement, investment money drying up, and the current slate of AI companies withering and dying because they can't raise more money, can't go public, and can't sell to anybody. Anyway, earlier in the year, a bunch of credulous oafs wrote an extremely long piece of fan fiction called "AI 2027," beguiling people like Kevin Roose with its "gloominess." Written with a deep seriousness and a lot of charts, AI 2027 makes massive leaps of logic, with its fans rationalizing taking it seriously by saying that the five authors "have the right credentials." In reality, AI 2027 is written to fool people that want to be fooled and scare people that are already scared, its tone consistently authoritative as it suggests that a self-learning agent is on the verge of waking up, a thing that is so remarkably stupid that anyone who took this seriously should be pantsed again and again. These men are also cowards. They choose to use fake company names like "OpenBrain" to mask their predictions instead of standing behind them with confidence. I get that extrapolating years into the future is scary — but these grifting losers can't even commit to a prediction! Nevertheless, I wanted to take a run at something similar myself, though not in the same narrative format. In this piece, I'm going to write out what conditions I believe will burst the bubble. Some of this will be extrapolations based on my own knowledge, sources, and writing hundreds of thousands of words on this subject. I am not going to write a strict timeline, but I am going to write how some things could go, and how (and why) they'll lead to the bubble bursting. For the bubble to burst, I see a few necessary conditions, though reality is often far more boring and annoying. Regardless, it's important to know that this is a bubble driven by vibes not returns, and thus the bubble bursting will be an emotional reaction. This post is, in many respects, a follow-on to my previous “pale horse” article (called Burst Damage). Many of my original pale horses have already come true — Anthropic and OpenAI have pushed price increases and rate limits, there is already discord in AI investment, Meta is already considering downsizing its AI team, and OpenAI has done multiple different "big, stupid magic tricks," the chief of them being the embarrassing launch of GPT-5, a "smart, efficient router" that I reported last week was quite the opposite. This time, I'm going to write out the linchpin events that will shock the system, and how they might bring about the bubble bursting. I should also be clear, and I will get to after the premium break, that this will be a series of events rather than one big one, though there are big ones to look out for. I also think it might "take a minute," because "the bubble bursting" will be a succession of events that could take upwards of a year to fully happen. That’s been true for every bubble. Although people associate the implosion of the housing bubble with the “one big event” of Lehman Brothers collapsing in 2008, the reality is that it was preceded and followed by a bunch of other events, equally significant though not quite as dramatic. One VC (who you'll read about shortly) predicted it will take 6 quarters to run out of funding entirely based on the current rate of investment, putting us around February 2027 for things to have truly collapsed. Here's a list of some of the things that I believe will have to happen for this era to be truly done, and the ones that I believe are truly essential. The common thread through all of these points is that they are predominantly impossible to ignore. So far this bubble has inflated because the problems with AI — such as "it doesn't make any money" and "burns billions of dollars" — have been dismissed until very recently as the necessary costs of the beautiful AI revolution. Now that things have begun to unravel, the intensity of criticism will increase gradually, rather than in one big movement that makes everyone say "we hate AI." And it isn't just because of the money. CEOs like Tobias Lutke of Shopify have oriented their companies’ entire culture around AI, demanding in his case that "employees must demonstrate why AI cannot be used before requesting additional resources." Generative AI is, on some level, a kind of dunce detector — its flimsy and vague use cases having enough juice to impress the clueless Business Idiots who don't really engage with the production that makes their companies money. The specious, empty hype of Large Language Models — driven by a tech and business media that has given up on trying to understand them — symbolizes a kind of magic to these empty-headed goobers, and unwinding their "AI-first" cultures will be difficult...right up until the first guy does it, at which point everybody will follow. AI has taken such a hold on our markets because it's symbolic of a few things: In any case, I am going to try and write the things that I think will happen, in detail. I'll go into more conditions in this piece, and as discussed, I'm going to make some informed guesses, extrapolations, and give my thoughts about how things collapse. I predict that the impact of Large Language Models over the next decade will be enormous, not in its actual innovation or returns, but in its ability to expose how little our leaders truly know about the world or labor, how willing many people are to accept whatever the last thing a smart-adjacent person said, and how our markets and economy are driven by people with the most tenuous grasp on reality. This will be an attempt to write down what I believe could happen in the next 18 months, the conditions that might accelerate the collapse, and how the answers to some of my open questions — such as how these companies book revenue and burn compute — could influence outcomes.

Title: Nvidia's earnings report will help to show whether the AI boom is overhyped or gaining steam

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: What was Jane Austen’s best novel? These experts think they know

View all partners https://doi.org/10.64628/AB.fj5u93ykx Share article Print article To mark the 250th anniversary of her birth, we’re pitting Jane Austen’s much-loved novels against each other in a battle of wit, charm and romance. Six leading Austen experts have made their case for her ultimate novel, but the winner is down to you. Cast your vote in the poll at the end of the article, and let us know the reason for your choice in the comments. This is Jane Austen Fight Club – it’s bonnets at dawn… Championed by Lucy Thompson, lecturer in 19th-century literature and creative writing, Aberystwyth University Sense and Sensibility is Austen’s most quietly radical novel. As her first published work, it may be less polished than her later fiction, but it is no less incisive. It lays bare the emotional cost of living in a world governed by reputation, family obligation and gendered expectation. Excluded from inheritance and displaced from their home, the Dashwood sisters must navigate constant scrutiny. Through Elinor and Marianne, Austen dramatises two strategies for survival in a society obsessed with appearances. Born from an earlier epistolary draft, the novel retains a sharp interest in how information circulates and misleads. Gossip doesn’t just constrain; it distorts. Letters are spied upon, conversations overheard. Assumptions take on the weight of fact. In this world, everyone watches – but not everyone truly sees. Sense and Sensibility may wear a quieter face than Emma or Pride and Prejudice, but it is Austen’s sharpest early critique of how appearances govern lives. This article is part of a series commemorating the 250th anniversary of Jane Austen’s birth. Despite having published only six books, she is one of the best-known authors in history. These articles explore the legacy and life of this incredible writer. Championed by Andrew McInnes, reader in English literature, Edge Hill University Everyone already knows the best Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice. Why? Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy is so charismatic that you might mistake the novel’s title for an abstract problem, and not Darcy’s pride versus her prejudice. We share her prejudices because Austen makes them so delicious. We roll our eyes at Mrs Bennet because Lizzy finds her exasperating. Wickham is seductive because he satisfies our inner bitch. And we fall in love with Darcy alongside Lizzy. Pride and Prejudice is the funniest and sexiest of Austen’s novels. In it, she allows herself a swoon-worthy romance without a hitch. Unlike Northanger Abbey’s Henry Tilney, Darcy doesn’t fall in love because Lizzy adores him, but falls first. Darcy is a complex man – shy, domineering, funny – and not a drip like Eds Ferrars (Sense and Sensibility) or Bertram (Mansfield Park). And unlike Emma, Lizzy builds healthy relationships with other women. Austen called Pride and Prejudice “too light and bright and sparkling” and joked that it could do with an essay on Walter Scott or Napoleon. But we know that would be a crime. It is just light and bright and sparkling enough to outshine the others. Championed by Amanda Vickery, professor in early modern history, Queen Mary University of London Pride and Prejudice is often the first grown-up novel young girls read, but Mansfield Park is the only Austen novel about a little girl growing up. All Austen’s fictions are versions of the female-centred courtship novel, usually covering a single year, with the heroine safely married to a deserving gentleman by the last page. Yet her heroines are mostly formed young women. Only in Mansfield Park do we meet our heroine as a little girl – and a puny and cowering little girl at that. Mansfield Park is Austen’s bildungsroman (the novel of becoming) on a par with that other girls’ classic, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre (1847). Like poor, plain Jane, Fanny Price is a girl of no consequence – a Cinderella figure in a mansion of the rich and selfish. Fanny is shy, frail and physically timid, but she is not a moral coward. She learns to bear her lot with dignity, and to hold fast to what she believes. By volume three, Fanny is at last the centre of her own story. Mansfield Park is not just a love story, it is a life story. Championed by Ruvani Ranasinha, professor of global literature, King’s College London Emma Woodhouse is Jane Austen’s most vividly realised, proto-feminist heroine. Witty, clever and attractive, Emma is supremely self-confident and flawed. She challenges every expectation of female propriety and is full of contradictions: self-centred yet deeply attached to her hypochondriac, indulgent father; snobbish but kind. Emma revels in meddling in the romantic lives of others, especially her protégée, Harriet Smith. When her carefully laid plans unravel, the busybody makes mortifying mistakes and learns self-knowledge: “It darted through her with the speed of an arrow, that Mr Knightley must marry no-one but herself!” All Austen’s novels are shot through with the awareness of the role of wealth and class in marriage. But Emma – “an heiress of thirty thousand pounds” – is free from the intense competition among the women for young men with positions and prospects. At the same time, she attracts men like Mr Elton seeking women with landed connections and dowries. This is why the novel both responds to Austen’s historical moment and speaks to our own. Championed by Octavia Cox, departmental lecturer in English literature, University of Oxford Northanger Abbey is a riot of jokes. Nobody and nothing is spared: not the heroine, convention, society – even readers. There’s everything marvellous you’d expect from an Austen novel (sharp satire of patriarchy and socioeconomic weaponisation, laughter at human absurdity and pompousness, beautifully wrought witty expression, a rollicking good yarn, irony), but with extra sass. Its bombastic intrusive authorial narrative voice (perhaps the closest we get to Austen’s own), constantly makes in-jokes with readers about the action. It’s Austen’s most meta-fictional text, playing with readers’ expectations about novels (for example, joking that her novel, ironically, “is a new circumstance in romance” despite depicting nothing “new in common life”). Its “defence of the novel” passage is a proto-feminist rallying call-to-arms for female authors to celebrate each other’s work. Northanger Abbey’s meta-fictionality reveals much about Austen’s aim and style as an author, making it a must-read for all Austen-lovers. Oh, and it’s funny. Damned funny. Championed by Richard de Ritter, lecturer in English literature, University of Leeds Persuasion contains the greatest love letter in all English literature. It is the culmination of a slow-burning romance between the heroine, Anne Elliot, and Captain Frederick Wentworth, the man she has loved for eight long years. “You pierce my soul,” Wentworth writes to Anne with striking vulnerability: “I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late.” (Spoiler: he is not too late.) The brilliance of Persuasion lies in the depiction of its complex heroine. At 27, Anne Elliot is older and wiser than Austen’s earlier protagonists. Disregarded by her comically narcissistic family, the depth of Anne’s personality is revealed by Austen’s prose style, which is at its most luminous and expressive. Readers are plunged into the mind of the novel’s heroine. We witness her innermost thoughts and feelings as she negotiates the awkwardness, excitement and, finally, the sheer joy of embracing a future with Wentworth. Persuasion is the final novel that Austen completed before her death in 1817: she was at the peak of her powers. It is her most moving and her greatest work.

The US chip giant is considered a bellwether for both the AI industry and Wall Street.

Over the past two years, the chipmaker has risen to become the world’s most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of more than $4 trillion. When Nvidia announces its earnings on Wednesday, investors will get to see how the tech giant has been faring amid the tumult of President Donald Trump’s trade salvoes and concerns about whether artificial intelligence has been overhyped. Nvidia specialises in making the graphics processing units (GPUs) that power AI, including the Blackwell B200, marketed as the world’s most powerful chip. The California-based company’s chips have become essential to the world’s largest tech companies, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, since AI exploded into the mainstream with the release of OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, in November 2022. The company’s portfolio also includes data centres and gaming. Nvidia posted annual revenue of $130.5bn for the last fiscal year, which ended in late January. Analysts will be examining various metrics, including the company’s quarterly revenue. Nvidia’s revenue has been growing at breakneck speed for the past several years, thanks to the AI boom and the surge in demand for its chips. Nvidia posted triple-digit revenue growth for five straight quarters between mid-2023 and 2024, according to company filings. Since then, annual revenue growth has coasted in the high double digits. Last quarter, the company reported revenue of $44.1bn, a 69 percent increase from the same period a year ago. While such figures would be the envy of any company, the firm’s explosive performance has also raised questions about how long its stellar run can last. In advance of its forthcoming earnings report – which covers the second quarter of fiscal year 2026 – Nvidia has said it expects revenue of $45bn plus or minus 2 percent. Analysts have predicted revenue of up to $46bn, or 53 percent growth year-on-year. The earnings report is also expected to show signs of whiplash from the Trump administration’s tariff war. In April, Trump banned Nvidia from selling its H20 chip – specially designed for the Chinese market – to China. At the time, Nvidia said the ban would cost the company $8bn. Trump later walked back the ban when Nvidia agreed to share 15 percent of its H20 chip sales with the US government, a deal that was finalised on August 11, two weeks after the end of its second quarter. As Silicon Valley pours billions into AI, some observers, such as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, have questioned whether there is a bubble. “Are we in a phase where investors as a whole are overexcited about AI? My opinion is, yes,” Altman told The Verge in an interview earlier this month. He is not the only one who is worried. Analysts have drawn parallels to the collapse of the “Nifty Fifty” in the 1970s, said Arun Sai, senior multi-asset strategist at Pictet Asset Management in the United Kingdom. The Nifty Fifty was a group of 50 of the most valuable companies in the US, including Xerox and IBM. Though highly profitable, the firms became highly overvalued in the late 1960s and early 70s. When the bubble burst following the 1973-74 stock market crash, the value of Nifty Fifty stocks fell by more than 50 percent. “They were fantastic companies, but they were trading on the wrong price,” Sai told Al Jazeera. “This is the old notion of you could be a great company, but not a great stock if the price is wrong.” Five decades later, some investors are asking whether the “Magnificent Seven” – Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla – could be overvalued as well. Valuations have soared into the trillions of dollars on the back of the AI boom, although there is some divergence within the group, with Apple and Tesla faring less well recently. Amazon recently said it expects to spend $85bn on AI over the next year, while Microsoft predicts it will spend $100bn. AI has been one of the few bright spots in an otherwise slowing economy that has been undergoing upheaval since Trump took office. “Growth is dwindling in other sectors, but there is this very small, niche, concentrated pocket of hyper growth,” Sai said. “This suddenly becomes a much bigger contributor to US GDP growth than it would have been in a normal phase of the cycle.” Corporate spending on AI has been likened to an arms race, but tech giants – and Nvidia customers – will also sooner or later need to show investors that their betting on the sector will lead to profits. US tech giants are already facing challenges from companies like China’s DeepSeek, which made global headlines in January when it unveiled a powerful but much cheaper AI model. So far, innovation does not appear to be translating into higher returns. In a recent survey by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 95 percent of enterprises looked at reported no return on their AI investments despite the billions ploughed into the sector. Because of its sky-high valuation, Nvidia alone makes up almost 8 percent of the S&P500 – the benchmark index of 500 top companies listed on the US stock market. That means Nvidia’s earnings have the potential to have a significant impact, good or bad, on the stock market as a whole. Big movements in Nvidia’s stock price have triggered swings in the S&P 500 of 1 percent or more in the past. After Nvidia’s earnings results in February sent its share price down more than 8 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.6 percent. Follow Al Jazeera English:

SAN FRANCISCO -- Chipmaker Nvidia will release a quarterly report Wednesday that could provide a better sense of whether the stock market has been riding an overhyped artificial intelligence bubble or is being propelled by a technological boom that's still gathering momentum. Nvidia become the first publicly traded company to surpass a market value of $4 trillion last month, and its stock price has gained another 13% since then to create an additional $500 billion in shareholder wealth. The latest financial results are due out Wednesday afternoon. They have become a key AI barometer during the past two years because Nvidia makes most of the chips that power the technology in vast data centers at the center of the boom. This summer's run-up has continued Nvidia's jaw-dropping rise from early 2023, when the company's market value was hovering around $400 billion. That was shortly after OpenAI's late 2022 release of its ChatGPT chatbot triggered the biggest craze in technology since Apple released the first iPhone in 2007. While the technology industry has been the biggest beneficiary of the AI frenzy, it's also been a boon for the overall stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 68% since the end of 2022, with AI fervor fueling much of the investor optimism. But even amid the general euphoria, there recently have been murmurs about whether AI mania will prove to be an echo of the late 1990s dot-com boom that culminated in an excruciating stock market meltdown in 2000 that eventually drove the U.S. economy and plunged Silicon Valley into a funk that lasted several years before the tech industry began to thrive again. Investors were recently spooked by a combination of an MIT report that said 95% of AI pilots fail and comments from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman floating the idea that the artificial intelligence market is in a bubble. And by some metrics, the stock prices of tech companies at the AI are looking frothy. For instance, Nvidia is trading at about 40 times its future earnings, roughly double the rate that investors traditionally believe is a reasonable level. Meanwhile, the market value of Microsoft, another AI leader, is hovering just below $4 trillion, while the values of other fellow pacesetters Amazon, Facebook parent Meta Platforms and Google parent Alphabet currently range from $1.9 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Nvidia is expected to post another quarter of robust growth for the May-July period of its fiscal year. Analysts surveyed by FactSet research predict Nvidia will earn $1.01 per share, excluding certain items unrelated to its ongoing business, which would be a 49% increase from the same time last year. The analysts anticipated Nvidia's revenue would rise 53% from a year ago to about $46 billion. Those gains reflect the financial tsunami flooding the AI market as the biggest players spend heavily to build and expand data centers needed to power the technology. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta are collectively budgeting more than $325 billion for investments in AI this year. With its dominant position in the AI chip market, Nvidia is reaping the benefits of that intense demand. Even so, the trajectory of Nvidia's growth has been tapering off. If analyst projections pan out, Nvidia's revenue growth for its latest quarter will be significantly lower than the 122% increase it posted during the same period last year. And Nvidia has also been losing business because of President Donald Trump's trade war with China. Following a ban on its AI chip sales in China, which resulted in a $4.5 billion blow to its finances during its fiscal first quarter, Nvidia estimated that the restrictions would cost it about approximately $8 billion in sales in this during the past quarter. Trump took the China handcuffs off of Nvidia earlier this month in return for a 15% cut of the company's sales in that country — a compromise CEO Jensen Huang is expected to discuss with analysts while he shares his perspective on the state of the AI market on a call with investors. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: AI’s $1 Trillion Shakeout: Bubble, Correction, Or Market Reset
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/markminevich/2025/08/26/ais-1-trillion-shakeout-bubble-correction-or-market-reset/
Time Published: 2025-08-27T00:32:46Z

ByMark Minevich, Contributor. In recent weeks, AI investors and enterprise leaders have felt the yo-yo effect of the AI market. Starting August 18, a four-day slide erased almost $1 trillion from the market caps of tech’s megacap companies. Nvidia, Palantir, and other so-called AI companies shed billions in value in a matter of days. Meta has announced a hiring freeze in its AI division. Even the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, casually remarked that “AI is a bubble.” The irony? Engineers in the sector continue to command $100 million pay packages. AI startups continue to raise funding at valuations that defy gravity. Additionally, companies from Microsoft to Google are integrating AI features across their products at a record speed. The real question isn’t whether AI is a bubble. The better question is: what kind of bubble—if any—are we in, and what comes after? For much of the past 18 months, AI stocks soared based on projections and expectations. Nvidia tripled in value. Palantir’s valuations are reminiscent of the dot-com era. In August, the S&P’s price-to-book ratio reached 5.3, which is higher than the 2000 bubble peak. When valuations stretch that far, even small doubts can trigger outsized sell-offs. The rotation out of AI has been partly seasonal. August is historically weak for equities, and funds have been taking profits in overcrowded trades. However, the speed and depth of AI’s decline reveal something deeper: investors are finally asking tough questions about the business impact. New data fueled that scrutiny. A report from MIT showed that 95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver any measurable return on investment. McKinsey research similarly found that while 8 in 10 companies deploy generative AI tools, most see no bottom-line gains. AI may be everywhere in boardrooms and demos, but it remains conspicuously absent from earnings statements. This fact is what caused markets to dip. The MIT statistic shouldn’t surprise seasoned executives. Many companies are treating AI as a marketing checkbox rather than a strategic capability. Money is being funneled into headline-grabbing initiatives, such as customer-facing chatbots and generative content tools. At the same time, the real ROI lies hidden in back-office automation, supply chain optimization, and finance functions. The most significant determinant of success isn’t the model itself, but how it’s adopted and integrated. Companies that prioritize impressive demos without redesigning workflows inevitably fail. By contrast, enterprises that embed AI into core processes (expense reporting, claims processing, compliance checks) consistently see measurable productivity gains. Another issue is the obsession with building in-house. For many organizations, partnering with trusted vendors provides faster time-to-value and avoids the talent bottleneck. Trying to replicate what OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google has already done internally often results in wasted human hours and failed pilots. Then there’s the problem of “agent sprawl.” As different departments spin up their own AI pilots, enterprises risk a patchwork of ungoverned tools, inconsistent security, and rising costs. Without a governance model that scales, these initiatives collapse under their own weight. The reality is that adoption strategy, not AI hype, determines ROI. The mixed signals coming from industry leaders further complicate the picture. Sam Altman’s “AI is a bubble” remark spooked investors, although insiders suggest his comments were directed at the valuations of huge startups, not giants like OpenAI or Nvidia. Some even speculate it was a tactical move, cooling off competitors such as Meta, which had been luring OpenAI engineers with $100 million signing packages. Meta’s AI hiring freeze may appear ominous on the surface, but the company is actually spending more than ever on AI infrastructure. The shift isn’t about retreat, but about moving from a talent land-grab to execution. In fact, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are quietly doubling down on AI integration across products that generate real revenue. Plus, Nvidia, despite stock swings, reported data center revenue up nearly 70% year-over-year. This further drives home the point that the infrastructure layer of AI is delivering tangible profits. The signs of a bubble are undeniable with valuations stretched to dot-com levels, engineers signing contracts worth nine figures and a 95% project failure rate in enterprise pilots. But there are equally strong signs that this is merely a correction. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are not speculative bets; they’re profitable, cash-rich companies building foundational technologies. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are not Pets.com. A more useful analogy may be the early internet. In 1995, valuations were huge, startups were burning cash, and most experiments failed. But beneath the noise, the infrastructure for a digital economy was being laid. The productivity payoff lagged the hype, but when it arrived, it reshaped the global economy. AI is following a similar trajectory. In the near term, volatility is unavoidable. Valuations will continue to be tested. Venture funding will tighten, forcing weak AI startups into consolidation or collapse. Public companies that heavily rely on AI marketing without demonstrating effective adoption will remain under pressure. The headlines and hype around $100 million salaries and “AI everywhere” marketing will cool. Many projects will be quietly wound down as the easy money phase of AI comes to an end. AI is not a feature, it is a general-purpose technology on par with electricity and the internet. It is already transforming healthcare, energy, finance, defense, logistics, and education. The productivity paradox is fundamental, as significant investments must come first and measurable gains follow later. Just as the internet required massive infrastructure before creating trillions in value, AI requires time to mature and integrate. By 2030, analysts project AI will add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Most startups will vanish, but the survivors (likely fewer than 5%) will dominate entire industries. The next decade will see the rise of new global giants, and the reshaping of competition across every sector. We’re not witnessing the end of AI, we’re witnessing the end of its hype cycle. The startup bubble is deflating. The talent war is cooling. But the underlying trend of AI as a driver of productivity, transformation, and new business models is only beginning. This is not a dot-com bus, but a recalibration of expectations. Execution will matter more than narrative. The adoption strategy will matter more than the experiments. Enterprises that focus on back-office productivity, integration, and governance will capture real ROI. In the short term, expect volatility, pain, and consolidation. In the long term, expect AI to weave into every industry and redefine productivity, creativity, and competition. Yes, some air is coming out, but AI itself is no bubble. The future belongs to AI. The only question is which enterprises will survive the shakeout and lead the next industrial revolution.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T16:57:44Z

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Title: $25 for that? Consumers are going elsewhere for lunch.

Good morning. Last night, US President Donald Trump said he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook "effective immediately." In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump said there was "sufficient reason" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements. In response, Cook said Trump has no authority to fire her and she will not resign. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, fast casual chains like Chipotle and Cava are losing their freshness. What's on deck: Markets: Why Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad won't save American Eagle's stock. Tech: A mix of AI FOMO and fear is sweeping Hollywood. Business: Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. But first, the rise and fall of the fast-casual slop bowl. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Let's grab lunch — my treat. Anywhere you want, as long as it's not Chipotle, Cava, or Sweetgreen. You expect me to pay $25 for … that? They've been dubbed "slop bowls," those mounds of vegetables, grains, and a protein or two. They were all the rage in the 2010s. Now, they could be why some fast casual chains are losing out, BI's Emily Stewart writes. The complaints are piling up: warm, weird salads; ingredients combined in the wrong way; portions so small, customers are filming employees just to try and get more food. And for the privilege? A price tag that makes you want to hurl. "Value is front of mind for nearly every consumer right now, and I think these restaurants just don't have a sharp enough value proposition," says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. So consumers appear to be going elsewhere, to places where, if they're spending that kind of money, they can sit down and get a better experience. Places that feel more affordable, more satisfying. Places like Chili's. Chili's has been on a hot streak. In its most recent earnings report, the CEO of Chili's parent company, Brinker, took a victory lap, declaring: "Chili's is officially back, baby back." The chain posted impressive sales growth, pushing Brinker's revenue past Wall Street's expectations to $1.46 billion. Alex Fasciano, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, noted that Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and The Cheesecake Factory have also had a strong year. Part of that growth may come from value-conscious diners tired of paying more for less. "Why am I paying $25 for a burrito and chips and guac when I could pay maybe a little bit more and have full service?" Fasciano says. With more of us heading back into the office, many are only just realising how expensive these slop bowls have gotten. What started as a slightly more expensive, healthier alternative to fast food now feels overpriced and underwhelming. As America's slop bowl moment fades, the next big thing might just be a full plate and a fair price. 1. Trump has bought $100 million in bonds since starting his second term. That's according to a new filing from the Office of Government Ethics. The president's bond purchases could stand to benefit if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, which Trump has been pressuring the central bank to do for months. 2. Behind Palantir's bad month. The tech titan's stock was flying high in 2025, reaching a record high in mid-August before shares fell 17%. Investors are feeling hesitant about Palantir's stock for three reasons, but optimism remains strong around its long-term trajectory. 3. Sydney Sweeney can't keep American Eagle's stock afloat. Bank of America analysts cut their rating on the stock to "underperform," citing the negative impact of tariffs. Any positive impact from Sweeney's jeans ad, including its rise to meme stock fame last month, will get canceled out, the firm said. 1. How Hollywood is using AI on the hush. Entertainment giants like Netflix and Lionsgate have recently touted their embrace of AI, but the tech still has a stigma among the creative community. Five Hollywood insiders told BI they dread being associated with AI, and those who are using it are doing so in secret. 2. Meta continues to poach AI talent for its superintelligence team. Meta has recruited at least 10 previously unreported researchers from Google's DeepMind since July, according to LinkedIn data reviewed by BI. The tech giant has also targeted Scale AI, with six of its AI researchers announcing their departures to join Meta in recent weeks. 3. OpenAI ramps up its healthcare push with a new hire. The company has tapped Doximity cofounder Nate Gross to lead its growing healthcare business. OpenAI aims to sell directly to healthcare customers rather than power other companies' products, reflecting a larger pivot: it wants to own not just foundation models, but AI infrastructure and applications, too. 1. Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. The popular dolls are on track to do $1 billion in sales this year, according to EMARKETER. And although they are no Beanie Babies, it's hard to imagine that Labubus will still be popular years from now, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 2. Burning Man kicks up business deals, too. Tech moguls, celebrities, and models flock to the Black Rock Desert every year for the Burning Man festival. But they do more than just party: Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, are among the leaders who have made key business decisions amid the dusty festivities. 3. Why this app's CEO will cancel a user's $25K subscription. Dorsia lets its users snag reservations at top restaurants for either $175, $5,175, or $25,175 a year. CEO Marc Lotenberg says he's kicked several users off the platform since its launch in 2022, and told BI "being rude to servers" is a bannable offense. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: Is Passive Investing Creating A Bubble?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesmoss/2025/08/26/is-passive-investing-creating-a-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T11:37:08Z

ByWes Moss, Contributor. Is one of the most popular investing strategies quietly distorting the stock market? As index funds attract trillions, several outlets—including Barron’s and Harper’s Magazine—have voiced concern that a passive investing bubble could be forming. The core argument is that too much money is chasing too few stocks. Passive investing—through index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—has become so dominant that it funnels an enormous volume of investor capital into a shrinking pool of mega-cap names such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, for example, which often sit at the top of major index fund holdings. Because these funds are market-cap weighted, larger stocks attract proportionally more capital. That can create a feedback loop, where rising stock prices trigger more buying, which in turn pushes prices higher. Critics, such as Michael Green of Simplify Asset Management, warn that this dynamic may warp prices and inflate a bubble that could burst if flows reverse. They also worry that because index funds are essentially buy-and-hold vehicles, they don’t actively contribute to price discovery—the process that determines what a stock is truly worth based on supply and demand. Yet others push back. Steve Johnson at Financial Times, for instance, notes new research suggesting the “…surge in passive money has made equity markets more efficient, contradicting some previous research that has found the opposite.” Zooming out provides more perspective. According to Boston Consulting Group, global assets under management (AUM) hit $128 trillion by the end of 2024. Passive strategies grew to 20% of total global AUM by the end of 2024. There’s no doubt these figures are substantial, but they are far from overwhelming. While recent estimates indicate that systematic and passive strategies combined make up more than 60% of daily U.S. equity trading volume, pure passive index-tracking flows appear to represent a much smaller portion. In Q1 2023, ETFs—including both passive and active funds—comprised 32% of U.S. equity trading volume, according to the ICI 2024 Fact Book (p. 61). Even at the end of 2023, passive index-tracking mutual funds and ETFs accounted for just 18% of total U.S. stock market ownership—a figure that may rise to 30–35% when including other passive strategies—keeping in mind that while ownership data helps gauge influence, it doesn’t directly reflect how often positions are traded. This highlights a key point: truly passive flows are only a subset of ETF activity and likely make up a modest portion of total market turnover. Passive investing began gaining traction in 1976, when Vanguard founder Jack Bogle launched the first retail index mutual fund. Since then, index-based strategies have become a cornerstone of modern portfolio construction. By offering typically lower costs, broad market exposure, and built-in diversification, passive investing has attracted significant inflows from investors seeking long-term, market-matching performance. And despite concerns to the contrary, price discovery still occurs. Even when passive holds a sizable chunk of assets, active traders can still dictate equity and bond values. Hedge funds, portfolio managers, and individual investors continue to trade billions of dollars daily based on earnings reports, valuations, and other market signals. This activity helps play a critical role in maintaining market efficiency. Morningstar's March 2024 U.S. Active/Passive Barometer analyzed over 9,000 unique U.S. funds representing $23 trillion in assets—about 68% of the U.S. fund market. Yes, passive funds have attracted more inflows for nine straight years, but active funds still account for more than half of total U.S. assets. So, while passive investing is significant—and growing—it doesn’t appear to be the all-consuming force some critics make it out to be. Regardless of the rise in passive allocation, active investing is anticipated to continue playing a vital role for many reasons. Individuals pursue hands-on strategies in an attempt to beat the market, to invest in their values, to take activist positions, or even because they think they can outsmart their peers. In short, investors generally do continue to care about their money, suggesting active management is likely to remain relevant. The real surprise? Active managers outperformed passive funds far more often than headlines might suggest. Referring back to Morningstar’s March 2024 Active/Passive Barometer: As long as active funds are beating their benchmarks, market dynamics reasonably imply continued participation from investors, portfolio managers, and institutions actively trading, researching, and trying to outperform. For those concerned that algorithmic or computer-driven trading may fuel a passive bubble, it’s worth noting that these technologies have been embedded in market operations for decades. Rather than introducing a new risk, they’ve long been a foundational part of how modern markets function. While vigilance is warranted, the evidence suggests that market concentration risks are manageable. Passive investing does come with its own set of risks, as does any strategy. But data and market history indicate abundant competition from active investors, which doesn’t support the idea that current trends are inflating a bubble. There is clearly still sustained interest in active investing, which suggests a low probability of the market losing its ability to function properly. The fact that 42% of active funds beat their passive peers in all categories in 2024, and even more so in real estate and bonds, underscores how active management remains a key force in price discovery, even as passive strategies grow. Investors are expected to continue utilizing passive strategies as one piece of a thoughtfully constructed portfolio that often includes active avenues as well. Passive investing isn’t perfect, but the data fail to support the argument that it poses an imminent systemic risk.

Title: OpenAI taps Instagram and Doximity execs to lead its next AI healthcare push
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-taps-doximity-cofounder-to-lead-its-next-healthcare-push-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-26T09:00:01Z

OpenAI is ramping up its push into healthcare with two high-profile new hires. The AI powerhouse has tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder and former chief strategy officer of Doximity, and Ashley Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to lead the next phase of its healthcare business. Gross joined OpenAI in June, while Alexander assumed her role on Tuesday, according to their LinkedIn profiles. An OpenAI spokesperson said Gross will lead OpenAI's healthcare strategy, with early goals including co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers. Alexander will be a vice president of product in OpenAI's health business, building tech for individual consumers and clinicians, the spokesperson said. Until now, OpenAI has mostly powered other companies' products and partnered on medical AI research, rather than competing directly with its own healthcare tech. But the company has been telegraphing its expanding healthcare ambitions for months. CEO Sam Altman spotlighted ChatGPT's healthcare skills during the August launch of GPT-5, calling the model "a legitimate Ph.D. expert." "It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey," Altman said, adding that GPT-5 performed "exceptionally well" on health-related questions. That performance was validated by HealthBench, OpenAI's first stand-alone healthcare tool, released in May. The open-source benchmark lets health systems, startups, and tech firms evaluate the accuracy and safety of health AI applications. OpenAI's healthcare ambitions reflect a larger pivot: OpenAI wants to own not just foundation models but also the infrastructure and AI applications built on top of them. In education, it launched Study Mode, a ChatGPT spinoff for students, in July to compete with Google's Gemini for Education. It demoed an AI sales agent in February, and rolled out an agentic tool that books reservations and shops for users in July. Healthcare AI is already crowded with tech giants. Palantir began developing AI for hospitals in 2021. Microsoft launched cloud-based clinician tools in 2020 and has since deepened ties with medical-records giant Epic to use AI in notetaking. Gross and Alexander's new roles at OpenAI aim to help the AI juggernaut pick up the pace. The OpenAI spokesperson said the company thinks "improving human health will be one of the defining impacts of AGI." Gross has deep roots in digital health. He cofounded Doximity 15 years ago as a "LinkedIn for doctors." In 2023, Doximity launched Doximity GPT, built on OpenAI tech, to help physicians with administrative tasks. So far this year, Doximity has acquired AI clinical evidence company Pathway Medical for $63 million and launched its own free AI scribe to compete with the likes of Microsoft and $5.3 billion startup Abridge. Doximity is one of the few healthcare companies that went public in 2021's IPO frenzy that isn't currently in the red. Despite significant share price fluctuations in the past four years, Doximity's stock is up over 60% above its opening price at IPO. Gross is also the cofounder of digital health investment and research firm Rock Health. Alexander worked at Meta for 12 years, 11 of which she spent on Instagram's product team, building out many of the app's features for advertising, creator monetization, and video content. OpenAI's health AI research to date has been spearheaded by Karan Singal, a former Google researcher who helped lead the development of the tech giant's medical LLM Med-PaLM. Singal will continue to run OpenAI's healthcare AI research, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI is hiring for at least two other roles in its health business. Its careers page lists openings for a health AI research scientist and a healthcare software engineer. Despite its plans to compete more directly with health startups, OpenAI isn't ditching its partnerships. The company most recently announced a collaboration with Kenyan primary care provider Penda Health in July to assess Penda Health's AI clinical copilot built on OpenAI's GPT-4o. It also continues to power the technology behind companies like pediatric care startup Summer Health and health insurtech Oscar Health. Jump to

From Wired, “What Does Palantir Actually Do?”: Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance. But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it’s a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist… The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It’s really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it’s hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?” Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is… Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.” Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir’s flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart? Part of the answer may lie in Palantir’s marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir’s main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. What it’s ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”… Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir’s offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan. Crucially, Palantir doesn’t reorganize a company’s bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn’t change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer’s messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it’s a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s. Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors… Palantir’s software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir’s two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users. Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry. Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they’re ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any. A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person’s network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver’s license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos… In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people’s intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir’s users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it. “It’s a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it’s in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.” ****** I quite enjoyed the Economist's article on Palantir: "Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time What would make it worth buying?" So sad to see the bubble bursting at bit. So very sad. www.economist.com/finance-and-… [image or embed] — notsewmot.bsky.social (@notsewmot.bsky.social) August 20, 2025 at 6:34 PM The Economist asks, “What Would Make It Worth Buying?” … No one can accuse Palantir, a data-analysis outfit and the most searingly hot stock of 2025, of unspectacular growth. It reported revenue of $1bn for the second quarter of this year, 48% higher than for the second quarter of 2024 and quadruple the figure for the same period in 2020. Silicon Valley types seek out companies satisfying the “rule of 40”, meaning that the sum of their operating margin and year-on-year sales growth, both expressed in percentage points, is higher than 40. Palantir’s score on that measure is 94: higher than any other enterprise-software firm with equivalent or greater sales. Among the world’s 25 biggest companies by market value—of which Palantir is one—only Nvidia, with its near-monopoly on artificial-intelligence chips, scores higher. Any investor would want a piece of that. The trouble is that Palantir’s market value has already soared to $430bn (see chart 1), more than 600 times its past year’s earnings and nearly triple the equivalent multiple for Cisco (or, indeed, Nvidia) at its peak. Software firms often prefer to express their valuation in terms of underlying sales, which puts Palantir’s multiple at around 120. For comparison, in 2005, the year before the Oxford English Dictionary added the verb “Google”, Google’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 22. You need not look far to explain why Adam Parker of Trivariate Research, an investment firm, has published a note entitled “Could Palantir be the best short idea?” Writing in late May, he examined the ratio of enterprise value (which adjusts market value to account for debt and cash on the balance-sheet) to forecast sales for the coming year. On this measure Palantir then scored 73 and now scores 104. Mr Parker looked for other listed companies that had hit a multiple of 70 since 2000. Excluding financial firms and those with annual revenue of less than $50m, he found 14, the largest of which has a market value around a quarter of Palantir’s. That was Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a firm that sells some software but pitches itself to investors as a “bitcoin treasury company”, with a value derived from its cryptocurrency holdings rather than its sales… What, then, would it take to make Palantir’s shares worth buying? The firm helps everyone from spooks to fast-food chains analyse their data better and thereby improve their operations. Its blistering recent growth comes, in large part, from enthusiasm over adopting AI for such purposes. Palantir’s competitive advantage derives not just from its software and clever engineers, but from a high-level security clearance allowing it to process classified information from America’s defence and intelligence agencies. This gives it a “moat” with which to fend off competitors… Sustained revenue growth of that magnitude or more is possible, even at Palantir’s scale: Google (now called Alphabet), Meta and Nvidia have all managed it. Yet none was priced to do so in advance—and they are, after all, among the most successful firms in history. On a call with analysts and investors after announcing Palantir’s most recent results, Alex Karp, the chief executive (pictured), admitted that “this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter.” The remarkable thing is that shareholders need the company’s revenue to continue to grow at a similar rate just to have a good chance of breaking even. There is no allowance for an upstart competitor, a scandal that makes clients wary or even a mere slowdown. If any of those strike, Cisco will need to make way for a new cautionary tale. Once we turf out the current batch of malefactors, could an honest administration pull Palantir’s vaunted security clearance, possibly while Peter Thiel stands before a Truth & Reconciliation Commission? ****** Fairness requirement: Strenuous argument against Palantir’s whole existence: Palantir: the world’s most evil company open.substack.com/pub/politica… [image or embed] — Ck (@ck-100.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 6:40 PM Filter No commenters available.

Tolkien, who is both FAR more honorable and FAR more significant than they ever will be! Old School August 25, 2025 at 7:05 pm I’m unclear as to whether Palantir is actually capable of producing the Navy and Air Force projects. Or is completion not really a deciding factor here? bbleh August 25, 2025 at 7:08 pm @Old School: this being the Trump era (see also Musk, Elon), I’m guessing that actually DOING things as opposed simply to talking about them and scooping up money from the gullible is … not a priority.

Betty August 25, 2025 at 7:19 pm I would like to know if the existing contractors have a cause of action against Palantir for interfering in their contracts. Carlo Graziani August 25, 2025 at 7:28 pm There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham… …which makes it sound like the highest-value nation-state cyberattack target in the observable universe. Get into Apollo, and you can covertly push malware into the data analytics software of securocracies and tech companies in the US and abroad. I sincerely hope they take their security very seriously. Dorothy A. Winsor August 25, 2025 at 7:35 pm I saw the headline and thought “the palantir is a communication device.” But no. Wrong universe. Martin August 25, 2025 at 7:54 pm @Old School: Hard to tell without more details. But Palantir basically specializes in recognizing a companies technical debt, and rather than helping a company solve it, just layer a new system on top that uses AI, etc. to try and replicate what your system ought to be doing, but in a different way. For instance in my career I was fairly notorious for building tools that could solve problems that the maintainers of the data couldn’t do. Their systems were collect information on students, or research expenditures, or payroll, etc but the tools weren’t designed to give broad insights on what was happening in those areas. They were useful for tracking A student, or A grant, or AN employee, but not seeing larger patterns. One way to solve that problem is to rework your tools so they are capable of doing that, but these tools are generally designed to enforce processes, and as such they are the laws of your organization in code, and reworking them can be very expensive, because any departures from how they worked before are effectively rewriting the laws of your organization. When I wasn’t part of the group responsible for the tool, but was tasked with providing the insight, rewriting the tools wasn’t an option – I didn’t own that system. Instead, I’d scrape that system in one way or another – pull from their dataset if I could get that permission, but as a last resort simply build a tool that emulated an employee accessing their tool and just scrape records from their UI. And from their data build a new tool that was designed to give the insight we needed – focusing on groups of students, demographics, categories of research or faculty, etc. You don’t need to rewrite the tool this way. It’s a way for an organization to neglect their technical debt a while longer but also can help an organization see the need to abstract their policy enforcement through code from their data from their code analysis. This is kind of what the microservices design pattern seeks to do as well. It’s not a bad approach, though if you are using it to neglect your technical debt it’s bad. Palantir does two things, from what I understand: Marc August 25, 2025 at 8:32 pm A year or so after 9/11 I was working on code with the PhD students for an “NSF” grant (we used to go to the sponsor’s meetings at the Ft Meade Travelodge) to look at communications flow between teams of workers on massive construction projects (nuclear plants, transit systems, etc.). This involved collecting massive amounts of metadata (no content) associated with email, CAD file updates, project change orders, and milestone completions. With some statistical analysis that could converted into an abstract model of the actual (as opposed to formal) organizational structure that would drive a simulation. Then we’d run the simulation thousands of times using genetic and ML algorithms to determine the “optimal” organizational structures for cost/schedule on future similar projects. Or, you could also figure out whom to remove to ensure that a project would never reach completion. That, among other things, is what Palantir does. JaneE August 26, 2025 at 12:33 am I don’t understand how Palantir could “overhaul antiquated human resources systems” if all it does is extract the old data from the existing antiquated system and give the users tools to generate analyses and give them better access to the old data. It would be a band-aid for the old system to let the users have better data until the system were overhauled. At that point the users would have the choice of whatever the newer system offered or let Palantir hoover up the new data to generate their analyses and reports. How does Palantir add new information if they don’t actually change the old system? I worked on those antiquated systems when they were new. Unless they actually have been updated to the newer languages and database structures getting information out is limited by what can be put in in the first place. If they already have all the data they need and just want to get additional views of the information without the time of programming it this might be a good solution, but that doesn’t sound like what the scrapped project was doing. Even if the Palantir solution is a good fit for what they want(ed) to do, this scrapping 12 years (and who knows how many man-years) of work because they want a specific (well connected politically) company to be given a chance to bid sounds like a totally corrupt deal. They didn’t bid 12 years ago – for whatever reason – so scrapping the current contractor really is nothing but political. Do the procurement regulations allow that type of patronage contracting? Aaron August 27, 2025 at 1:12 am @JaneE: Sounds like a good time to be wrapping up a boatload of acquisition deregulation, doesn’t it? Your email address will not be published.

Title: Can Meta Platforms Stock Hit $800 By The End Of 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/can-meta-platforms-stock-hit-800-by-end-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T19:51:08Z

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Given Meta Platform’s strong Q2 performance, modest valuation compared to Google and Microsoft, and optimistic growth forecasts, Meta stock is likely to top $800 within weeks. Whether the stock continues to rise depends on whether the company reports Q3 results that beat expectations and raises its forecasts for Q4 growth and profitability. If Meta falls short on Q3 growth or Q4 guidance, the stock could tumble way below $800 by the end of 2025. Read on for a discussion of how much Meta’s stock has risen so far this year, the forces propelling and impeding the company’s growth, how the Facebook parent’s valuation compares to rivals and where analysts see the stock going in the next year. Meta stock has been on a roll. In 2024, shares of the Facebook parent increased 69% – rising from $354 to $600 a share. As of August 25, Meta shares had risen another 26% to $755. With a mere 3% more to rise to reach $800 a share, Meta appears more likely than not to surpass that target by the end of 2025. Meta's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and its strong core advertising business, coupled with a vast user base, present significant growth opportunities for the company. Meta's core ad business remains robust, with strong revenue growth in 2025 driven by AI-enhanced ad targeting, increased advertiser adoption of AI tools and higher engagement across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Threads. AI integration has led to increased conversion rates for ads, particularly on Reels, according to AInvest. Meta continues to see growth in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads with daily active users growing 6% to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Improved content recommendation algorithms and features like Reels contribute to increased time spent on the platforms, further enhancing the advertising opportunity, Zacks noted. Meta's aggressive investments in AI infrastructure, including data centers and AI models like Llama 4, could help the company’s business lines grow. The Meta AI chatbot and assistant are gaining traction, nearing one billion monthly active users, suggesting potential for AI-driven experiences and new revenue streams. Meta's AI strategy also includes AI-powered glasses and potential enterprise applications for businesses, SeekingAlpha wrote. Meta posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, showing its core ad business remains strong at a time when the company is investing billions of dollars into AI. The results show the extent to which Meta’s advertising business will continue to pay for its outsize AI ambitions, as well as how the AI tools are contributing to its strength, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta beat analyst expectations and increased guidance. Sales came in at $47.5 billion, ahead of analyst expectations. Net income for the second quarter was $18.3 billion, also ahead of market expectations. Cost-cutting measures and a focus on efficiency also contributed to Meta’s healthy financial position, the Journal noted. Meta also said it expects to post between 17% and 24% revenue growth for the current quarter. “The investments it’s making in AI are already paying off in its ads business,” eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Journal. Meta also faces hurdles — including regulatory pressures, high capital expenditures for AI and the continued losses in its Reality Labs division. Meta faces intense competition in both the social media and digital advertising sectors from established players like Google and emerging platforms like TikTok, as well as from new entrants in AI. TikTok is a significant threat to Meta's social media dominance and the Facebook parent’s ability to attract advertising. Google and OpenAI are key competitors in the development of AI capabilities, particularly regarding large language models, according to Variety. Meta faces many regulatory challenges, particularly in the European Union and the United States. The European Digital Markets Act could reduce Meta’s European ad revenue in the second half of 2025, according to Team SciDA, while an ongoing FTC antitrust lawsuit poses the risk of forced divestitures of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported Wired. The Reality Labs division, Meta's metaverse and VR/AR segment, continues to operate at a significant loss, raising questions about its long-term viability and return on investment. Meta's Reality Labs division reported $4.53 billion in the second quarter of 2025, despite generating $370 million in revenue, according to Digital Music News. This loss is a result of investments in VR and AR technologies, including the Meta Quest headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Meta's increased capital spending for AI infrastructure (estimated between $64 billion and $72 billion for 2025) could pressure margins and profitability in the short term, according to InvestorsObserver. It remains to be seen whether these large capital investments will result in a better return on investment than has the company’s investments in the metaverse — which prompted the company’s name change from Facebook. While sporting a moderate valuation compared to peers, Meta’s stock price, revenue growth, and net margin have outpaced those of Google and Microsoft. Here are the details: Based on short-term price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $866.92. The forecasts range from a low of $658.00 to a high of $1,086.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.84% from the last closing price of $782.13, according to Zacks Research. One analyst was impressed with Meta’s Q2 report – raising his high price target to $900. "What was that? WOW," Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said in a client note featured by Investor’s Business Daily. "Meta destroyed expectations with perhaps one of the biggest prints in their history." Wedbush's Meta stock analyst Scott Devitt raised his price target from $750 to $920, reported IBD. Meta stock needs to rise 3% more to top $800 by the end of 2025. It is likely that will happen as long as Meta beats growth expectations and raises guidance when it presents its next earnings report.
