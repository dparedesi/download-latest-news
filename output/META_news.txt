Title: Somnium VR1 Price Increases Bring Base Model To €3000

Somnium VR1, the European wide field of view PC VR headset, has just received a price increase for all three remaining variants, bringing the entry price to €3000. It comes two weeks after the company announced it had started shipping to the US, and simplified its lineup down from seven consumer variants to three. Somnium is a Czech startup previously solely focused on its social VR platform Somnium Space. But in late 2021 it announced the Somnium VR1 headset with a monster spec sheet for the time, in partnership with VRgineers - known for its ultra-high end XTAL headsets for enterprise. Originally Somnium VR1 was pitched as a hybrid headset with standalone capabilities via an onboard Snapdragon XR2 chipset, but that idea was ditched in 2022 to focus on making it a solely PC VR headset instead. VR1 uses the same 2880×2880 QD-LCD w/ Mini-LED panels used in Pimax Crystal. The displays have 20000:1 contrast via local dimming, 100% NTSC color gamut, and support 72Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz refresh rate, with an "experimental" 144Hz mode available too. The output brightness to your eyes is 210 nits, around double that of Meta Quest 3 and Apple Vision Pro. Those displays are paired with large dual-element aspheric lenses Somnium claims deliver a field of view of around 130° horizontal and 105° vertical. That's wider than any other VR headset on the market. Pimax "5K" and "8K" were even wider, but are no longer in production and had significant distortion in the periphery. This focus on expanding field of view is why Somnium VR1 is so bulky in an era of far slimmer pancake lens headsets. Somnium says the price increases are due to production being "far more complex than initially anticipated". Specifically, the company is experiencing quality yield issues with its displays and lenses, requiring complex QA and rejecting some component stock. As for new VR1 orders placed today, Somnium says those will take one to two months to ship, and that it is "trying to accelerate production as fast as we can to meet the demand". Later this year, it plans to start selling spare parts for Somnium VR1 to enable self-repairs. We went hands-on with Somnium VR1 back in July.

Title: US stocks notch first weekly gain this year before Trump's inauguration, executive orders

Wall Street closed higher on Friday, pushing stocks to their first weekly advance this year, ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. President-elect Trump's inauguration is Monday, and his first days are expected to be filled with a flurry of executive orders. "Reports suggest 100 or more," wrote Morgan Stanley analysts in a report. Any signals of how Trump's proposed tariffs would be implemented would be carefully watched, they said. Morgan Stanley economists still think the Federal Reserve could lower interest rates at its March policy meeting after cooler inflation data earlier this week, but noted "sooner and higher-than-expected tariffs can take March off of the table." Bitcoin gained 4.95%, closing in on $105,000, in anticipation of a possible first day order by Trump. It was last at $104,949 on reports that Trump could release an executive order making crypto a national priority as soon as his new term begins. Crypto-related shares like Coinbase and Robinhood rose, too." The broad S&P 500 index closed up 1% at 5,996.71; the blue-chip Dow gained 0,77%, rising to 43,487.52; and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 1.51% to 19,630.20. Shares of social media giants Facebook and Instagram owner Meta and YouTube parent Alphabet advanced after the Supreme Court upheld a law that could ban TikTok if its Chinese parent company doesn't sell it. Trump reportedly is considering an executive order to stop the ban. Meanwhile, Meta and Alphabet closed higher because they may be among the companies that could benefit from a TikTok ban, analysts said. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield firmed to 4.615%. U.S. stocks notched their first weekly gain this year, with the S&P 500 and Dow logging their biggest weekly gains since November. The Nasdaq put in its best week since December. "The U.S. macro backdrop at the moment, at least per December’s data, is one that points to the ‘best of all worlds’ – higher employment, falling core inflation (which excludes the volatile food and energy sectors), and a strong consumer," said Michael Brown, senior research strategist at Pepperstone, which offers trading services. "Not a bad inheritance for President-elect Trump to pick up on Monday." On Friday morning, December industrial production and capacity utilization both easily beat expectations. Industrial production, which measures factory output, rose 0.9% and capacity utilization, which measures how efficiently resources are used, improved to 77.6%. On a technical basis, stocks also look bullish, said Larry Tentarelli, chief technical strategist for Blue Chip Daily Trend Report. So-called sentiment indicators -- bullish or bearish -- at extreme levels are "fairly reliable contrarian indicators," Tentarelli said, and bullish sentiment for stocks currently is at the lowest level since the November 2023 major S&P 500 lows in November 2023. This should bode well for stocks, he said. "Investors tend to be most bullish at market highs and most bearish near market lows," he said. Corporate news continues to garner attention.

Title: LVMH's Bernard Arnault ousts Larry Ellison as the world's 4th-richest person after gaining $15 billion in one day

A fashion mogul has gained more wealth this year than Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, or anyone else on the global rich list. Bernard Arnault, the founder and CEO of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, has become about $14 billion richer already in 2025, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He leapfrogged Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison on Thursday to take fourth place on Bloomberg's rich list with an estimated $190 billion fortune, adding $15 billion to his net worth in just one day. The luxury tycoon has gained more wealth this year than Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who was up nearly $12 billion at Thursday's market close, and the "Donald of Dubai" Hussain Sajwani, up around $10 billion. Zuckerberg and Musk are the next-biggest gainers. The Meta and Tesla CEOs have added around $9 billion and $7 billion to their respective fortunes in just over two weeks, respectively. Arnault's net worth soared on Thursday as LVMH stock surged 9% to close at its highest price since September. Arnault owns about 48% of the luxury conglomerate, which houses around 75 brands, including Tiffany & Co, Dom Perignon, and Sephora. The shares jumped on hopes of a rebound in luxury demand after rival Richemont — the owner of brands like Cartier and Chloé — reported record quarterly sales with around 20% growth across Europe, the Americas, Japan, and the Middle East and Africa. Consumer appetite for pricey products came roaring back after the pandemic as people resumed traveling and shopping again. But the luxury business has struggled more recently as brisk inflation, higher interest rates, and economic fears have dampened demand even among well-heeled buyers. Arnault, nicknamed the "Wolf in Cashmere," was ranked as the world's richest person last March with a $230 billion-plus fortune, but his net worth shrank by over $50 billion by December as LVMH stock tumbled. Despite his latest gains, Arnault is still less than half as wealthy as Musk, worth $439 billion. Even accounting for Arnault's wealth decline, the world's 10 richest people added more than $500 billion to their combined fortunes in 2024, boosting their total worth to over $2 trillion. The group benefited from the buzz around artificial intelligence, the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts, an improved US economic outlook, and hopes that Donald Trump's planned tax cuts and deregulation as president will boost corporate profits.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks jumped on Friday amid a tech stock revival as investors assessed a week of key data and earnings reports alongside potential policy shifts under a Trump administration. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks posted big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. The Dow finished up 3.7 for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Housing starts climbed faster than forecast in December, and US industrial production outstripped estimates. The data out Friday added to a picture of strength in the US economy, buoying rate optimism. Meanwhile, techs were staging a comeback, with Apple (AAPL) stock up 0.7% in afternoon trading after booking its worst loss since August. Chipmakers such as Micron (MU) joined Nvidia in making gains, while Coinbase (COIN) was among crypto-linked names getting a boost as bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued its advance above $100,000. Minds are also on potential policy upheaval on the last day of trading before Donald Trump begins his second term as president. Fears are that his plans for tariffs, taxes, and debt — as aired by Treasury pick Scott Bessent on Thursday — could inflame inflation. Inauguration day is Monday, when markets will be closed to mark the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday. China's economy, an adversary for Trump, grew more than expected last year, topping Beijing's 5% target after a stimulus blitz. But Asia stocks lost ground on Friday as investors weigh the potential hit from promised hefty tariffs. The major gauges rallied on Friday and for the week, led by a tech stock resurgence and a shifting mood on Wall Street ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.8% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 1.5% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares were among the biggest players to shift back into the green. The Dow finished up 3.7% for the week. The S&P recorded a 2.9% gain, while the Nasdaq closed 2.4% ahead of last week. Markets have turned upbeat as investors have celebrated earnings from big banks and absord fresh inflation readings that signal the Fed continues to make progress in curbing pricing pressures, resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts in the months ahed After the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, Wall Street will kickstart a whole new era as Trump ascends to the White House for the second time. Market sentiment has improved from a sour mood in recent weeks, instead clinging to a rosier interest rate outlook, muscular corporate earnings, and the expected policy changes that President-elect Trump hopes will lead to a cycle of growth for the US economy. A raft of corporate results will fill up the calendar next week, with big names like Netflix (NFLX), American Express (AXP), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set to report. Major airlines are also on deck. On the data front, a gauge of future US economic activity is set to be released on Wednesday, with the end of the week brining a fresh reading on consumer sentiment. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: The Tesla (TSLA) trade continues to reflect the ambitions and the passionate following of its singular CEO, Elon Musk. Tesla shares jumped roughly 6% Friday amid speculation that Musk could potentially buy TikTok. The short-form video app that has amassed a huge following in the US needs to find an American buyer, or it will effectively face a nationwide ban starting next week. “We believe ByteDance and ultimately Beijing is looking at the possibility that Musk/X could buy the US TikTok operations,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a note to investors. Tesla is also enjoying a broader rally in part thanks to Musk's alliance with President-elect Trump, who could potentially accelerate the EV company's plans to launch a fleet of robotaxis. Musk also co-leads a quasi-governmental position that aims to cut federal spending, which could also favor Musk's aspirations. Tesla's share price has surged around 75% since Election Day. The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Friday that the investment adviser Vanguard will pay more than $100 million to settle charges for misleading statements related to its target-date retirement funds. The charges stem from a decision in late 2020 by Vanguard to lower the minimum initial investment for its institutional target retirement funds. After a substantial number of retirement plan investors switched from their investor plans to to the institutional plans, underlying assets had to be sold to meet the demand for theese redemptions. Retail investors who did not switch into the institutional target funds were hit with "historically larger capital gains distributions and tax liabilities and were deprived of the potential compounding growth of their investments," according to the SEC. Vanguard told Yahoo Finance in a statement that it is pleased to have reached this settlement. The settlement amount will be distributed to harmed investors, the SEC said. Bitcoin bulls are back in control Friday as the price of the dominant cryptocurrency shot above $100,000 and investors anticipated further action from President-elect Donald Trump to support the industry. Trump is expected to release an executive order prioritizing crypto policy during his early days in office, according to reports, as well as appoint business-friendly officials to oversee digital currency's continued rollout into the broader economy. In addition to cryptocurrencies rising in value, several corporate players tied to the ecosystem are rallying off the news. Coinbase (COIN), the nation's largest crypto trading platform, rose 5% Friday. MicroStrategy (MSTR), which continues to invest heavily in bitcoin, gained 7%. Trump has also expressed interest in creating a US crypto reserve, appointing a crypto czar, and implementing other regulations to drive adoption. The pro-growth approach contrasts with what was widely seen as an antagonistic relationship between the Biden administration and the crypto industry. The final trading day of the Biden era is heading for muscular gains Friday as optimism over President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, and the policy changes that will follow, conicide with impressive corporate earnings and a rosier interest rate outlook. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 1.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1.2%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.7% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday. And the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to trade around 4.6% on Friday. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during morning trading on Friday. META (META): Shares of the social media platform rose more than half a percent Friday morning following a decision from the US Supreme Court upholding the law that could see its rival, short-form video app TikTok, banned in the US. The TikTok ban would become effective this Sunday, Jan. 19, unless Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance divests from the platform. Novo Nordisk (NVO): The pharmaceutical company came under pressure after some of its medications were included in a list of Medicare price negotiations in 2027. Novo Nordisk's (NVO) GLP-1 weight-loss drugs, Ozempic and Wegovy, were among the names. Shares fell more than 4%. Intel (INTC): Shares of the embattled technology giant surged 8% Friday afternoon as speculation circulated online that the company has become an acquisition target, based on a report from SemiAccurate Friday. Intel stock has lost more than half its value over the past year. Coinbase (COIN): The nation's largest crypto platform is being buoyed once again by surging bitcoin prices. The price of bitcoin (BTC-USD) topped $100,000 again Friday following reports that President-elect Donald Trump is planning to release an executive order elevating crypto as a policy priority. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released its second round of drug negotiation targets, a list of 15 drugs under Medicare Part D, including Novo Nordisk's (NVO) blockbuster GLP-1s, reports Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani. Novo was trading down 4% on the news Friday. Diabetes drug Ozempic and weight-loss drug Wegovy top the list, along with a number of others like Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Janumet. Read more about the next round of drug price negotiations here. It is unclear if the incoming Trump administration will honor this list and the process or change it after taking office Jan. 20. Novo Nordisk currently has 55% of the GLP-1 market and has raked in $50 billion from the two drugs last year in the first three quarters alone. The US Supreme Court has upheld a law that bans TikTok in the US from Sunday unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, report Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan and Daniel Howley. The ruling on Friday creates new uncertainty for the Chinese app used by 170 million Americans, but could be a long-term boon for social-media rivals for ad dollars like Meta (META). The court sided with the US government’s argument that ties between TikTok’s parent ByteDance and Beijing presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold. TikTok had argued it was entitled to First Amendment protections and that its proprietary algorithm was in fact an editorial expression that qualified as speech. The court's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of Donald Trump, who promised to "save TikTok" and had asked the court to suspend the divestment deadline. The president-elect takes office on Jan. 20, a day after the ban goes into effect. Read more here. A tech stock revival drove a jump on Wall Street Friday as investors took in a week of favorable inflation readings and impressive corporate earnings, shifting market sentiment back toward optimism as the Federal Reserve considers its rate-setting policy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 1%, coming off a losing day for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on over 1.6% as Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) shares nudged back into the green. Markets have turned upbeat as investors take stock of recent days' big bank earnings and inflation readings, which have resuscitated bets on interest-rate cuts. Stocks are on track for big weekly wins after a major rally on Wednesday, while the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) pulled back to 4.6% on Friday. Housing starts rose in December, buoyed by a pickup in multifamily construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed that housing jumped 15.8% in December to an annual rate of 1.49 million, which was higher than economists' expectations for an annual rate of 1.32 million. Single-family starts had a modest advance. Construction rose 3.3% to an annualized rate of 1.05 million, the strongest pace since February 2024. Meanwhile, construction for multifamily dwellings grew by nearly 62%. “Housing starts soared at the end of the year, but this does not mean the country is out of the woods when it comes to the problems in the residential housing sector,” Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at FWDBONDS, wrote after the release. “There still is not enough housing in the country, and the construction of residential homes remains historically depressed,” the economist added. To this point, new construction in 2024 was the slowest it has been since 2019, per Bloomberg. Despite the rise in construction, builders are dealing with elevated mortgage rates. Freddie Mac said mortgage rates increased to 7.04% this week, hitting the highest since May 2024. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which had been climbing higher following strong employment data.

Title: Americans keep swiping: Users scramble onto rival apps before TikTok's sell-or-ban deadline

Happy Friday! Not a great way to start the weekend, but important nonetheless: A new report detailed the alarming rise in cancer among women under 65. While breast cancer remains the biggest risk, lung cancer cases are on the rise. In today's big story, time is running out for TikTok as its sell-or-ban deadline is just days away. What's on deck Markets: When it comes to your 2025 investing strategy, size shouldn't matter. Tech: Meta's aggressive approach to underperformers is a nod to Amazon's playbook. Business: Streamlining. Rightsizing. Reduction of force. Companies are using confusing language to disguise job cuts. But first, we can't keep swiping. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. TikTok's For You Page might soon be for no one. The social media platform is days away from a shutdown in the US thanks to a divest-or-ban law passed back in April. Or is it? To quickly recap: A law requires ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, to sell its US operations to a non-Chinese owner by Sunday. However, anything beyond the above statement is unclear, as Business Insider's Peter Kafka explains. There is some murkiness and conflicting reports on everything from how the law will be enforced to what will happen to TikTok if it isn't sold and the app's potential workarounds. Peter broke down all the possible scenarios. Two central figures in the TikTok saga are the Supreme Court and President-elect Donald Trump. With the former, TikTok argued the law violates the First Amendment. (Give me mindless day-in-the-life videos, or give me death.) However, legal experts told BI the app's argument might not have been good enough to get the highest court in the land to step in. Then there's Trump. Despite having once backed a TikTok ban, the incoming president has done a 180. He's now much more supportive of the app, even inviting CEO Shou Chew to attend his inauguration. Some Democratic lawmakers are cheering Trump on regarding his TikTok efforts. But as Peter points out, there are still questions about what Trump could do, even as president, to prevent the ban. In the meantime, the world keeps swiping. One way or another. Americans are proving stubborn, resourceful, or a combination of both as they look to scratch their social-media itch. RedNote, which is basically China's version of Instagram, is surging in popularity in the US. The irony is Americans are essentially thumbing their nose at the US government by jumping to another Chinese-owned app, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. RedNote has become so popular that Duolingo told BI it's seen 216% growth in new Mandarin learners in the US. If TikTok truly is gone for good starting Sunday, there could be more US winners as users continue to look for a new home. And wherever the self-anointed "TikTok refugees" land, the ad dollars could follow. Some familiar names could just gobble back up more business, according to Wall Street analysts, but emerging platforms like Reddit and Trade Desk might also stand to benefit, writes BI's Kelly Cloonan. As for content creators who have built businesses on TikTok, it's another lesson in the importance of diversification. 1. America's economic exceptionalism isn't going anywhere. If you're wondering whether US market dominance peaked in 2024 — when US GDP neared $30 trillion and dwarfed both the Eurozone and China — the answer is no. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs both urged investors to bet on the red, white, and blue this year. 2. Dutch Bros, Tempur-Sealy, and Mattel make the cut. UBS made its case for small and mid caps, with analysts pointing out how smaller firms outdid their larger peers by 2% per year in the long term. Interest-rate cuts aren't on the forecast after last month's knockout jobs report, but UBS still had some top picks for smaller stocks to buy. 3. Six shocks that could shake up markets in 2025. It's hard to predict surprises, but that doesn't stop some strategists from trying. From a global internet outage to another year of 20% stock gains, here are the curveballs Bank of America thinks could rattle investors. 1. The Musk-Bezos space race. Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin successfully sent its New Glenn rocket into orbit on Thursday. Its competitor SpaceX ran its seventh Starship launch later that day, but the mega-rocket unexpectedly dropped out of communications and exploded after liftoff. Pressure is mounting on both Bezos and Musk, as they prepare for Trump's White House return. 2. Amazon's RTO headaches. The company's five-day return-to-office mandate is off to a bumpy start thanks to a shortage of office space. Some employees told BI the rollout was riddled with issues like a lack of desks and meeting rooms, and workplace theft. Plus, they're still on video chats. 3. The times, they are a-changin' — and Big Tech workers pay the price. Meta and Microsoft are embracing Amazon's brutal management style, prioritizing lean, high-performing teams over employee retention. "The overarching trend is that corporations feel they have more power over their employees," one former Googler told BI. 1. Nonregrettable attrition (noun): a euphemistic term for layoffs. Many companies go out of their way to avoid calling job cuts what they are. But whether it's "rightsizing," "streamlining," or Meta's recent buzzphrase "nonregrettable attrition," the corporate lingo of job cuts doesn't soften the blow to employees. 2. Justin Baldoni sues Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, claiming $400 million in damages. The "It Ends With Us" director filed a 179-page suit on Thursday, accusing his costar of hijacking the movie and destroying his reputation. Lively previously accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and of trying to smear her in the press, claims that Baldoni has denied. 3. All the lonely (young) people. Gen Z adults are the loneliest and least optimistic generation, a new survey found. It's not just about young Americans having fewer social connections. More time alone and young people getting married later are also factors. Boomers, on the other hand, are on a different wavelength. The 10 safest states to live in the US, ranked.

Title: The Power Of Leadership Magnetism: A Key Driver Of Stock Performance

Louis Carter: CEO of Best Practice Institute, creator of Most Loved Workplace®, author of Change Champions & In Great Company (McGraw Hill). When discussing drivers of stock performance, many factors come to mind—market conditions, financial performance and strategic communications, among others. However, even the most compelling good news doesn't always translate to stock price increases. A crucial yet often overlooked factor is what I call "leadership magnetism": the ability of a leader to build trust, emotional alignment and shared purpose with their stakeholders. Leadership magnetism refers to the gravitational pull a leader creates through their actions, behaviors and communications. It isn't about charisma or personality—it's about building authentic connections that attract, align and inspire stakeholders, from employees to investors. Leaders with strong magnetism can amplify the impact of strategic announcements, driving enthusiasm and financial returns. When leadership magnetism is weak, however, even breakthrough announcements can fail to move markets, as eroded trust dampens investor response. Research underscores the value of leadership magnetism in organizational success. A Weber Shandwick study found that executives attribute 44% of a company's market value to the CEO's reputation. Similarly, back in 2000, a Burson-Marsteller study revealed that 45% of a company's reputation directly stems from its CEO’s standing. These findings highlight how a leader’s ability to connect emotionally and strategically with stakeholders significantly influences market outcomes. Several notable cases demonstrate how weak leadership magnetism can undermine even the most promising strategic initiatives: • WeWork's Trajectory Under Adam Neumann: Despite announcing ambitious expansion plans in 2019, WeWork's valuation plummeted from $47 billion to less than $8 billion (subscription required). As documented by the Wall Street Journal, stakeholders lost confidence in Adam Neumann's leadership due to concerns about his decision-making and governance style. Bloomberg similarly detailed how mounting concerns about Neumann's transparency eroded investor confidence​ • Meta And Mark Zuckerberg's Metaverse Investment: In October 2021, Mark Zuckerberg announced a $10 billion investment in the metaverse alongside a company rebranding. However, Meta's stock price dropped, as ongoing privacy issues and ethical controversies diminished his leadership magnetism. • GE's Strategic Pivot Under Jeff Immelt: Between 2015 and 2017, GE's stock price declined from $30.66 to $23.16 as stakeholders questioned Jeff Immelt's ability to execute a digital transformation strategy. CEOs who master leadership magnetism can transform strategic announcements into powerful market catalysts: • Microsoft And Satya Nadella: Satya Nadella’s clear vision for AI-driven growth has been instrumental in Microsoft’s financial success. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft reported in 2024 "over $245 billion in annual revenue, marking a 16% increase year-over-year, alongside a 24% jump in operating income to over $109 billion." These achievements underscore Nadella’s ability to inspire confidence and effectively communicate strategic priorities. • Tesla And Elon Musk: Elon Musk’s ability to rally stakeholders around Tesla’s mission "to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy" exemplifies leadership magnetism. Musk’s authenticity and mission-driven strategy have been credited as key factors in Tesla’s rise to market dominance, inspiring investor confidence and stakeholder loyalty (membership required). After two and a half decades working alongside, coaching and advising CEOs, I've observed three fundamental practices that build and sustain leadership magnetism: Leadership magnetism thrives when leaders tune into their organization's pulse, strengthen it and then move on it. Magnetic leaders have an innate sense of when to listen and when to move—gathering key insights swiftly, recognizing patterns that matter and then driving consistent messages that reflect shared aspirations. Take Satya Nadella, whose leadership at Microsoft exemplifies this approach, bringing teams into the vision-building process and ensuring alignment and commitment. Magnetic leaders use stakeholder feedback as their strategic radar, not a compliance exercise. Lisa Su of AMD demonstrates this perfectly: She consistently gathers input from employees and retail investors, using it to refine AMD's strategy and foster loyalty. Elon Musk has a rare quality among CEOs: He doesn't sugarcoat things, even in tough moments. Take his 2014 interview where he opened up about Tesla's early days. Instead of spinning a success story, he admitted what was really going through his head at the time: "I thought we would most likely fail." You don't often hear billionaire founders talk about doubt like that. It's this kind of raw honesty, especially when the stakes are high, that sets his leadership style apart. Leadership magnetism is not a fixed trait—it’s a skill that can be cultivated through intentional practices. By fostering collaboration, integrating feedback and acting authentically, leaders can create a magnetic pull that inspires, aligns and drives success. As markets grow more complex and stakeholder expectations evolve, leadership magnetism will become increasingly crucial. Tomorrow's successful leaders must master the delicate balance between strategic vision and authentic connection, technical excellence and emotional intelligence, bold action and stakeholder trust. The revolution in leadership valuation is already underway. Good news alone won't drive stock price increases if stakeholders don't trust or admire the CEO. Those who embrace the power of leadership magnetism will be best positioned to thrive in this new era of market dynamics.

Title: Microsoft’s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? The worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple. “The market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,” said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While “Microsoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.” The stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally. This reflects scrutiny on the firm’s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft’s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers. The next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one. Slower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. “Google Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot” or other services, according to Wedbush’s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft’s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini. Microsoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this “might be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.” On Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools. Even if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp. Bank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the “best positioned” for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications. Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook. “While AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,” she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. “Strong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.” Revenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years. The question is whether that’s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25. “AI adoption is the question on everyone’s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,” said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. “Some traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.” Tech Chart of the Day Apple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday. Top Tech Stories TikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX’s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle’s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.

Title: How blowout bank earnings and a promising inflation report gave the market a much-needed boost

Time Published: 2025-01-16T14:14:52Z

Hello there! A product going viral can be a double-edged sword for retailers. Just ask Walmart. The big-box store's e-commerce marketplace got a boost from an imitation Hermès' Birkin bag making the rounds, but dupes also cause headaches for brand relationships. In today's big story, US banks' impressive earnings and a hopeful inflation report have stocks back on the rise. What's on deck Markets: Anthony Scaramucci offers some economic predictions for Trump's second term. Tech: The VC world is starting to heal as Insight Partners raises a massive new fund. Business: Billionaires are booked and busy next week thanks to a scheduling conflict between the inauguration and Davos. But first, we're so back. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. It's alive! After a slow start to the year, the stock market finally showed signs of life thanks to blowout bank earnings and better-than-expected inflation data. The S&P 500 finished Wednesday up 1.83%, while the Dow (1.65%) and tech-heavy Nasdaq composite (2.45%) posted strong days. Let's start with Wall Street. Big US banks represent the unofficial kickoff to earnings season, and they didn't disappoint. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Wells Fargo all beat analysts expectations. JPMorgan saw a 50% year-over-year increase in profits for the fourth quarter while Goldman's profits jumped an incredible 105%. The banking boom was largely driven by classic Wall Street businesses like corporate dealmaking, capital raising, and trading. December's inflation report also put extra wind in the market's sails. At first glance — inflation rose for the third straight month — the reading might not seem great. But a closer look showed the consumer price index's year-over-year increase matched consensus expectations, which is good. What's even better, though, is core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was slightly below expectations. It also came in lower than November's number. Before you get ahead of yourself, don't expect a slew of rate cuts. Instead, the data calmed investors' nerves by slowing the troubling rise of the 10-year Treasury yield, which dropped 0.14%. "Core Inflation isn't accelerating and that's the story. The market may have had its hair on fire about inflation running away again, but the data do not support that conclusion," said Jamie Cox, Managing Partner for Harris Financial Group. So what's next for Wall Street? In the short term, bankers might finally enjoy some healthy bonuses after a few slim years. Workers are starting to find out about their year-end comp. Bigger picture, it's more momentum for the industry's job market. After a lull in activity, firms are bolstering their ranks across the board for what appears to be an active 2025. The private markets are one area that'll remain in the spotlight. The sector, which includes less-liquid investments like private equity and private credit that come with higher fees, is of particular interest to BlackRock. The $11.6 trillion asset manager sees it as the key to its next stage of evolution, according to CEO Larry Fink. One evolution Fink didn't discuss was who will take over when he's gone. That's despite the recent departure of executive Mark Wiedman, which reignited questions about what life after Larry will look like at BlackRock. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon was a little bit more forthcoming with his own retirement plans … sort of. When asked by an analyst who his successor was, Dimon said there are a number of great candidates, but a decision hasn't been made. And even if the bank did have someone in mind, there's no guarantee things won't change, Dimon added. 1. One of Trump's opps is feeling good about the economy. Despite being a longtime Trump critic, Anthony Scaramucci is pretty optimistic about the economy under the incoming 47th president. He sees Trump's pro-growth policies and potential crypto legislation as an economic boon — but he's still concerned about some of Trump's other promises. 2. Hindenburg Research is tapping out. Nate Anderson, founder of the short-selling firm, said he's disbanding it, once they've completed all outstanding projects. Hindenburg gained fame for its forensic financial research, often focusing on what it argued to be fraudulent or misleading corporate behavior. Anderson said he plans to share the firm's investigation tactics publicly. 3. Dividend stocks are so back. Large-cap stocks have dominated the market, but a change could be coming, according to Morningstar. As their valuations continue to climb, dividend stocks might become more palatable. Morningstar highlighted dividend stocks in four specific sectors savvy investors should pay attention to. 1. Mark Zuckerberg lost $60 billion in five years — and he's going to keep spending. Despite persistent predictions that the VR and AR headset market will boom, consumers just aren't interested. Meta lost big on the tech in the last few years, but that hasn't deterred Zuck, who keeps telling investors they should expect more losses in the future. 2. Exclusive: Insight Partners raises $12.5 billion for its newest set of funds. It's the largest sum raised by a venture capital firm in over two years, according to PitchBook data. Insight's $12.5 billion may be less than its initial funding goal, but it's still an impressive get as the industry looks to mount a comeback. 3. "TikTok refugees" flock to Chinese app RedNote. While some Americans are coping with a possible TikTok ban through memes, competitors like Texas-based app Clapper are seizing the moment. Other Americans are heading to the Chinese app Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. It might be worth learning how to use it — but some members of Congress are already taking aim. 1. WFH + Fridays = OOO. For some remote workers, the W in WFH Friday is a bit of a stretch. They're turning every weekend into a three-day weekend, and they don't feel particularly bad about it, either. 2. Home Depot cofounders were investigated by the FBI in the '70s and '80s, new public records show. The FBI was investigating Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank over claims they used a slush fund in an attempt to bribe California Handy Dan employees to decertify their union, newly obtained records show. The investigation ended in 1983 when a prosecutor determined the case was too old and evidence was "insufficient." 3. Double-booked billionaires. January 20 is not only Trump's inauguration but also the first day of the World Economic Forum's high-profile conference in Davos, Switzerland. Conflicted guests will have to choose between missing potential face time with the new president or a day of brushing shoulders with the global elite. Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi won't be missing out on Trump's big day. Boeing's dismal 2024 deliveries show just how much of a challenge CEO Kelly Ortberg faces. UnitedHealth Group, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley report earnings.

Title: Forbes Daily: Biden Takes Aim At Big Tech In Final Days As President

Plus: The use of AI kissing apps and their promotion on social media including Meta and TikTok have some experts concerned about the lack of consent involved and the continued rise of deepfakes. Good morning, Corporate training videos can be dull. But one British startup is betting it can use AI to change that. Synthesia’s AI avatars are already used by companies like Xerox, Spirit Airlines and chemicals giant DuPont to convert training text into videos in over 20 languages—with just one click. Synthesia just raised $180 million, valuing it at $2.1 billion, to make its avatars more lifelike and invest in tools for creating and hosting videos. Eventually, the company could compete with giants like OpenAI’s Sora or AI video startup Runway. But Synthesia’s lucrative niche making human proxies means its customers are more likely to be HR teams rather than Hollywood directors. President Joe Biden speaks about the Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage release deal as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken look on. Israel and Gaza-based militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire deal Wednesday after more than 15 months of fighting and just days before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. President Joe Biden said in a press conference that American hostages would be released as part of the first phase of the deal, but that all other details of the plan would be forthcoming. Officials believe 98 hostages remain in Gaza and that about 60 are still alive, per the Washington Post. If ByteDance were to sell TikTok to avoid an impending ban in the U.S. (which it has indicated it has no plans to do), how much would it be worth? Frank McCourt, the former Los Angeles Dodgers owner leading a group bidding for the social media giant, thinks TikTok’s U.S. business is worth $20 billion without its powerful “recommendation engine” which suggests new videos. But with the prized algorithm, one analyst thinks that a price of $300 billion “could be conservative.” MORE: Trump is considering ways to prevent TikTok’s potential ban, including a possible executive order, according to the Washington Post. Meanwhile, the social media company’s CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the president-elect’s inauguration next week, with the New York Times reporting that he was formally invited by the inaugural committee. Inflation is still not back to the pre-pandemic norm. Inflation reached its highest level since the summer in December, at 2.9% year-over-year, though it was in line with economists’ projections. The higher inflation reading was at least in part a reflection of price increases tied to the turn of the calendar year, according to two Goldman Sachs economists. But core CPI inflation, which excludes food and energy price changes, was 3.2%, better than consensus estimates. MORE: Markets responded strongly to the report, the first inflation reading of the year, as the S&P 500 ended up 1.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.65% and the Nasdaq surged 2.45%, their best days since November 6. Still, one strategist warned the market’s recent fickle nature should keep investors on their toes. Payments startup Bolt’s $450 million raise is on ice after investors sued to block the round, but one Bolt shareholder has managed to escape the turmoil. Delaware’s Court of the Chancery ruled in a December 16 hearing that Bolt investor Activant Capital could sell $37 million of its shares back to the startup, ending a legal dispute that began in July 2023. The Blue Origin New Glenn rocket lifts off Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Jeff Bezos’ space company Blue Origin successfully launched its New Glenn heavy lift rocket into orbit early Thursday—though it failed to meet a secondary goal of recovering a reusable booster stage of the rocket, which was lost during reentry. Still, the launch helps Blue Origin notch a key milestone as it aims to compete with Elon Musk’s SpaceX. Three-year-old startup Saronic, which aims to make a fleet of autonomous boats for the U.S. Navy, is in talks to raise $500 million, Forbes has learned. The fundraising round would value the nascent company at over $3 billion, the latest signal of booming venture capital interest in defense tech. In his farewell address Wednesday night, President Joe Biden warned Americans about what he called an oligarchy “of extreme wealth, power and influence” taking root in the U.S. The president also took aim at Big Tech, saying that he was “concerned about the potential rise of a tech-industrial complex,” while calling for more safeguards on powerful AI technologies. President-elect Donald Trump hosted 22 of the nation’s 27 Republican governors at a dinner at Mar-a-Lago last week. All these visitors, including dozens of other political powerbrokers, will likely boost Mar-a-Lago’s bottom line: Profits at the club have already more than doubled since the end of Trump’s first term. Drake sued Universal Music Group, which represents both himself and rapper Kendrick Lamar, accusing the major music company of defamation for releasing and promoting Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Drake’s lawsuit claims that UMG—but not Lamar—falsely promoted the ideas that Drake has committed acts of pedophilia and sex trafficking, which the rapper denies. The delays at the heart of the lawsuit date back to 2022. The Transportation Department sued Southwest Airlines over “chronically delayed flights,” its latest action after fining JetBlue Airways over the same issue earlier this month. The lawsuit alleges Southwest flights from Chicago to Oakland and from Baltimore to Cleveland reached their destinations late nearly 200 times in 2022, according to CNBC. Brightline West, a bullet train project from billionaire investor Wes Eden to connect Las Vegas with suburban Los Angeles, is raising $2.5 billion from private investors with a tax-exempt bond offering. The new funding push, along with a $3 billion federal grant and other funds, is intended to help cover the estimated $12.4 billion needed to complete the line. Brightline seeks to launch passenger service by late 2028. As wildfires rage in Southern California, many are asking what they can do to help. Tax-exempt charities accepting wildfire-specific donations include the American Red Cross, the California Fire Foundation, the Los Angeles Food Bank and Direct Relief. Even if you’re not planning to claim a tax deduction, some of the tax rules that apply to charitable donations—like checking to see that the organization you’re giving to has its paperwork in order—are good rules to follow. MORE: Those impacted by the fire may get some relief from the IRS and the tax code, for instance, by taking an early withdrawal from a workplace retirement savings account without the penalty. And individuals and businesses in a federally declared disaster area are entitled to claim casualty loss deductions. ILLUSTRATION BY EMILY SCHERER FOR FORBES; IMAGE BY BORIS SV/GETTY IMAGES TOPLINE Meta and TikTok have run thousands of ads for apps that use AI to generate fake kissing videos of people, allowing users to upload photos of any two people and let AI convert them into a video of them kissing. The apps are being marketed as tools that would allow you to instantly “kiss anyone you want”—no consent required. Similar in concept to “AI nudifier” apps that produce nonconsensual deepfake pornography, these AI kissing apps create believable videos of people doing something they didn’t do. And the ease at which they do it is a concerning habitualization of deepfake imagery. While the ads are not sexually explicit like the deluge of AI-generated pornographic content that has engulfed social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit and YouTube, they can be equally dangerous, Haley McNamara, an executive at the National Center for Sexual Exploitation told Forbes. The companies behind these video generators appear to be based outside the U.S. in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Italy and China, according to their websites. The apps are available for free on Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store and already have millions of downloads. The spread of AI kissing apps, boosted by social media’s virality, illustrate a troubling mainstreaming of deepfakes in the age of generative AI. Use of these seemingly harmless apps could open the door to tools that could create more graphic imagery like deepfake porn and other types of image-based sexual abuse, McNamara said. “It’s just an absolute Pandora’s box,” she said. WHY IT MATTERS “The rise of an ‘AI kissing trend’ on social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok represents the mainstreaming of deepfakes at a time when AI tools are being used to create nonconsensual pornographic deepfakes,” says Forbes reporter Rashi Shrivastava. “As is the case with AI image generators like Stable Diffusion, such systems can be misused to create videos of someone without their consent, and bully or harass them.” MORE Almost Half The Girls At This School Were Targets Of AI Porn. Their Ex-Classmates Have Now Been Indicted. Apple and Google have delisted apps developed by the Huione Group, a Cambodian company accused on Tuesday of running the biggest dark web market of all time: As much as $24 billion: The amount of sales that have gone through the Huione Guarantee platform, according to crypto crime tracker Elliptic $5 billion: The amount of sales on the next most lucrative illegal bazaar, Hydra ‘The largest illicit online marketplace to have ever operated’: Elliptic said of Huione’s Telegram-based platform Finally receiving a job offer after a lengthy search feels like a huge weight lifted, but the next step, salary negotiation, requires careful navigation. First, research industry-specific salary ranges, and consider other forms of compensation, like stock options, health benefits and bonus structures. Try to strike a balance between being assertive and diplomatic. If a company provides a lowball offer, counter with a well-researched figure that reflects your true worth. As a potential TikTok ban looms, some users are flocking to one of China’s most popular social media apps. Which app is it? A. WeChat B. Weibo C. RedNote D. Tencent QQ Check your answer.

Title: NetApp sells Spot and CloudCheckr to cloud cost control company Flexera

UPDATED 20:50 EST / JANUARY 15 2025 by Mike Wheatley NetApp Inc. is selling a portfolio of its software assets to the cloud cost management specialist Flexera Software LLC. Today’s announcement revealed that Flexera will acquire parts of NetApp’s Spot by NetApp and CloudCheckr products in a deal. The financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but it’s valued at about $100 million, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Bloomberg noted that the sale likely follows a decision by NetApp to streamline its business and double down on its core operations, in line with a wider industry trend. It added that global asset sales increased by 26% in 2024, rising to almost $555 billion. Spot and CloudCheckr’s tools are used by companies to keep track of the cost of using different cloud computing services. In the case of Spot, it provides continuous automation, optimization and insights around customer’s cloud infrastructure investments, helping them to maximize their cloud resource usage. NetApp bought Spot in 2020 for an undisclosed price, with reports at the time saying it paid in excess of $450 million. Flexera specializes in cloud service orchestration, policy management and cost optimization tools. As such, managing cloud environments is its core business, which may make it a better fit for Spot. In contrast, NetApp is more focused on providing unified data storage that spans cloud and on-premises data center environments. It has some big ambitions to create an intelligent data infrastructure to support generative AI workloads. In addition, it also sells data center hardware based on all-flash storage systems. NAND Research Inc. analyst Steve McDowell told SiliconANGLE that when NetApp acquired Spot almost five years ago, it was focused on building a cloud operations business. “Since that time, NetApp has refined its cloud strategy and today it’s more focused on bringing ONTAP to the public cloud, and it has been one of the more successful cloud storage stories in the industry,” the analyst said. “NetApp is no longer trying to be in the cloud operations business, so that made Spot an awkward fit.” The only slight downside to the deal for NetApp is the reported price it received for Spot. “We don’t know what NetApp’s revenue from Spot was over the past five years, so it’s impossible to know if it broke even,” McDowell added. “I suspect it didn’t, but the sale is still a much better option than just shutting the business down.” Flexera Chief Executive Jim Ryan said the acquisition of Spot will improve its ability to “tackle the proliferation of hybrid cloud cost and usage challenges across public cloud, data centers, SaaS and even AI.” “Acquiring Spot gives Flexera a stellar set of mature cloud FinOps capabilities that it can quickly deploy to its customers,” McDowell said. “It’s a great acquisition for the company, adding new capabilities that give it a really comprehensive set of features for its customers.” Investors seemed to approve of the sale, with NetApp’s stock closing the day up 1.5%, giving it a market capitalization of about $24 billion. In the last year, its stock has risen 35%. Flexera is a privately held firm that was acquired by the equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC in 2020. TA Associates LLC and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board are also said to hold minority stakes in the company.

Title: The Mediaverse and the Year Ahead

Sign up Sign in Sign up Sign in Peter Himler Follow Adventures in Consumer Technology -- Listen Share And It’s Not All About AI In a recent post on resources for discovering podcasts, I noted that 2025 will be a year when those in the PR profession must reconcile the desire by clients for coverage in legacy media versus the potentially greater impact of a whole new cadre of earned media platforms. In the piece, I wrote: “There is nothing like a prominent Wall Street Journal or New York Times feature, let alone a six-minute segment on NBC “Today” or PBS “NewsHour.” But do these traditional media outlets move the needle as much as a widely followed social media star, top-rated podcast, or heavily subscribed newsletter? Could Joe Rogan have more influence than NPR?” It’s an important question for our times and the PR industry. The growing hegemony of podcasts, newsletters, and Insty, TikTok, and YouTube stars may prove more valuable than the productivity gains from AI and machine learning. A well-timed appearance on a top-rated podcast can have a greater impact than an ephemeral story in a paywalled legacy news outlet, with the last election being a primary example. In her Nieman Lab piece, “Podcasting Becomes the Primary Media Strategy, not an Afterthought,” The Podglomerate’s Joni Deutsch observed: “At a time where traditional media trust continues to hit historic lows, podcasts can help long-standing organizations establish stronger relationships with audiences and, in the process, drive real change in how people think and engage with the news.” For years, The New York Times set the national news agenda. A prominent investigative report or fawning profile could easily lead to a Congressional hearing or the A-list, respectively. And while The Times still sets tongues-a-waggin’, its paywalled content does not travel as far and wide as a top influencer’s social media post or podcast episode. Diminished trust in mainstream media is another barrier, but that’s a topic for a different day. These once-pedestrian content formats are truly ascendant with their ability to ratchet up digital eyeballs and a measurable increase in awareness, product sales, or even stock price. They have legs. It’s no wonder TikTok is doubling down on e-commerce. As for real-time platforms, Twitter once had the unique capacity to create national story memes, in part due to the myriad journalists and (actual) verified users who loitered and amplified on the platform. No longer. An Elon-remade Twitter has X’d into a cesspool of misinformation, conspiracy, and anger, e.g., Thus, many in the fourth estate have abandoned his propaganda machine and migrated to Meta-owned Threads, only to learn that its algorithm suppresses breaking news in favor of titillating content. Strangely, Threads also hinders engagement with others and now, along with its sister platforms Instagram and Facebook, will follow X into the fact-free zone under the guise of free speech. Most recently, BlueSky is enjoying its moment in the sun. Founded, but abandoned by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, this more civil platform has usurped both X and Threads as a safe , real-time resource for journalists. In December, it surpassed 25 million registered users. Don’t ignore it. Here’s a BlueSky post from Julie Brown, the Miami Herald investigative reporter who doggedly broke the Jeffrey Epstein story: Then there are the countless newsletters that regularly arrive in your inbox. They reside on self-publishing platforms like Substack, Beehiiv, or Ghost and often feature the work of prominent journalists, many refugees of big-branded legacy media who’ve forsaken their once high and mighty perches to go it alone. Lester Wunderman, eat your heart out. Some of my favorite newsletters include Casey Newton’s “Platformer,” Jedd Legum’s “Popular Information,” Oliver Darcy’s “Status,” Dan Perry’s “Ask Questions Later,” Taylor Lorenz’s “User Mag,” and any of those emanating from Axios, Puck, Semafor, or The Information. As for AI, make no mistake: we’re witnessing a whirlwind of promising use cases for PR practitioners. They range from analyzing a journalist’s past coverage before an interview to condensing a laboriously long media pitch to its “Smart Brevity”-style essence. Here’s a piece on one AI platform that I’ve found especially beneficial to the clients of my firm. What will not change for PR pros who compete in the earned media relations game is the requirement that they stay informed, inquisitive, and immersed in as much client-relevant content as possible, no matter how it arrives. Finally, as we head into 2025, I’d like to give a shout-out to some of the newer media outlets that have embraced quality journalism. Paramount among them is ProPublica for its essential, First Amendment-protected investigative reporting that holds wrong-doers to account. Happy New Year.

Title: Stock market today: Dow jumps 700 points, Nasdaq soars 2.5% after cool CPI reading

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks ripped higher on Wednesday as high hopes for bank earnings paid off and a crucial consumer inflation update showed key prices increased less than expected in December. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) popped more than 1.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 1.6%, or over 700 points. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared 2.5%. Stocks took a leg higher after the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed progress toward the Fed's 2% inflation target in December. Read more: Stocks look to build on best day of 2025 Prices climbed 0.2% month-on-month on a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, an easing from November's 0.3% gain. Over last year, core CPI rose 3.2%. Until the latest print, annual core CPI had been stuck at a 3.3% gain for the past four months. December was the first time since July that the metric reflected a deceleration in price growth. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dropped over 13 basis points to trade around 4.65% after the cooler-than-expected reading. It had been up at its highest level in more than a year, serving as a headwind for stocks. The interest-rate-sensitive small-cap Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) soared in reaction, rising almost 2%. Traders still see just a 3% chance that the Fed lowers rates in January, per the CME FedWatch Tool. They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June now seen as more likely than not. Read more: What a Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Spirits also got a boost from Wall Street bank earnings reports, which brought surging profits thanks to a dealmaking revival and investment banking strength. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) delivered on optimistic analyst expectations with a second straight year of record profit, while Goldman Sachs (GS) profit beat estimates. BlackRock (BLK), Wells Fargo (WFC) and BNY (BK) also booked bumper quarters. Financials led the sector action on Wednesday as surge in investment banking and trading revenues helped drive well received results for multiple big banks including JPMorgan (JPM) Goldman Sachs (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC). Read more about their results here. Amid a massive stock rally on Wednesday, large cap tech is still a clear leader. All seven of the so-called "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) — were up more than 1.5% or higher. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) is up more than 3.5%, far outpacing the gains in the three major averages. A large drop in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) down to 4.65% has sparked renewed interest in risk assets on Wednesday. But as we've been highlighting, the 10-year's recent surge higher has been driven by a multitude of reasons, not just expectations of higher inflation. And one positive Consumer Price Index report doesn't give the all clear on the recent higher rate headwind for stocks, Wellington Management fixed income portfolio manager Brij Khurana told Yahoo Finance. Khurana said it's "still too early" to call a peak in bond yields for the time being, adding that if the new Trump administration brings more fiscal spending than anticipated, yields could start another move higher. Still, Khurana described Wednesday's market action as a "a welcome reprieve for the bond market." "There are two-way risks to bond yields," Khurana said. "It's not just one way." Wednesday's better-than-expected inflation reading showed one particularly promising sign for the Federal Reserve. The shelter index saw prices increase 4.6% compared to the year prior, the lowest level since January 2022. While the index still remains elevated, one of the sticker parts of the inflation story over the past several years continues to show the progress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has discussed in recent press conferences. "With housing services inflation, which is one that we’ve really worried about, it really has come down now quite steadily, at a slower pace than we thought ... but it’s nonetheless steadily coming down," Powell said on Dec. 18. The additional progress in sticky areas of inflation like housing is why some economists believe interest rate cuts remain on the table in 2025. "The slowdown of the past few months is exactly what [Powell] was talking about, and should give the FOMC more confidence that they can continue to cut rates this year, even if they pause in the short-term," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. Read more on shelter inflation here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) spiked after Wednesday's morning soft inflation reading, to reach just shy of $99,000. The world's largest cryptocurrency following the moves of the broader market has been an emerging trend in recent weeks. Read more on what's recently been driving bitcoin prices from Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolff-Mann here. A reshuffling at JPMorgan (JPM) on Tuesday rose questions about when CEO Jamie Dimon will step down. The bank's leader said Wednesday it likely won't be anytime soon. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Jamie Dimon agreed Wednesday with an analyst's assessment that his "base case" for stepping down as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO is a few years from now. The new comments on succession came one day after the nation’s largest bank announced a management reshuffling that raised new questions about the race to succeed the 68-year-old Dimon, the longest-serving big bank CEO. Read more here. Oil prices jumped on Wednesday as US crude inventories fell for an eighth straight week. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) popped more than 2.5% to trade around $79.50 per barrel while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, spiked 2% to hover above $81. Oil rallied as US inventories fell by 1.96 million barrels last week to their lowest level since April, according to the latest Energy Information Administration data released on Wednesday. Meanwhile gasoline stockpiles hit their highest level in a year. Crude has been on the rise recently after the US announced broad-based sanctions against oil producer Russia in an effort to cut off Moscow's revenue amid the ongoing war in Ukraine. Last Friday, a hotter-than-expected December jobs report spooked the market and introduced a discussion about the Federal Reserve not cutting interest rates at all or possibly hiking interest rates at some point. Largely, economists argued the jobs print intensified the focus on whether inflation will start to show the signs of softening that could prompt the Fed to cut interest rates in 2025. Early evidence of that trend came through in Wednesday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) release. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices rose 3.2% compared with the previous year. This marked the first move lower in core CPI since July. While economists don't believe this data will push the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its January meeting, several do see a path for rate cuts later in 2025. Citi economist Veronica Clark wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday that markets have "overestimated the stickiness of inflation." "Details of December data should also be encouraging for further [Fed] easing, with many components largely as expected and in line with pre-pandemic norms," Clark wrote. "Weaker inflation should give the Fed more confidence that recent acceleration was just a bump," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote. "This print is consistent with our call for a rate cut in March." JPMorgan (JPM) shares traded just above the flat line on Wednesday despite a large profit boost for America's largest bank. Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Last year JPMorgan Chase (JPM) churned out more profits than it ever has before, earning $14 billion in the final quarter of 2024. Its full-year profits rose to $58 billion, an all-time record for JPMorgan and the most ever in the history of American banking. Its fourth quarter profits were up 50% from the year-earlier period. That results were buoyed by a surge in JPMorgan's Wall Street operations as dealmaking makes a comeback across the industry following a two-year drought. JPMorgan's investment banking revenue was up 49% from a year earlier. Read more here. A broad-based rally in stocks took hold at the open of Wednesday's trading session on Wall Street. All 11 sectors were in the green with interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as Real Estate (XLRE) and Utilities (XLU) leading the charge. Five sectors were outperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 1.3% gain. A recent headwind for stocks died away on Wednesday morning. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX), which had been up at its highest level in more than a year, dropped more than 12 basis points to 4.66% following a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation reading. Meanwhile, stocks rallied, with futures tied to the major averages all rising 1.5% or more. Fresh consumer inflation data out Wednesday showed prices increased less than expected in December. The Consumer Price Index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that on a "core" basis — which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas — prices increased 0.2% month-on-month. That was lower than the 0.3% economists had expected. On a yearly basis, core prices increased 3.2%, below the 3.3% economists had projected. It was the first move lower in the metric since July. The headline CPI increased 2.9% over the prior year in December, an uptick from the 2.7% seen in November but in line with economists' expectations. The index rose 0.4% over the previous month, topping the 0.2% increase seen in November and also on par with economists' estimates. Bank earnings kick off the season in earnest, and a Consumer Price Index reading has investors on high alert. Here's a rundown: Economic data: MBA Mortgage Applications (week ending Jan. 10) Consumer Price Index (December); Real average hourly earnings (December) Earnings: BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Synovus (SNV), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: JPMorgan notches another record year of profits Goldman Sachs profit surges as investment banking, trading fuel bumper quarter BlackRock profit jumps as it posts record $641B in client cash Wells Fargo earnings climb as investment banking shines Huang Bump Seen Fading for Nvidia-Linked Stocks Riding AI Rally Wall Street firms predict jolt in US stocks on inflation miss Investors pour billions into S&P equal weight fund as tech fears rise Chip industry groups slam expected rules in private letter to Biden Yours truly is getting ready to head out for another week of impactful reporting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland — which kicks off next Monday. I will have more to say on what we will be doing there in this Sunday's Morning Brief newsletter. I will quickly note that a source familiar with the matter tells me President Trump will be speaking by video feed on Thursday, just days after his inauguration (and perhaps a flurry of executive orders). But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare. Thinking a lot of these risks aren't priced into Mag 7 stocks! "Rising geopolitical tensions and a fracturing of trust are driving the global risk landscape" said WEF managing director Mirek Dušek in a statement. "In this complex and dynamic context, leaders have a choice: to find ways to foster collaboration and resilience, or face compounding vulnerabilities." Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Netflix Signals No Change in 'Woke' Brand as Hollywood & Tech World Drops DEI Obsession for 2nd Trump Term

Netflix’s response to President-elect Donald Trump’s reelection victory is the scheduled premier of a documentary on Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, a symbol of Hollywood wokism. Netflix, a streaming service giant that openly works with the Obamas, does not appear to be willing to shift its left-leaning corporate scope following Trump’s reelection as did Meta and Amazon. With Netflix’s earning call set for the end of January, its investor relations team refused to respond when Breitbart News requested comment about whether it had plans to defund DEI programs, publish content more friendly to President Trump, or distance itself from the Obamas. Co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos’ apparent unwillingness to rebalance the company’s corporate scope stands in contrast to actions taken by Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon’s Jeff Bozos. Meta shut down its biased fact checking program and added CEO of UFC and Trump supporter Dana White to its board. Amazon picked up the Melania Trump documentary. Before the November election, Bozos’ Washington Post refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris. “It is clear Netflix programming buyers at all levels have gotten an order from the top, Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters, not to touch content that is friendly toward MAGA or Trump,” said a producer with knowledge of Netflix’s political identity. “Other studios and streamers have publicly made a fast shift but Netflix execs at all levels are obviously scared.” Corporate shifts are common when political environments change. Just as DEI programs became popular after the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots that cost municipalities millions, companies like Lockheed Martin are announcing new government affairs personnel to work the incoming administration. Netflix’s silent position on the incoming administration is exacerbated by the streamer’s ongoing commitment to invest $100 million of shareholder money in DEI programs, CNBC reported: Netflix released a first-of-its-kind diversity study Friday to analyze the makeup of Netflix’s on-screen talent, as well as the behind-the-camera creators, producers, writers and directors. The report shows that the company has made progress, but still has more work to do to close diversity gaps. The company says it’s committing to an “inclusion lens” to its work, which co-CEO Ted Sarandos says means asking questions like, “Whose voice is missing? Is this portrayal authentic? Who is excluded?” The company also announced the creation of the Netflix Fund for Creative Equity, which will invest $100 million over the next five years in organizations that help underrepresented communities train and find jobs in TV and film. Netflix also committed to releasing an update on this study every two years through 2026. During the first years of the Biden administration, Netflix made overtures to conservatives by opposing authoritarian speech codes when it refused to cancel comedian Dave Chapelle on its platform. The decision helped Netflix steadily climb its way out of financial ruin in 2022. The streaming service’s stock price rebounded and experts project it to perform well into 2025. One of Netflix’s most anticipated projects this year is the release of a documentary on the Duchess of Sussex Megan Markle, who is an outspoken opponent of Donald Trump. Netflix will also continue to work with the Obamas and their production company. “Netflix is proud to partner with Barack and Michelle Obama’s Higher Ground Productions. Watch the acclaimed, award-winning movies and series they’ve brought to life,” the site advertises. Aligning with DEI, Netflix’s claims one of its values is “Inclusion — you recognize your biases and work to counteract them; you work to ensure everyone at Netflix can do their best work, whatever their culture, identity or background.” Netflix’s political corporate scope is amplified by their employees. Co-founder Reed Hastings reportedly donated $7 million to the Harris campaign. Nearly 100 percent of the Netflix employee donations, amounting to approximately $4.4 million, were in support of Democrats in 2024, according to Quiver Quantitative. “BI DEN,” Netflix’s social media head Lucie Zhang, who identifies as “She/Her” on LinkedIn, posted on X. Netflix’s vice president of inclusion Wade Davis II praised Michelle Obama’s DNC speech: “#MichelleObama brought both hands during her speech!!! Yes!!!! Let’s Go Kamala.” Trump won a landslide reelection in November with over 77 million votes, just short of Netflix’s reported 84.8 million paid streaming subscribers across the United States and Canada in the third quarter of 2024. The subscriber growth number slowed last quarter. This begs the question why Netflix would be exclusionary to this large audience. Following Trump’s victory, Sarandos, a big Obama donor, bent the knee and visited him at Mar-a-Lago, a pilgrimage several tech executives made, given the the scale of their business and the need to navigate regulatory hurdles. “EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND,” Trump posted on Truth Social after the meetings. What comes of it remains to be seen. Wendell Husebo is a political reporter with Breitbart News and a former RNC War Room Analyst. He is the author of Politics of Slave Morality.

Title: Jim Cramer on Meta Platforms, Inc (META): ‘I Find It To Be Little More Prurient’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other stocks. In one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, "Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming." He shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. "House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter," Cramer remarked. He added "What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough." Another news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could "be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal." One person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. "I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top," believes Cramer. He added "We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state." On the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months "Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership," he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes "you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow." Finally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared "I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified." Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated "I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad." Our Methodology To make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC’s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 235 Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the biggest social media companies in the world. The technology-focused nature of its CEO Mark Zuckerberg proved to be a boon for the stock in 2024. Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s shares ended the year 69% higher as investors were optimistic about its ability to monetize AI by selling features to advertisers. The firm also enjoys a strong moat in the AI sector as it has developed a foundational AI model. In 2025, Meta Platforms, Inc (NASDAQ:META)'s been in the news for scrapping fact-checking in the US and for Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. Here's what Cramer said: "I know Meta AI is supposed to be the most exciting. I find it to be little more prurient. When it comes to the metaverse I thought that Ralph Lauren was supposed to have a mall right next to, I don't know, Macy's. Hasn't really turned out that way but at the same time the dialogue has switched mostly to Taekwondo and rifles. And David, you better start shooting pigs [referring to Zuckerberg's hobby of hunting boars] if you want to be on board here. Overall META ranks 1st on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.

Title: Snap, Meta Stocks Jump as TikTok Ban Approaches

Wall Street investors appear to be betting on Snapchat and Instagram benefiting from TikTok’s U.S. exile The stock price for Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, jumped 8.3% on Wednesday morning, while Meta’s share price increased 3.7% as both companies look set to benefit from TikTok’s looming ban from the U.S. Snap’s Wall Street surge pushed the company to $12.28 per share and a market cap of $20.5 billion. The Santa Monica-based company’s stock price has been on a roller coaster ride to start 2025, but following Wednesday’s early gains, Snap’s stock price is up 9.25% on the year. Meanwhile Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is trading at $616.29 per share and has a market cap of $638.4 billion. The stock jumps are likely tied to TikTok saying it would shut down its app this coming Sunday if a last-minute deal is not made to keep the app active in the States. ByteDance, The app’s Beijing-based parent company, is facing a Jan. 19 deadline to divest TikTok’s American assets. TikTok’s decision to shut down the app — which has 170 million monthly American users — goes one step further than the law, signed by President Biden last April, requires. The law bans new downloads from Apple’s App Store and the Google Play app store, and also makes it “unlawful” to update the app. In other words, existing users could keep the app on their phones, but it would never update. If TikTok turns off, Snapchat and Instagram would likely see a boost in users and usage. YouTube would also presumably benefit, and the stock price of Alphabet, its parent company, is up 2.3% on Wednesday. And Snap, in a timely effort to make it easier for users to find influencers on the platform, launched a “find your favorites on Snapchat” campaign on Wednesday. The law banning TikTok requires ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations to remain operating in States. The chief concern U.S. lawmakers say they have with TikTok is that it could double as a spyware app for the Chinese communist government; TikTok, per Chinese law, is required to share user data if asked to do so. In the days leading up to the ban, two Chinese social apps — Xiaohongshu and Lemon8, which is also run by ByteDance — have raced to the top of Apple’s App Store (You can read more about Lemon8 by clicking here). A potential TikTok ban has been lingering for several years now. Donald Trump first proposed removing the app from the U.S. during his first term in office before Congress ultimately passed the law banning the app last year. Despite his initial support, President-elect Trump has since changed his tune on banning TikTok, saying last year that he would like to “save” the app. And in December, Trump reiterated he would like to keep TikTok in the U.S. He said he’d “take a look” at saving TikTok, noting he had a “warm spot” in his heart for it because it helped get young people to vote for him. The Supreme Court is currently weighing TikTok’s plea to overturn the law banning the app, but it does not appear likely before Sunday, when the app’s ban date hits.

Title: Nvidia’s $3 Trillion Rally Is On Edge, Wall Street Is Unfazed

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s $3 trillion run-up in market value in the two years since ChatGPT helped trigger an AI frenzy is bigger than any stock rally in history in such a short time span. But the landscape is now changing for the chipmaker. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson’s NYC Mayoral Run What LA’s Fires Mean for the City’s Housing Shortage In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework? Competitors and customers are stepping up efforts to take a bigger slice of the artificial intelligence chip market. The sector’s blistering revenue growth is slowing. The Biden White House is looking to limit the sale of Nvidia’s most-advanced chips abroad, although it’s unclear how President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming administration will handle that. Sounds scary? None of these risks are deterring investors from betting that Nvidia’s rally could add hundreds of billions of dollars more in market value in 2025 as the deluge of spending on AI computing keeps gaining steam. “I’m not concerned we’ve seen a peak in Nvidia,” said Kevin Mahn, chief investment officer at Hennion & Walsh Asset Management. “There’s more growth to be had, although we should also see more volatility. The AI revolution is going to be a long road with a lot of potholes.” That turbulence has been on display recently, with Nvidia shares slumping after a presentation by Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang fell short of investors’ high expectations. The stock dropped for five-straight sessions, shedding 12% since hitting a record on Jan. 6, as of its Tuesday close. It rose 1.7% on Wednesday. Investors say these kinds of swings come with the territory. “Nvidia’s stock is always going to be way more volatile than the market,” said Joanne Feeney, portfolio manager and partner at Advisors Capital Management, which raised its price target on the shares earlier this week. “We see it as having multiple years of well-above average growth in earnings, and we do see that as explaining and sustaining the valuation.” Nvidia shares are projected to rise about 30% over the coming year, according to the average of analyst price targets compiled by Bloomberg. That would give the chipmaker a market value of more than $4 trillion, potentially dwarfing its closest peers Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Its revenue is expected to hit $129 billion in its current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 30, up from $27 billion two years ago. That said, there are plenty of potential hazards ahead. Here’s a look at the biggest issues Nvidia faces in the coming year: AI Spending Nvidia’s rally ultimately depends on demand for AI services. Nearly half its revenue comes from a handful of tech giants who are rushing to add computing capacity. Capital expenditures by Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. are projected to hit a combined $257 billion in the current fiscal year, up from $209 billion in 2024. Of course, those plans could change if the companies and their customers aren’t generating the big sales they expected from AI. “At some point we’re going to need to see new applications drive revenue acceleration for other companies for this investment to continue,” said Gil Luria, head of technology research at D.A. Davidson and one of only eight of 78 analysts tracked by Bloomberg who doesn’t have a buy rating on the shares. Outside of hardware makers like Nvidia, the most visible AI revenue growth is coming from the big web services providers like Amazon, Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure. However, it’s still a relatively small amount compared with how much the companies are spending on developing the technology. So far, few of the tech giants’ cloud computing customers are seeing significant revenue growth from AI. Salesforce.com Inc. shares have rallied on high expectations for new AI offerings, but the customer relationship management software company hasn’t seen much of a sales boost yet. Palantir Technologies Inc., which makes data analysis software, has said its AI services are driving revenue growth. “It’s imperative that the hyperscaler customers start generating meaningful returns,” Luria said. Competition Nvidia has a virtual monopoly on AI accelerators and is attempting to stay ahead of the competition by speeding up the pace for rolling out new chip lines. Its latest, Blackwell, initially faced manufacturing challenges that slowed its release. But Huang said it’s in full production now and will begin shipping in the current quarter, adding that demand for Blackwell is “very strong” and expected to exceed supply for several quarters. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is probably Nvidia’s closest competitor. But its projected AI accelerator sales of more than $5 billion in 2024 are just a sliver of Nvidia’s expected $114 billion in data center revenue in its current fiscal year. Intel Corp., which is in the midst of a troubled turnaround, is even further behind as weaker than expected orders for AI accelerators have led to sales that the company said won’t reach its target of $500 million for 2024. Meanwhile, chipmakers Broadcom Inc. and Marvell Technology Inc. are gathering momentum in sales of custom-made semiconductors and networking components used in data centers. Broadcom forecast in December that the market for the AI components it designs will reach as much as $90 billion by fiscal 2027, sending its shares soaring and raising concerns that so-called ASIC chips could take share away from Nvidia. However, it’s unlikely that those custom chips will hurt Nvidia much given Blackwell’s significant technological advancement, according to Morgan Stanley analysts led by Joseph Moore. “Competing directly with Nvidia on cluster level specifications will likely remain a challenge,” they wrote in December. And then there are the chipmaker’s biggest customers, who are hustling to develop their own semiconductors to avoid Nvidia’s high prices. Amazon has begun shipping the second generation of Trainium, which it aims to string together in clusters of up to 100,000 chips. Alphabet’s Google began building an AI chip a decade ago, and the latest edition is expected to be widely available this year. Microsoft Corp. announced an accelerator called Maia and a central processing unit in late 2023. Valuation How much investors will pay for Nvidia’s stock comes down to its growth outlook. With customers set to spend more on hardware and competition still playing catch up, that view looks bright at the moment. The shares are priced at almost 31 times profits projected over the next 12 months, below the average over the past decade of 34 times, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, that valuation requires Nvidia’s profits to continue to boom at a time when growth is slowing and higher costs related to the development of Blackwell are expected to weigh on margins. Nvidia sales are projected to climb 112% in fiscal 2025, 53% in fiscal 2026 and 21% in fiscal 2027. Its gross margin is expected to dip as low as 73% in the current quarter, down from 75% in the previous period, Nvidia said in November. However, it anticipates margins rebounding when production ramps up. For a company that’s growing as fast as Nvidia, it all adds up to a fair price, according to Scott Yuschak, managing director of equity strategy at Truist Advisory Services. “There’s still plenty of growth left for Nvidia in 2025 and there’s still reason to be interested in the stock,” Yuschak said. “Still, that number depends on bigger and bigger spending. If there are any signs of a slowdown in AI spending, the price investors are willing to pay for Nvidia shares will fall.” Top Tech Stories The US plans to unveil more regulations aimed at keeping advanced chips made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other producers from flowing to China, part of a flurry of measures introduced by the Biden administration during its final days in office. Elon Musk cheated Twitter shareholders out of more than $150 million by waiting too long to disclose his growing stake in the company as he prepared a takeover bid, the US Securities and Exchange Commission claimed in a lawsuit filed days before the Trump administration takes over. SpaceX launched a pair of commercial satellites carrying lunar rovers as competition intensifies in the private sector’s race to the moon. Alphabet Inc. Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai is joining Silicon Valley executives bidding for a London-based cricket team, according to people familiar with the matter. Synthesia, an artificial intelligence startup that lets businesses produce lifelike video avatars, has raised $180 million in a funding round making it one of Britain’s largest AI companies.

Estimates for California's devastating fires continue to grow with some estimates reaching as high ... [+] as $180 billion. (Photo by David Swanson / AFP) (Photo by DAVID SWANSON/AFP via Getty Images) Key Takeaways Stocks were mixed on Tuesday with the S&P 500 up just 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite was down 0.2%. Both the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 1% and 0.5%, respectively. The muted moves came following the release of the Producer Price Index, which showed slower than expected increases in prices. Tuesday's Core PPI was forecast to show an increase of 0.4% on a month-to-month basis, but the actual increase was just 0.2%. That number offered a preview of today's Consumer Price Index, which was expected to show core prices increased month-over-month by 0.3% and a yearly increase of 3.3%, according to Bloomberg. The actual numbers were slightly below those expectations. Month-over-month was up 0.2% while year-over-year, prices were higher by 3.2%. Turning to earnings, major banks are kicking things off this morning. So far, we've heard from JP Morgan who beat on both the top and bottom lines, sending that stock higher by 2% in premarket. Wells Fargo also beat on earnings. One standout metric was their investment banking fees which grew by 59%. Wells in not typically the first name that comes to mind when discussing investment banking, so this may be an area of growth to keep an eye on. But net interest income is the standout metric here for both banks. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo forecast strong growth for net interest income in 2025. Goldman Sachs also released their earnings in premarket. The company crushed expectations across the board. Goldman said it expected investment banking and trading fees to grow double digits in 2025. Lastly, Citigroup is out with earnings, issuing beats on the top and bottom lines. All four banking stocks are trading higher in premarket activity. A few other stocks in the news include Meta, Alphabet and Eli Lilly. Meta announced it will more aggressively manage out underperforming workers and as a result the company will cut 5% of its workforce in the U.S. As the job market is cooling, we're seeing the power pendulum swing back towards companies. This comes after a red-hot labor market was giving job seekers a significant advantage following Covid. Alphabet is being investigated by U.K antitrust regulators over how Google search results may affect competition. Lastly, Eli Lilly cut its fourth-quarter forecast citing weaker than expected growth for the company's insulin and weight loss drugs. However, the company did say they expect strong growth for their weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound in 2025. Turning to the chip sector, the Biden administration announced it plans more regulations for advanced chips being produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and others from being exported to China. Another stock in the AI chip sector that's making news is Nvidia. Shares of that stock have fallen for the past five trading days and are down 12% from their highs, putting the stock in a correction. This is particularly noteworthy because Nvidia has been at the forefront of the stock market rally over the past couple years. Therefore, it will be interesting to see if this is simply some short-term profit taking, the beginning of a longer-term downturn for the overall market, or a changing of the guard and opportunity for another sector to lead the market. A few more odds and ends. After hitting a low of just over $89,000 on Monday, bitcoin is trading higher and looks set to make another run at $100,000. Oil prices remain within striking distance of $80 per barrel. As I've previously mentioned, so long as oil remains below $80, its impact on the economy is relatively muted. However, a break above $80 may prompt fears of a return of inflation. Finally, Forbes is saying the cost from the California fires may reach as high as $150 billion. This is simply a tragic story and one that, unfortunately, continues to unfold. For today, the story is a combination of earnings and muted inflation. The outlook for the banking sector, especially net interest income, is being buoyed by forecasts for fewer interest rates cuts by the Fed. Elevated rates mean more interest income. The outlook for rates should come as no surprise to regular readers of my column as I've been discussing it ad nauseam. Combine that with a weaker than expected CPI and you get stocks up nearly 2% in premarket trading. I would caution readers that this is just the very beginning of earnings season and there is a long way to go still. However, the start is looking pretty good and may be exactly what this market needs. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

Accurate energy demand forecasting is critical for efficient energy management and planning. Recent advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets have fueled the development of machine learning models. However, selecting the most appropriate features to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness remains a key challenge. This study proposes an ensemble approach that integrates a genetic algorithm with multiple forecasting models to optimize feature selection. The genetic algorithm identifies the optimal subset of features from a dataset that includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal characteristics. These selected features are then used to train three base learners: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The predictions from these models are combined using a stacking ensemble technique to generate the final forecast. To enhance model evaluation, we divided the dataset into weekday and weekend subsets, allowing for a more detailed analysis of energy consumption patterns. To ensure the reliability of our findings, we conducted ten simulations and applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to the results. The proposed model demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 130.6, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.38%, and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 99.41 for weekday data. The model also maintained high accuracy for weekend predictions, with an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This research provides valuable insights for energy analysts and contributes to developing more sophisticated demand forecasting methods.

In the modern era, accurate energy demand forecasting has become an essential component of efficient energy management. Energy consumption is rising for various reasons, such as population growth, increasing building energy needs, and expanding technological applications. According to the data presented in [1], global energy consumption is expected to rise by approximately 70% by the year 2040. This alarming figure has necessitated the development of advanced predictive models to forecast energy demand, which are crucial for optimizing energy use in smart cities, thereby making them more efficient and sustainable. Machine learning models have become increasingly popular due to advancements in computational techniques and the availability of large amounts of data [2]. However, a critical challenge in these models is the effective selection of relevant features that enhance the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. To address this issue, we have implemented a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for optimal feature selection. The study first trains the model to determine the best features from the dataset with the help of GA; afterward, these features are fed into a stacking-based ensemble model for further training and evaluation. At its core, energy demand forecasting may be broken down into two distinct ways: traditional methods and more modern machine learning-based techniques [3, 4]. Conventional methods include statistical analysis, Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing (EA), and regression-based approaches [5]. These methods have proven effective for linear problems. On the other hand, machine learning methods are adept at handling non-linear scenarios. Notable among these are Random Forest (RF) [6], Decision Tree (DT) [7], and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [8], which have been utilized for energy demand forecasting, as discussed in recent studies. However, it is important to note that while machine learning models offer substantial advantages in time series prediction, they are also susceptible to limitations, such as the potential for becoming trapped in local minima, particularly if hyperparameters are not optimally tuned. Several diverse methods have been developed for forecasting future energy consumption, from the very short term (minutes) to the very long term (years) (weeks) [9, 10]. Accurately predicting energy demand is crucial; an overestimation can lead to unnecessary conversion of excess energy, which is costly in terms of time, money, and resources, while underestimation may result in blackouts from supply line overloads. Typically, forecasting is divided into three categories based on the prediction horizon: short-term load forecasting (from an hour to a week), medium-term load forecasting (from a month to a year), and long-term load forecasting (beyond a year) [11]. Prediction of short-term loads is a major challenge. Indeed, schedules may be created to determine the distribution of generating resources, operational limits, environmental restrictions, and equipment usage restrictions with the help of accurate and dependable predictions [12]. In addition, the power systems may be optimized more using these predictions for the expected load condition in the future. Key contributions of this paper are as follows: The evolution of the paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, the related work of the study has been explained in Section 2. Section 3 discusses the methodology used in this study. The experimental setup for the training of our model is then described in Section 4. Our proposed framework is presented in Section 5. The obtained results are carefully examined and discussed in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 presents a summary of the key findings, discusses their implications, and suggests directions for further investigation. Electricity distribution networks are foundational to long-term prosperity and societal advancement. Power consumption forecasts must always be accurate and efficient when developing energy predictions for the dynamic electricity sector. In the dynamic electricity sector, power consumption forecasts must be both precise and efficient. Over recent decades, a myriad of methods for predicting future energy demand has emerged [13, 14]. Typically, these methods employ time series datasets of past energy usage to construct forecasting models [15]. The majority of the approaches presented for predicting a building’s energy usage may be broken down into two classes: statistical and artificial intelligence-based. For forecasting and analyzing energy use in the future, statistical approaches use the available historical data to build probabilistic models. ARIMA, ARMA, and ARIMAX are well-known statistical methods that have been used to predict future energy consumption. However, AI-driven approaches can improve forecasting accuracy due to their ability to identify non-linear trends in time series data [16]. Despite the widespread use of feature selection techniques like correlation-based, filter, and wrapper methods in research, there remains a significant opportunity to incorporate more sophisticated techniques to refine these predictions further. LSTM networks have demonstrated promising results in time series analysis [17]. Older variants of RNNs, such as Recurrent Backpropagation, require a very long time to learn and store the information over an extended period. To address these challenges, Hochreiter et al. [18] developed a gradient-based method called LSTM neural network [19], which is the extended version of a recurrent neural network. LSTM networks have both long-term memory and short-term memory, and it reduces the problem of exploding and vanishing gradient. Numerous researchers have leveraged the LSTM network to forecast energy demand. Bouktif et al. [20] integrated various machine learning models along with LSTM to develop a model for short-term load demand of energy. In another study, the authors [21] presented a statistical model, SARIMA, to predict hourly wind speed in the coastal area of Scotland. They utilized three-time series datasets collected from different elevations. The accuracy of the forecasting model can be enhanced by using a combination of the homogeneous or heterogeneous models. Li et al. [22] considered this benefit and proposed a multi-energy forecasting method for energy systems using a fusion of a Convolutional Neural Network and GRU (CNN-GRU) with transfer learning on a parallel architecture. The performance of the model was further refined through hyperparameter tuning, leading to more accurate results. A summary of notable studies on demand forecasting is provided in Table 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t001 Significant progress has been made in enhancing energy demand forecasting using deep learning models. However, a gap remains in optimizing feature selection within these models. To address this gap, we propose a two-tiered approach. The first step involves applying a genetic algorithm to identify and select the most influential features. In the subsequent step, we employ a stacking ensemble method that combines the strengths of multiple predictive models. This synergistic approach not only refines the feature set but also integrates various models to substantially improve the accuracy of energy demand forecasts. Numerous studies have explored data-driven techniques due to their ability to predict loads and energy consumption across various scenarios [33]. The standard data-driven approach typically minimizes the sum of squared vertical distances to determine the optimal parameters [34]. A widely used method is linear regression [35], which identifies the best-fitting straight line across the training data. In addition to the linear model, ridge regression penalizes the extreme values of the weighted matrix to deal with multi-collinearity [36]. There has been a noticeable improvement in the development and interpretation of these linear regression models. An example of a non-parametric model is the K-nearest neighbor, in which the forecast is just the mean of all the neighbors [37]. With the optimal parameter settings, this method provides accurate outcomes for electrical load forecasting; it is also relatively easy to understand and implement in practice. Rather than relying on a single decision tree, which can lead to overfitting, ensemble models employ a network of decision trees to make predictions, such as additional trees and random forests. Gradient boosting further enhances tree accuracy by employing an ensemble of weak learners that assign greater weight to misclassified predictions [38]. The objective of this study is to develop an advanced method for predicting energy consumption. This is accomplished by integrating deep learning models using a stacking ensemble approach with a feature selection process optimized through a genetic algorithm (GA). With GA, our goal is to find the optimal Chromosome C*, that maximizes Fitness (C) as given in Eq (1) (1) Where C = [c1, c2, ……, cn] is the chromosome, and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. With stacking, our goal is to minimize the loss function using the feature subset X' chosen by the GA and forecasts generated by the stacking model given in Eq (2) (2) Here Mj(X') represents the prediction output of the j-th model, and S is the stacking layer function that aggregates the prediction from the individual models. In summary, the GA enhances the quality of the model input by optimizing the feature space, whereas the stacked model utilizes the advantages of numerous deep learning architectures to provide reliable prediction outputs. In this subsection, we outline the key challenges in energy demand forecasting and explain how our proposed method effectively addresses each challenge. The high-dimensional nature of datasets in energy demand forecasting presents a significant challenge in selecting the most relevant features [39]. This task is computationally intensive and often includes redundant or irrelevant features, which can degrade model performance. This study employs a GA to search for the optimal subset of features systematically. The GA uses a fitness function based on the inverse of Mean Squared Error to evaluate predictive accuracy given in Eq (3) (3) Where C is a chromosome representing a subset of features. A crucial challenge in energy demand forecasting is preventing overfitting by ensuring the model works effectively with unknown data. Overfitting occurs when the model captures noise in the training data, resulting in poor performance on new data [40]. By using the GA to determine the most informative features, our approach improves the model’s generalizability. The high-dimensional feature spaces might result in longer training times and more resource use due to the computational complexity. This challenge is significant in practical applications where computing efficiency is the highest priority. Our genetic algorithm-based approach addresses this difficulty by decreasing the number of features. The GA progressively improves the feature subset, reducing input space that retains the most significant features. Let n be the original number of features and k the number of selected features after GA optimization, where k < n. In this section, we provide a concise overview of the methodologies employed in this study. This section presents an introduction to the basics of time series analysis. To get a more thorough analysis of time series analysis, we suggest reading [41, 42]. Time Series (TS) analysis is a valuable tool for studying energy demand patterns, which inherently vary over time due to their time-dependent nature. It involves applying statistical or artificial intelligence methods to predict future trends by analyzing previously collected information. A time series composed of P real-valued data points a1, …., aP each ai (where 1 ≤ i ≤ P) signifies the value recorded at the time i. The task of time series forecasting can be described as predicting future values az+1, …. az+k based on the preceding a1, …, az values (where z + k ≤ P). The goal here is to reduce the difference between the forecasted value and the actual value az+j (for 1 ≤ j ≤ k). In this context, ‘z’ represents the historical window, indicating the number of past data points considered for making predictions, and ‘k’ denotes the prediction horizon, which is the extent of the future we aim to predict. Time series analysis has been applied in a wide range of real-life applications such as Anomaly detection [43], financial indices [44], Healthcare [45], Weather prediction, and energy consumption [46]. In contrast to traditional approaches, which focus on parametric-based models, namely auto-regressive, Moving Average, and structural TS [47], the Artificial intelligence-based model offers purely data-driven approaches. GA are adaptive heuristic search algorithms based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics [48]. With this technique, our goal is to identify the subset of features that contributes the most to the predictive power of a given model. In this study, we employed the DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) library, which provides a flexible and customizable framework for creating genetic algorithms. Below is a detailed description of the GA process for feature selection. Let C = [c1, c2, ……, cn ] be a chromosome, where n is the number of features and ci is a binary variable indicating the inclusion (1) or exclusion (0) of feature i. The fitness of an individual is evaluated based on the performance of the model using the selected subset of features. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) is used as the fitness metric presented in Eq (4). The goal is to find the optimal chromosome C* that maximizes Fitness (C) Formally: The steps employed for determining the best features are shown in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g001 The GA identifies the best subset of features from the dataset, which includes historical energy consumption, weather variables, and temporal features, by exploring various combinations to maximize predictive accuracy. The GA reduces redundancy and noise by choosing only the most relevant features, resulting in more accurate and robust model training. This optimized feature set enhances the model’s performance, allowing it to generalize better from training data to unseen data, as shown by improved Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. Furthermore, reducing the number of features decreases computational complexity, leading to faster training times without sacrificing accuracy. Ensemble models have gained popularity in recent years mainly because of the great outcomes they produce on various tasks, such as classification and regression issues [49]. These techniques include the combination of multiple models of learning to enhance the performance of each model individually. Ensemble learning was first explored in the 1990s when it proved that many weak learners could be turned into strong learners. Typically, two stages are involved in this process. Initially, a variety of base learners are developed from the training data. Subsequently, these learners are combined in the second stage to create a cohesive prediction model. This results in multiple forecasts derived from individual base learners being merged into a more effective composite model, which typically outperforms each of the base models. Consolidating several effective individual models into a single enhanced model usually results in greater predictive accuracy. Bagging, boosting, and stacking are the three most popular and well-known fundamental ensemble approaches [50]. In bagging, multiple models are created, with each model’s results given equal weight, and a voting method determines the most common outcome. For regression, the mean of predictions is typically used. Boosting, similar to bagging, differs by assigning varying weights to models, with the final result being a weighted vote. In regression contexts, this means a weighted average. On the other hand, Stacking employs different algorithms for model building, followed by a combiner algorithm that uses these models’ outputs to make final predictions. Any ensemble approach can be used as the combiner in stacking. Ensemble learning techniques have been applied in various time series forecasting methods, including energy demand. Zhang et al. [51] introduced an extreme learning machine (ELM) method utilized in the electricity market. Tan et al. [52] combined wavelet transform with ARIMA and GARCH models for price forecasting in Spanish and PJM electricity markets. In another study, authors [49] developed an ensemble model using Bayesian Clustering by Dynamics (BCD) and SVM, which was tested on New York City’s historical load data. Later, Tasnim et al. [21] created an ensemble framework based on the cluster for predicting wind power, employing regression models on wind data from various Australian locations. LSTM is a specific form of RNN structure developed to tackle the challenge of the vanishing gradient problem and efficiently capture the patterns in sequential data [53]. This is achieved by utilizing a specialized gating mechanism that effectively controls the transmission of information within the network. A standard LSTM unit has three primary gates, as shown in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g002 where w and b are weights and biases and ⏀ represent activation function, which is sigmoid in our study. Uf is a weight matrix associated with the forget gate. Unlike standard LSTM, BiLSTM is able to learn from both the past and future as processes input in both directions. This feature enhances its capability to model sequential dependencies in language processing tasks. BiLSTM involves adding an additional LSTM layer that processes the input sequence in reverse. The outputs of both forward and backward layers are then merged using techniques like averaging, summing, multiplying, or concatenating. The unrolled BiLSTM structure is presented in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g003 The forward and backward propagation output of the above diagram has been shown below: Eqs (11), (12), and (13). Where x, h, and c are the input state, hidden state, and temporary state. The GRU model demonstrates superior computational efficiency by employing a lower number of training parameters. As a result, memory utilization and training times are reduced. The simpler architecture, consisting of two gates, Eqs (14) and (15), reduces the possibility of overfitting on smaller datasets. Moreover, the GRU shows improved stability during the training process, requiring reduced fine-tuning for hyperparameters. Fig 4 shows a simple GRU network. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g004 Update Gate (Zt): (14) Reset Gate (Rt): (15) where W are the weights, and σ represents the activation function. ht-1 are the hidden states. The stochastic nature of deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and GA, where random initializations and training processes can lead to variability in performance, makes it crucial to ensure the reliability and robustness of our results [54]. We conducted repeated simulations to address this, running each model 10 times with different random seeds. We recorded the performance metrics for each run, including MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE. Eqs (18)–(21) provide the equations for these metrics. To statistically compare the performance metrics across different runs, we employed the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This non-parametric test is suitable for comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test does not assume normality, making it a robust choice for our analysis [55]. This test works by ranking the absolute differences between paired observations, assigning ranks, and then computing the sum of ranks for the positive and negative differences. The test statistic W is the smaller of these sums. The p-value is derived from the distribution of W under the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the paired samples. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test is calculated as follows: We collected the dataset containing information on net demand and consumption in the UK, covering the period from 2020 to 2023. While preparing the data, we apply techniques to handle missing data points, which are represented as NaN or null values within our dataset. To impute the missing values, we calculate the mean μ and median σ, that can effectively transform a feature set X from X = {x1, x2, …., xn} to , where x’i = xi if xi is not missing, and x'i = μ or σ otherwise. There are three categories of data transformation that are typically utilized in the neural network. In this model, we used linear transformation Eq (16), which scales the data either into (0 to 1) or (-1 to +1) range. In order to account for any differences in data behavior, the dataset is analyzed by classifying it according to temporal patterns, specifically by differentiating between weekdays and weekends. The entire dataset is divided into two parts. 80% of the data was chosen for training, while the remaining 20% was used for validation. Validation data is further refined by dividing data into four distinct samples (S1, S2, S3, S4), enabling a comprehensive evaluation that enhances the robustness and generalizability of findings. The dataset contains a total of 43 features, out of which, after applying GA, we got the four highly correlated features with the target feature for the training for our model. We have done exploratory analysis on these features to get better insights about the data. We separate a single feature on which we wish to make the prediction. In our case, it is Net Demand. We need to scale this feature, so we used the MinMaxScaler library of Python. The dataset did not contain any missing values. The two-month training graph shows a strong daily cyclical pattern with daytime peaks and nighttime drops, as shown in Fig 5. Energy demand ranges between 17,500 and 35,000 daily, showing no long-term trend. The graph’s density shows high-frequency data collection, providing an in-depth view of energy consumption trends with potential outliers from demand drops. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g005 We further illustrated the variations in net energy demand over weekdays and weekends in April and May 2023. It is possible to see a pattern of highs and lows that repeats itself every day, with times when demand rises and times when it falls. Demand changes a lot during the week, with higher levels of consumption during the day and lower levels of demand at night. This repetitive behavior can also be seen on the weekends, but the volume isn’t as strong. This could be because people use the system differently when they don’t have to work during the week Fig 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g006 Additionally, we used box plots to examine the distribution of energy generation features between weekdays and weekends. The visual representations shown in Fig 7 clearly illustrate a noticeable difference in the core tendencies and variabilities of the two temporal segments. The interquartile ranges shown indicate a greater level of uniformity in energy production patterns on weekdays compared to weekends, especially in the ‘GENERATION’ and ‘FOSSIL’ categories. Outliers, identified by the data points located outside the whiskers of the box plots, were present in both categories, indicating occasional deviations from the usual energy production levels. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g007 In this study, we have adopted a stacking approach for the regression problem, considering it the most appropriate, as discussed in [56]. The general structure of this method is illustrated in Fig 8. To define the stacking ensemble scheme more precisely, given P distinct learning algorithms Mh, for k = 1 to P, and the data pair 〈a, b〉 {a = (a1, …., az) representing the recorded z values and b = (az+1, …., az+k) k values to be predicted}, let , (for h = 1 to P, j = 1 to k) be the model generated by Mh to forecast az+j. The function gj, which combines these models for prediction, can be a standard function developed through another algorithm utilizing a machine learning system. The predicted value is then calculated using this method, Eq (17). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g008 In this work, we have employed and optimized various hyperparameters, such as Epoch, which represents a complete iteration of training data. Dropout mitigated the issue of overfitting. The learning rate refers to the pace at which the model updates its parameters during training. Batch size, on the other hand, represents the number of samples processed by the network at each iteration. The hidden layer, positioned between the input and output layers, determines the number of nodes it should contain. In order to optimize GPU utilization, we have implemented a batch size of 12. Additionally, we have chosen a dropout rate of 0.2 to mitigate overfitting. The dropout rate is 0.2. By removing 20% of the nodes in the hidden layer, we effectively minimize the occurrence of overfitting. The learning rate should not be very low; hence, the learning rate is adjusted to 0.1. After all these adjustments, we achieved a reduction in the mean squared error (MSE) to a level below 0.01, as shown in Fig 9. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g009 The efficacy of our study was evaluated using several variables [57]. The following procedures were used for each, and we have shown in these equations in Eqs (18), (19), (20), and (21) The accuracy of a model is calculated from MAPE. Our proposed method includes a multi-step process that starts with data preparation and culminates with evaluating the predictions. Technically, a common preprocessing formula for data preprocessing and feature selections is presented in Eqs (22) and (23), Here, D is the original dataset, Dp is the preprocessed dataset, and ∅ is the preprocessing function that includes data cleaning, transformation, normalization, and temporal feature extraction. Here Fs is the set of selected features, and GA is the Genetic Algorithm applied to Dp for feature selection. We deploy three base deep learning models, LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU, which we have already discussed in section 3.3. The LSTM model is adept at capturing long-term dependencies, the BiLSTM model leverages information from both past and future time points, and the GRU model efficiently models short-term dependencies shown in Eqs (24)–(26). Here, ht represents the hidden state at time t. The hidden states of each base learner are combined using a stacking ensemble approach with a linear regression meta-learner presented in Eqs (27) and (28), respectively. Here, H is the concatenated hidden states from each base learner, is the predicted energy demand, and β0, β1, β2, β3 are the coefficients learned by the meta-learner. When the whole procedure is expressed as an equation, it can be written as in Eq (29) (29) Fig 10 demonstrates the entire process of the proposed framework. The model comprises several stages. A thorough preprocessing procedure is applied to the dataset, which includes data cleaning to fix errors, data transformation to organize the information for analysis, variable standardization to make them more comparable, and temporal feature extraction to take advantage of trends that change over time. After the preprocessing is completed, a genetic algorithm is then used for feature selection. This computational evolution approach uses mutation and crossover to enhance the prediction skills of the feature set population, mimicking natural selection. The whole GA process is shown in Fig 1. We evaluate the fitness of each feature set based on how well it predicts energy use. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g010 In the model implementation phase, three separate recurrent neural networks—GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM—are trained as the base models using the features that GA selected. We used a stacking ensemble approach to best use each neural network’s capabilities. A meta-model is trained in this ensemble to merge the forecasts of the GRU, BiLSTM, and LSTM basis models into a single, more precise prediction. In the last stage, statistical matrices such as MSE, MAE, MAPE, and RMSE are used to measure the accuracy of forecasts and conduct a thorough evaluation of this composite model’s performance. The performance of the proposed model was evaluated through multiple metrics, namely RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Detailed mathematical formulations for these evaluation metrics are provided in Section 4.6. In the dataset analyzed for this study, two distinct energy demand patterns were identified, as shown in Fig 6. The first pattern is associated with weekends, where a notable decrease in energy demand is observed. In contrast, the second pattern corresponds to weekdays, characterized by a consistent increase in energy demand. The data was systematically categorized according to these patterns, and the model was then trained to handle them effectively. The results of this comparative analysis are displayed in Fig 11 for the weekday pattern and in Fig 12 for the weekend pattern. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g011 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g012 After training the architecture presented in this study using the data patterns illustrated in Fig 6, we first tested the model on the training dataset. The outcomes of this test are detailed in Table 2. To further our objective, we then evaluated the model’s performance using a hidden validation dataset from the energy demand data. The results of this evaluation are shown in Table 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t002 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t003 An additional performance assessment was also conducted by dividing the entire validation dataset into four distinct samples. The model’s performance was then re-evaluated on each of these samples separately. The outcomes of these evaluations are documented in Fig 13 and Table 4. Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). Actual vs predicted graph for all four samples (S1, S2, S3, S4). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g013 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t004 In the final analysis, individual models using LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM architectures were developed for the identified demand patterns. Their comparative performance is illustrated in Fig 14. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. LSTM ‐ (a) for weekend. (a’) for weekdays. BiLSTM ‐ (b) for weekdays, (b’) for weekend. GRU ‐ (c) for weekdays, (c’) for weekend. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g014 In Table 4, we provide a comprehensive evaluation, presenting the overall performance scores of all models across the four validation samples. Deep learning models are inherently stochastic, which means that they can produce different results on different executions. To demonstrate the reliability of our proposed model, we executed the entire program ten times. For each run, we recorded the error metrics, as shown in Tables 5 and 6. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t005 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t006 To determine if the differences in performance metrics across different runs were statistically significant, we applied the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. The results are summarized in Table 7. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.t007 The p-values indicate whether there is a significant difference between the models’ performances over multiple runs. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant difference. In this case, the p-values for all comparisons (Ensemble vs. LSTM, Ensemble vs. BiLSTM, and Ensemble vs. GRU) across all metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) are 0.001953125, which is significantly less than the 0.05 threshold. This demonstrates that the ensemble model consistently shows a statistically significant improvement in performance over the individual models. The prediction accuracy criteria for assessment are schematically shown in Fig 15. Most of the error lies around zero. Therefore, mathematical findings confirm the predicted accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g015 The findings indicate that the Stacking-GA model consistently achieves better results compared to the separate deep learning models in all criteria during both weekdays and weekends. In Sample S1 on weekdays, the Stacking-GA model had the lowest MAE (494.62) for weekdays Fig 16(A), and MAE (534.25) for weekends Fig 16(B), which indicates its improved predictive accuracy compared to the solo models. Similarly, the observed trend is stable in all samples, suggesting that the ensemble technique successfully captures the fundamental patterns in energy consumption. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. MAE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g016 The RMSE values, which indicate the level of volatility in the predictions, drop in the following order: LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM, and Stacking-GA. This further highlights the resilience of the ensemble approach. Furthermore, the MAPE shown in Fig 17(A) and 17(B), and RMSE shown in Fig 18(A) and 18(B) provide additional evidence supporting the enhanced precision and dependability of the Stacking-GA model. The performance difference amongst the models is particularly evident on weekends, possibly indicating the enhanced challenge of predicting energy demand during these periods due to less predictable consumption patterns.

RMSE score of LSTM, GRU, BiLSM, and Stacking-GA based model for both (a) weekdays and (b) weekends. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0310465.g018 In summary, the Stacking-GA model demonstrates a significant improvement in prediction accuracy compared to individual deep learning models such as LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU. Due to the stochastic nature of these models, we conducted repeated simulations, running each model ten times with different random seeds and recording the performance metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE) for each run. To ensure the reliability of our results, we used the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test to compare the performance metrics across the different runs. The Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test results, with p-values of 0.001953125 for all comparisons, indicate a statistically significant improvement in the performance of the ensemble model over the individual models across all metrics. The enhanced performance in energy demand forecasting is likely attributed to the combination of feature selection, ensemble learning, and the incorporation of a Genetic Algorithm. The ensemble deep learning framework proposed in this study has significant implications and potential applications in real-world energy demand forecasting scenarios. It provides accurate and robust forecasts, which are crucial for various stakeholders in the energy section. The ensemble framework, which combines the LSTM, BiLST, and GRU models, improves the accuracy of energy demand predictions. Better accuracy is crucial for utility firms, grid operators, and policymakers to make well-informed choices about energy generation, distribution, and management. Our method is adaptable to various forecasting horizons, whether short-term, medium-term, or long-term. This adaptability makes it suitable for different applications, such as day-ahead forecasting for grid operation, week-ahead forecasting for maintenance scheduling, and long-term forecasting for infrastructure planning. The use of a GA for feature selection allows the framework to handle complex and high-dimensional data efficiently. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where large amounts of data from smart meters, weather stations, and other sources need to be processed to generate accurate forecasts. With developments in real-time data collecting and processing technology, our ensemble framework may be integrated into smart grid systems to give real-time energy demand forecasts. This has the potential to increase energy distribution efficiency and reliability while also making it easier to integrate distributed energy resources. This research presents a significant advancement in energy demand forecasting by introducing an innovative stacking ensemble approach. The integration of LSTM, GRU, and BiLSTM networks, underpinned by a genetic algorithm for feature selection, marks a novel methodology in addressing the complexities of energy demand prediction. We have also utilized the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test for statistical validation and ran the simulations ten times to ensure our results hold up. The performance evaluation was conducted using three key metrics: RMSE, MAPE, and MAE. To ensure the model’s robustness against the variability in energy consumption patterns, the data was segmented into weekday and weekend categories for analysis. The results from the validation data highlight the model’s exceptional precision, with a weekday performance marked by an RMSE of 130.6, a MAPE of 0.38%, and an MAE of 99.41. For weekend projections, the model maintained its accuracy, recording an RMSE of 137.41, a MAPE of 0.42%, and an MAE of 105.67. This level of precision indicates the model’s effectiveness in capturing the complexities of energy demand patterns. Additionally, The use of a genetic algorithm for feature selection has proven to be a key factor in the model’s success. It efficiently identifies the most influential predictors, improving the model’s performance. Furthermore, The stacking-based ensemble model, integrating multiple deep learning techniques, showcases a robust framework that outperforms traditional single-model approaches in forecasting accuracy. The study not only contributes to the theoretical understanding of feature selection in machine learning but also offers practical implications for energy analysts and policymakers. Enhancing the accuracy of energy demand forecasts aids in efficient energy management and planning, which is crucial in the context of growing energy needs and sustainability challenges.

Posted on January 15, 2025 by Deanna McLean Leave a Comment Are you looking to build your website but don’t know where to start? In 2025, do-it-yourself web design will be more accessible than ever, offering cost-effective solutions, complete control over the look and feel of your site, and the chance to learn valuable new skills. However, taking the DIY route requires a time commitment and a willingness to learn. In this post, we’ll provide some helpful tips to guide you through the process, from planning your site’s structure to optimizing it for search engines. We’ll also introduce you to the top tools, like Divi, to build a website independently. Let’s get started. In this section, we’ll outline several key tips to help you create a successful website. These tips cover everything from planning and platform selection to design principles, user experience, content creation, and basic SEO. Following these guidelines, you’ll be well-equipped to build a professional and effective website, even with limited design experience. Before you dive into do-it-yourself web design or choose a platform for your website, you have to start with a solid plan. This crucial step will save you time, prevent potential headaches, and ensure your website does what you want it to do. Think of it as the blueprint for your website. Three key steps are defining your website’s purpose and goals, defining your target audience, and creating a basic outline. First and foremost, define your website’s purpose and goals. Decide your website’s goals by asking yourself a few questions. Do you wish to sell products or services, share your expertise or thoughts, generate leads, or provide information? Clearly defining your purchase will help guide you on the design, content, and overall strategy. Every website should have its niche, so spend time figuring that out before doing anything else. Another important part of the planning stage is defining your ideal customer. Are you looking to target users by demographics (age, location, gender, etc.), interests, or needs? Knowing your audience will help you choose appropriate content and images. Let’s face it: a website targeting younger adults will likely have a different look and feel than one targeting senior citizens. Finally, create a sitemap or basic outline of your site. A sitemap is a visual representation of your website’s structure and hierarchy. It maps out all of the pages on your site and how they connect. Creating a sitemap helps you organize your content, visualize the user experience, and help search engines understand your website’s structure. Take a look at the example sitemap flowchart below. As you can see, it does a good job of showcasing how users will use your site. By starting with a well-defined plan, you’ll set yourself up for success as you progress through the stages of do-it-yourself web design. With a plan in place, the next decision you’ll need to make is choosing the right platform for your site. There are two main options: website builders and content management systems (CMS). Understanding their differences is essential for making the best choice for your needs. Website builders like Wix or Squarespace, are user-friendly platforms designed for beginners with little to no design experience. They offer drag-and-drop interfaces and pre-designed templates and typically serve as an all-in-one platform with hosting included. Content management systems, like WordPress, are more powerful platforms that provide much more flexibility and control over your website. While they may initially require a slightly higher learning curve, they offer significantly more options and the ability to scale as your site grows. While website builders offer a good starting point for simple websites, we strongly recommend WordPress for its versatility and long-term potential. WordPress is an incredibly powerful platform that can create virtually any type of website, from blogs to business websites to e-commerce stores. Its open-source nature, vast community, and extensive library of themes and plugins make it the most flexible and scalable option for do-it-yourself web design. While learning may require more effort, the long-term benefits and control you gain are well worth it. The rest of this post will focus on tips and tricks for building a website with WordPress. Get WordPress Selecting the right hosting provider is an important decision that can directly impact your website’s performance, security, and overall success. A hosting provider stores your website’s files and makes them accessible to visitors. While there are several hosting types, each caters to different needs and budgets. In do-it-yourself web design, picking the right host is one of the most important decisions you can make. You might choose several types of hosting providers, including shared, VPS, managed, and cloud. The one you decide upon depends on the type of website you want now and in the future. To help you decide, here’s a brief overview of each hosting type and who it is best suited to: As the most affordable option, shared hosting shares server resources (RAM, CPU, and storage) with many other websites. It’s suitable for small websites with low to moderate traffic. Remember that performance can be affected if other websites on the server experience a spike in traffic or resource usage. A virtual private server (VPS) provides a virtual server that is separated from other users on the same physical server. It gives you more control over resources and better performance than shared hosting. VPS hosting is a good option for websites that require more resources and server customization. Managed WordPress hosting is specifically optimized for WordPress websites. It includes automatic updates, enhanced security, caching, a content delivery network (CDN), and a staging environment. Managed WordPress hosting is great for WordPress users who want to simplify website management and need enhanced performance. Cloud hosting uses a network of interconnected servers to host your website. It offers excellent scalability, reliability, and uptime. If one server goes down, another can take over, ensuring your website never goes down. There are a few factors to consider when choosing the best hosting provider. First is your website’s size and traffic requirements. Shared hosting might be a good fit for a small website with low traffic. However, as your website grows, you may need to update to a more robust solution, like VPS hosting. This decision is an important one in the process of do-it-yourself web design. You’ll also need to consider your level of technical expertise. VPS may be the way to go if you’re comfortable with server management. However, if you prefer a more hands-off approach where everything is handled for you, managed WordPress hosting is a good option. For those new to do-it-yourself web design, managed hosting can simplify the process. Finally, you have to consider the cost. Shared hosting is the most affordable option, with VPS, cloud, and managed all starting around the same price point. Choosing the right hosting plan for your budget is key for do-it-yourself web design projects. We recommend two good providers based on performance, reliability, customer support, and value for the money: SiteGround and Cloudways. SiteGround is known for its fast servers, customer support, and WordPress-specific features. They offer managed hosting plans with automatic updates, daily backups, a CDN, free SSL, and much more, starting at $2.99 monthly for the first year. After that, you’ll pay around $18 monthly, which is still a great deal for everything you’ll get. Get SiteGround Another great option is Cloudways. They offer managed cloud hosting, allowing you to choose from cloud providers like DigitalOcean, AWS, and Google. They provide a user-friendly interface for managing your server and offer features like caching, staging, robust security features, and the ability to scale your server with the click of a button. If you want a host that will grow with you, Cloudways is the perfect option. Get Cloudways Once you’ve settled on hosting, the next step is to choose a theme. WordPress themes dictate your website’s overall look and feel, influencing its design, layout, and functionality. While WordPress offers an extensive library of free themes, we strongly recommend a premium theme, like Divi, as the ultimate solution for do-it-yourself web design. Divi is more than just a theme; it’s a powerful page builder that allows you to create websites without coding. It offers an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, the Visual Builder, thousands of pre-designed layouts, and extensive customization options, making it the perfect tool for beginners and do-it-yourself web designers. Divi stands out from other WordPress themes for several reasons. Its Visual Builder lets you see your designs in real time as you create them. Drag one of Divi’s 200+ design modules onto the page, adjust its nearly unlimited customization options, and see the results instantly. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ In addition to building your site with design modules, Divi offers Divi Quick Sites, which allows you to create your site from a collection of pre-made starter sites or through an AI-generated site, thanks to Divi AI. Provide a short description of your site, and Divi will build it in minutes. Every Divi Quick Site has all content, web pages, images, global styles, and a menu. It’s a quick way to create a beautiful website in a short amount of time with limited effort. Divi gives you complete control over every aspect of your site’s design. You can customize colors, fonts, spacing, backgrounds, and more. You can also create dynamic templates for your header, footer, blog posts, and more, thanks to Divi’s Theme Builder. This level of customization allows you to create a unique and professional website that reflects your brand, attracts new customers, and encourages them to act. If you plan to sell products and services on your site, you’ll benefit from Divi‘s built-in support for WooCommerce. Divi comes with 20+ Woo modules that allow you to customize every step of the purchase process, from the product to checkout. Combining the power of Visual Builder, Theme Builder, and WooCommerce, you can easily design and build stunning product, shop, and checkout pages. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ By choosing Divi, you’re not just choosing a theme; you’re choosing a complete website-building platform that allows you to create beautiful, functional websites without coding. It’s also one of the most cost-effective solutions you’ll find. For just $89 per year, you can build unlimited Divi websites and manage them through Divi Dash, Divi’s all-in-one site management tool. Divi Dash allows you to manage all your websites, their software, and clients in one convenient location. Get Divi User experience (UX) should be front and center regarding do-it-yourself web design. UX refers to a user’s overall experience while interacting with your website. It involves everything from how easily users can find information to how enjoyable their interactions are. A positive user experience increases engagement, higher conversion rates, and improved customer satisfaction. On the other hand, poor UX can lead to frustration, abandonment, and a negative perception of your brand. Several key factors contribute to a positive UX, so we’ll focus on navigation, mobile responsiveness, and page load speed. Effective navigation is the backbone of a good user experience. It allows users to find what they are looking for easily. Here are some tips for creating clear and intuitive navigation: Mobile users expect a seamless experience on their devices. A responsive website provides just that, making it easy for them to browse your content, navigate your site, and complete desired actions. There are some SEO benefits to responsive design, too. This is because Google uses a mobile-first algorithm that prioritizes mobile-friendly sites when displaying search results. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you are responsible for all aspects of your site. ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ As mentioned, using a good WordPress theme like Divi can give you a tremendous edge in this department. Divi is inherently responsive, meaning any website built with it will automatically adapt to different screen sizes. For even more control, you can use the responsive controls built into Divi to make the necessary design tweaks to make it perfect. Ensuring your site loads fast is another key principle of UX design. Slow loading times can lead to frustration, high bounce rates (users leaving your website), and negatively impacting your search engine rankings. To help you keep your site running smoothly, consider using a fast hosting provider like SiteGround. In addition to hosting, there are a few other ways to ensure your site loads quickly for your users, including: While Divi provides the tools to build a website easily, understanding fundamental design principles is crucial for creating a visually appealing and effective website. This is especially important for do-it-yourself web design, where you take on the entire design process. Design principles use elements like color, typography, and images to create a cohesive look and feel. Stock photo subscriptions can be expensive. Thankfully, there are several free stock image sites you can use to build your website: Divi AI offers a compelling alternative to traditional stock photo platforms. It can generate unique, custom images based on text prompts. This means you can create images that perfectly match your content and brand without relying on generic stock photos. Divi AI can save you time and money while ensuring your website has relevant images and vectors that engage users. One of the best aspects of Divi AI is that there are no limitations on how many images you can generate. This starkly contrasts with other AI generators that provide a credit-based system for creating images. With Divi AI, you can generate as many as you’d like and never worry about running out of credits. Divi AI is offered as a companion product to Divi. You can sign up for access starting at $16.08 per month. Get Divi AI Regarding do-it-yourself web design, the adage “content is king” remains as true as ever. While a visually appealing site is important for attracting visitors, the content keeps them engaged and coming back for more. High-quality, relevant content is the foundation of a successful website, driving traffic, building domain authority, and achieving your online goals. Here’s why high-quality, relevant content is so important: If you’re looking for an easy way to write SEO-optimized content for your website, Divi AI can help. Divi AI is more than just a website and image generator. It can create content, too, making it a great tool for the do-it-yourself web designer. While it doesn’t replace the need for strategic thinking and human oversight, it can be a powerful tool for streamlining content creation and ensuring basic SEO elements are in place. You can provide Divi AI with text prompts related to a topic, including relevant keywords, the tone of writing you’d like, and even the content length. The AI then generates content based on input, incorporating the keywords you specify throughout the text. Divi AI will create headlines, body copy, product descriptions, and more. Another critical aspect of do-it-yourself web design is learning some basic search engine optimization (SEO). When someone searches for information related to your business or website, SEO helps ensure your site appears as high as possible in the search results. Increased visibility can increase your website’s organic (non-paid) traffic. SEO is important for a few reasons. Aside from increased visibility, SEO helps you attract users actively seeking information or products related to your business. Websites that rank high in search results are perceived as more credible and trustworthy, giving customers peace of mind to interact with or purchase from you. SEO is also a very cost-effective form of marketing. Compared to paid advertising, SEO can be a cheaper way to drive traffic to your site over the long term. Here are some fundamental practices that every do-it-yourself web designer should understand: Keyword research involves identifying your target audience’s words and phrases when searching for information related to your business. Tools like Semrush, KWFinder, and SE Ranking can help you find relevant keywords. Understanding what people are searching for allows you to tailor and optimize your content to the right people. On-page optimization involves optimizing elements within your website itself. This includes key areas like title tags, meta descriptions, URLs, and content. During your keyword research, you’ll want to select a primary keyword. Opt for relevant keywords with high search volume and aren’t overly competitive. Choosing a highly competitive keyword can cause you to struggle to rank high in search results. Once you’ve selected a relevant keyword, include it throughout your content (page or post). Include it in the page or post’s title, the URL (permalink), and the meta description. A word of caution, though: avoid keyword stuffing. Using your chosen keyword too often throughout your content can lead to poor placement in SERPs, loss of credibility, and poor user experience. Lastly, assign images to your posts and pages, and add alt text. Another effective way to boost your SEO is through link building. This involves acquiring links from other reputable websites and blogs that link to your website. These links act as votes of confidence and can significantly improve your search engine rankings. Building high-quality backlinks requires effort and strategy, focusing on earning links from relevant and authoritative sources. Thorough testing and feedback are critical before launching your new website, especially for do-it-yourself web design. This step helps identify and fix user experience, functionality, or performance issues. Launching a website without testing is like releasing a product without quality control – it can lead to frustration for users, damage your reputation, and limit your site’s success. Testing allows you to catch and resolve potential issues, including: Several tools can help you test your website, including browser developer tools, Google PageSpeed Insights, GTMetrix, and more. Most modern web browsers like Chrome and Safari have built-in developer tools to help you test responsiveness, spy console errors, and performance. Similarly, tools like Google’s Mobile Friendly test check your site for responsiveness and recommend improvements. Finally, you can use Google Page Speed Insights, GTMetrix, or Pingdom to analyze your website’s performance and provide detailed reports on page load speed and other core web vitals. These tools are invaluable resources for anyone engaged in do-it-yourself web design. Another important part of the testing process is to gather feedback about your website. Ask friends, family, or colleagues to test your website and provide honest feedback. Remember that most of your friends/family will need guidance on what to look for, so provide them with a list of questions to answer. Start with simple questions: Encourage them to be as specific as possible when answering. After all, their perspective can help you identify issues you might have overlooked. Creating a website has never been easier or more rewarding. It’s a chance to express your creativity and gain valuable new skills. From initial planning and choosing the right platform to focusing on user experience (UX) and search engine optimization (SEO), you have access to everything you need to build a strong online presence. Powerful tools like the Divi theme and its innovative AI companion, Divi AI, empower anyone to create professional websites with stunning visuals and SEO-friendly content. With these strategies and resources, you can successfully embrace do-it-yourself web design and quickly build your website. Explore plans, pricing and features.

US stock futures inched higher on Wednesday ahead of crucial consumer inflation data that could reset interest-rate bets, while investors waited to find out whether big bank earnings will live up to high hopes. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) rose roughly 0.2%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) nudged 0.1% higher. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) added about 0.2%, on the heels of a mixed day on Wall Street. The markets are bracing for Wednesday's report on the consumer price index for December, seen as potential pivot point for stocks after wholesale inflation for the month came in cool.

They remain split on whether a cut will come in the back half of this year, with odds of easing in June hovering around 40%. The CPI report, due at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show annual headline inflation at 2.9% and a monthly rate of 0.4%, up from November's levels. A strong reading could restart the selling in stocks and bonds that has marked the start of 2025. Meanwhile, investors are also waiting for quarterly reports from big Wall Street banks to kick off earnings season. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), the country’s largest bank, is expected to report that it notched its second straight year of record profits and show that earnings in the fourth quarter jumped. Updates from BlackRock (BLK), BNY (BK), Citi (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), and Wells Fargo (WFC) are also on the docket.

But ahead of that fun, I thought WEF's annual global risk report that dropped this morning is an interesting read. The top risk is "state-based armed conflict." Other top risks include misinformation and disinformation (good to see Zuck no longer fact-checking at Meta...), extreme weather events, societal polarization, cyber-espionage and warfare.

The rupee extended its recovery for the second straight session and settled with a gain of 13 paise at 86.40 (provisional) against the US dollar on Wednesday, tracking favourable cues from domestic equity markets and softening crude oil prices. - PTI WhatsApp Image 2025-01-15 at 15.38.55.jpeg According to Motilal Oswal Private Wealth (MOPW), Indian markets are expected to remain volatile in the first half of 2025 due to several global and domestic events, including the new Trump administration’s policies, China’s measures to counter trade tariffs and its possible implications for EM currencies, and the upcoming Indian Union budget. These events are anticipated to create uncertainty in the near term. However, as these events unfold and greater clarity emerges, market volatility is expected to subside in the latter half of the year. Despite the recent slowdown in GDP, MOPW remains optimistic about India’s growth due to its macroeconomic stability, supported by significant foreign exchange reserves and a regulated twin deficit. It expects GDP growth to improve compared to the modest growth reported in Q2 FY25. Ashish Shanker, MD & CEO of MOPW says, “The post covid period has been extremely rewarding to equity investors driven by earnings growth, improving macros and domestic inflows into equities. The year 2024 has been no different with broader markets doing extremely well. The mid cap and small cap segment have outperformed the large caps. Gold has also done well as an asset class. The year 2025 will bring its share of uncertainty as the new US president gets sworn in. After years of good performance the US markets also looks tired. This calls for moderation in expectations and a sharp focus on risk management through asset allocation” After tepid corporate earnings and slow GDP growth in Q2FY25, MOPW recommends closely monitoring the upcoming earnings season and GDP growth trajectory.. We expect this trend to reverse and expect large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort. In the longer term, earning growth and stock returns should converge. Considering this, it seems small cap stocks have run up way ahead of earnings growth in most of the segments. MOPW expects this trend to reverse and large caps to do better this year given the valuation comfort.

US producer prices rose at a slower-than-anticipated rate in December, increasing by 0.2% on a month-on-month basis, below 0.4% pace seen in November. Sticky inflation and strength in the labor market could provide the Federal Reserve more headroom to keep interest rates high. Trump’s team is preparing a plan for a gradual imposition of trade tariffs in the coming months, although it was unclear whether the President-elect will follow through on the plan. The plan will involve tariff increases of between 2% to 5% every month, and will give Washington more leverage in trade negotiations, while also preventing a sudden spike in inflation due to the duties. Despite lower PPi, dollar index continues to hold its strength hovering around its two year highs, market participants will keep an eye on the US CPI data scheduled later today. Updates regarding a ceasefire deal yesterday between Israel and Hamas capped some gains for precious metal, any further updates on the same could weigh on prices. Perspective by Ravi Hirwani, Senior Vice-President, Bhailal Amin General Hospital, Vadodara, on expectations from the upcoming Union Budget “The Indian healthcare sector is at a pivotal junction of growth. Certain measures announced by the government can further amplify it. The ecosystem needs to be re-engineered to empower rural counterparts with robust, tech-forward healthcare and medical solutions. Complex ailments like cancer and heart issues burden the ecosystem. There is a shortage of medical specialists, and the need for healthcare infrastructure development in the country’s rural counterpart. The sector needs strategic reforms from both operational and financial perspectives. We request the honorable Finance Minister to increase the allocation by 3% spending of the total GDP to the healthcare sector. Further, the removal or reduction of customs duties on medical devices and cancer-related drugs & devices. The government must consider giving the healthcare sector an infrastructure status that will help private players to reap the benefit and expand operations, especially in smaller cities. An incentivization scheme for expansion in Tier-2 and below cities and the adoption of technology will help the sector flourish in the long run. Hospitals must be allowed to avail the benefits of input tax credit that will help bring a control on treatment costs effectively, thus creating a win-win situation for both industry players and residents alike. The country must aim for dual-dimensional growth by catering for the residents as well as foreign nationals and to address this, we request the government to introduce special packages and measures for foreign nationals seeking to take treatment in India. This will further accentuate the positioning of India as one of the most sought-after destinations for medical tourism.” Smartlink Holdings Ltd has informed the exchange about sanction of the amalgamation scheme between Smartlink Holdings and Synegra EMS Ltd by the National Company Law Tribunal.

Equity markets are expected to sustain their gains at open. Gift Nifty at 23,310 signals a marginal gain of about 50 points at open. However, analysts expect the market to remain volatile and remain under pressure given the unabated selling by foreign portfolio investors. Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Research, Wealth Management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd, said: positive domestic factors include a decline in retail inflation to a four-month low of 5.2 per cent, IIP growth improving in November 2024 to 5.17 per cent and the RBI Governor’s indication of a more flexible rupee policy, contributing to improved market sentiment. “While there is short-term relief in the market, overall weak global cues, a fall in the rupee, low earnings growth and FII outflows continue to weigh on sentiment, keeping the overall outlook cautious,” he added. Read more The last month of the year 2024 was quite eventful even though Indian bond yields continued to trade in a narrow range. INR was the centre of attention as it come under increasing pressure in the latter part of December on back of continuous rise in the dollar index as it surged 2.60% during the month. INR depreciated by 1.32% against the US dollar, touching a lifetime low of 85.82 on an intraday basis before a marginal pullback on RBI intervention led to monthly and yearly closing at 85.61. The dollar index climbed above 108, ending the month at 108.49. December started on an optimistic note for the bond markets as markets started to factor in a higher probability of a policy rate cut in the December 6th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting after the much slower-than-expected Q2 FY25 GDP growth data released on 29th Nov 2024. The MPC kept all the policy rates on hold while RBI reduced the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) by 50bps. The reduction in CRR released Rs. 1.16 lac cr of liquidity in the banking system, which was struggling with tight liquidity on account of heavy RBI intervention in the FX markets along with advance tax and GST outflows. The MPC decision’s to hold policy rates was taken with a 4-2 majority with Dr. Nagesh Kumar and Professor Ram Singh voting for a 25bps cut in the policy repo rate. The monetary policy stance of “Neutral” was retained unanimously. The MPC revised both its Inflation and Growth forecast for FY25, pegging down the GDP forecast at 6.60% from 7.20% earlier and increasing the Inflation forecast to 4.80% for FY25 from 4.50% earlier. RBI remains optimistic on GDP growth in H2FY25 after the negative surprise of Q2. The tone of the policy was balanced with emphasis on durable price stability. There was change of guard at the RBI as Sanjay Malhotra, the incumbent revenue secretary took over as the 26th Governor of RBI replacing Shaktikanta Das who was at the helm for six years. CPI Inflation came in line with expectations at 5.48% with core inflation remaining stead at 3.70%. Food Inflation moderated but remained high at 8.2% YOY. WPI Inflation cooled to 1.90% in November compared to 2.40% in October led by moderation in food prices. WPI has averaged 2.10% so far in this fiscal, compared to a corresponding period average of -1.30% in FY2023. WPI “core” Inflation came in at 0.50% compared to 0.30% in October, though remined below 1% for the fourth consecutive month. Trade deficit hit an all-time high of USD 37.9 bn for November as imports led by gold imports hitting an all-time high of USD 70 bn. Couple of days after the release of the trade data , there were news reports of some error in the data and the government thinking about setting up a team to double check on the data. The current account deficit came in steady at 1.20% of GDP for QE September 24, compared to 1.10% of GDP in the quarter ending June 24. Capital account remained in surplus at USD 30 bn and the overall BOP surplus came in at USD 18.60 bn in QE September from USD 5.20 bn in the previous quarter. The current account deficit is likely to expand in the December quarter. Tax collections remains robust with the third quarter advance tax payment at Rs 3.15 lakh crore, compared with Rs 2.7 lakh crore a year ago. Net direct tax collections (net of refunds) rose 16.45% YOY to INR 15.82 lac crore, which consisted of INR 7.42 lac crore of corporate tax and INR 7.97 lac crore of non-corporate tax collection with STT collections at INR 40,000 crore. The finance ministry, in its economic review for November, expressed optimism regarding a growth rebound in H2 of FY25 by projecting a GDP growth of 6.50% for FY25. The report also mentioned that the “combination of monetary policy stance and macroprudential measures by the central bank may have contributed to the demand slowdown”. This is being seen as putting some pressure on RBI to support growth by reducing rates. Interbank liquidity remained pretty tight even after the reduction in CRR, leading to sharp uptick in money market yields of up to 1 Yr maturity. 3 month maturity CD yields were trading close to 7.40%-7.45% levels, higher by 20-25 bps, compared to the September quarter and the 1 Yr maturity CD’s were trading at 7.65%-7.70%. Bond yields inched higher by 2-3 bps across the curve, with the benchmark 10 Yr bond yield ending the month at 6.76%, up by 2 bps compared to last month’s closing of 6.74%. OIS curve steepened as the 5 Yr OIS yield was higher by 16 bps, ending the month at 6.20%. 1 Yr OIS ended the month at 6.51%, up by 10 bps on the month. FPI flows revived in December with debt flows at USD 1.40 bn, taking the total FPI flows into debt for CY2024 to USD 18 bn. Banking deposit growth has exceeded the credit growth this fiscal with the banking system deposits growing by 7.80%, compared to the credit growth of 7.00% in FY25 so far. Globally, bond remined under pressure with the US Fed delivering a hawkish rate cut as it reduced its forecast of rate cuts for 2025. The US Fed lowered its rate cut forecast for 2025 to 2 rate cuts from 4 earlier and also raised the inflation and the neutral rate forecast. BOJ stood pat on rates but it is expected that they will increase their policy rates twice in 2025. A hawkish Fed coupled with the challenging debt situation in US, sticky inflation amidst robust GDP growth has led to a sharp rise in US bond yields in the last quarter. The benchmark US 10 Yr Bond yield ended the year at 4.57%, up by almost 90 bps over the last three months. The elevated US and global bond yields along with the rise in the dollar index has put pressure on emerging market currencies and bond yields. The dollar index has surged by 6.15% in CY2024 and the INR has depreciated by 2.88% in CY2024. RBI has intervened quite aggressively to contain INR depreciation and RBI is short almost USD 60 bn in the NDF market. India’s foreign currency reserves are down by USD 43 bn from its peak. The pressure on INR due to a strengthening US dollar and expectations of a rebound in the GDP growth in H2FY25 has reduced expectations of policy rate cut from RBI but we continue to expect RBI to cut policy rates starting from February 2025 onwards as Inflation is likely to moderate further. We also expect the external situation to stabilise gradually as markets seems to have factored in a lot of negatives. Bonds will continue to be supported on expectations of monetary easing and we expect yields to continue to drift lower gradually. Retracement in yields from current levels will offer a good opportunity to investors to increase their allocation to fixed income. PGIM India MF Outlook While there are some headwinds in terms of slowing earnings growth, lacklustre capex, INR depreciation and subdued consumption, we reckon some of the above may be transient and will resolve over time. Importantly, corporate debt/GDP are at lows, banks are well capitalised, capital markets are strong and hence there is enough fuel available for long-term productive asset creation which keeps India’s growth story intact. We are mindful of geopolitical actions in terms of tariffs and rate cuts which could result in measures being taken by impacted countries and that needs to be closely monitored. We believe that despite global challenges, India continues to be the fastest-growing economy among major nations, reflecting its resilience. Factors such as sustained domestic economic growth, political stability, prudent reforms, infrastructure investment, healthy corporate finances, ample foreign reserves, controlled twin deficits, stable crude prices, and lower commodity inflation protect India from external shocks and position it for future growth. We are optimistic on investments in high-growth and good-quality companies with a medium to long-term investment horizon. The Market that was The NIFTY 50 declined 2% in December after a flattish November, but gained 8.8% in CY2024. Mid Cap and Small Cap indices outperformed the Large Cap index and were up 1.4% and 0.6% in December and 23.9% each (both Mid Cap and Small Cap indices) in CY2024. Sector-wise, healthcare and realty were the best-performing sectors in the month of December and in 2024. Power, metals and PSU indices declined 7%, 5.4% and 5.2% in December. Rupee was down 1.3% at INR 85.6 vs USD and India 10 Yr yields rose by 6 bps during the month to 6.81%. FPIs bought USD 59 mn of Indian equities in the secondary market, whereas DIIs bought USD 4 bn. FIIs net sold USD 170mn in CY24. On the other hand, DIIs have continued to remain net buyers to the tune of USD 62 bn in CY24. Within DIIs, mutual funds have been the key buyers, contributing to USD 50bn buying. On the economy front, November CPI decelerated to 5.5% YoY from 6.2% in October and back to September levels of 5.5% due to correction in food prices. Sequentially, inflation eased by -15 bps vs. 134 bps hike in the previous month. Core CPI (ex-food and fuel) remained stable at 3.8% as in the last month with sequential pace slowing to 20 bps vs. 59 bps in the last month. WPI also eased to 1.9% in November, compared to 2.4% in October. The index of industrial production (IIP) marginally improved and grew by 3.5% YoY in October vs. growth of 3.1% in September, buoyed by festival-driven demand, reversing a 0.1% contraction in August. Manufacturing/Electricity/Mining registered 4%/2%/1% YoY growth. 18/23 industries advanced YoY. Trade deficit in November further expanded to USD 38 bn (versus USD 27 bn in October and USD 20 bn in September), almost entirely led by a jump in gold imports from USD 7 bn in October to USD 16 bn in November. FY25 April-Nov’24 fiscal deficit touched 52.5% of budgeted estimates (BE) vs. 50.1% of the budgeted estimates same time last year. Direct tax collections are 12% higher YoY with personal income taxes higher by 24% YoY while corporate taxes are down 1% YoY. On the indirect tax side, collections are higher 9% YoY with higher customs growth offsetting weaker GST collections. YTD capex is only 46% of BE and -12% lower than last year. So far, capex has been concentrated in railways (67% of BE and -1% YoY), roads and transport (54% of BE and -16% YoY) while the other primary focus defence is lagging (42% of BE and -16% YoY). A monthly run rate of INR 642 bn so far and with four months to go gives a steep rate of INR 1494 bn (more than double of what has been clocked so far to achieve the budgeted estimates). System credit growth remained weak for the month of November at 10.6% YoY (Oct’24: 11.5% YoY) due to weak retail credit growth of 13.3% YoY (Oct’24: 12.9% YoY) and weak services credit growth of 13% YoY (Oct’24: 12.7% YoY). The weakness in growth is mainly due to stress in unsecured credit. Credit growth has largely converged with deposit growth which stood at 10.7% YoY driven by tightening of risk weights on unsecured loans and NBFC credit. INR4.5t Equity net inflows at record high in CY24 INR264.6b Amount garnered through SIPs at a new high INR66.9t MF industry’s AUM jumps 32% YoY According to Motilal Oswal Fund Folio Report, domestic MFs saw their equity AUM rise for the 11th consecutive year to INR33.4t (+40% YoY) in CY24. AUM growth was fueled by an uptrend in market indices (Nifty: +9% YoY) and higher equity scheme sales (at INR9,120b; +69% YoY). However, redemptions also rose 40% YoY to INR4,645b, leading to a rise in net inflows (more than double YoY) to INR4,475b in CY24 (all-time high) from INR2,063b in CY23. The MF industry’s total AUM increased 32% YoY (INR16.1t) to INR66.9t in CY24, propelled by the growth in equity funds (INR9,537b), liquid funds (INR1,727b), balanced funds (INR1,533b), other ETFs funds (INR1,424b), and income funds (INR954b). Investors continued to park their money in mutual funds, with inflows and contributions in systematic investment plans (SIPs) reaching a new high of INR264.6b in Dec’24 (up 4.5% MoM and 50.2% YoY). NFO Period: 16th January –30th January, 2025 Bengaluru, January 14, 2025: Groww Mutual Fund has introduced the Groww Nifty India Railways PSU ETF, aiming to offer retail investors the opportunity to invest in the Indian Railways ecosystem, a fundamental pillar of India’s infrastructure.

Capitalizing on India’s Growth Story* Indian Railways is critical to the country’s transportation and logistics ecosystem, with a vast network spanning 68,584 km and over 7,325 stations. It facilitates seamless transportation for 6.7 billion passengers annually—equivalent to the world’s population—and handles 27% of India’s freight movement. The sector is undergoing a significant transformation, supported by a record ₹2.52 lakh crore in government capital expenditure for FY 2024-25. Initiatives include the transition to safer, more efficient rolling stock, station upgrades, high-speed rail projects, and the adoption of renewable energy solutions like solar installations, aligning with sustainability goals while reducing operational costs. In adherence to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, Punjab National Bank (PNB), nation’s leading public sector bank, urges its customers to update their “Know Your Customer” (KYC) information by 23.01.2025 to ensure smooth functioning of their accounts. This is applicable only for those customers whose accounts were due for KYC updation as of 30.09.2024. As part of the KYC compliance exercise, PNB customers are requested to provide their updated information like identity proof, address proof, recent photo, PAN/Form 60, income proof, mobile number (if not available) or any other KYC information at any branch. It can also be done through PNB ONE/Internet Banking Services (IBS) or registered e-mail/post to their base branch by 23.01.2025. Failure to update KYC details within the stipulated time may result in restrictions on account operations. “The WPI inflation expectedly rose to 2.4% in December 2024 from 1.9% in November 2024, while printing slightly lower than ICRA’s estimate (+2.6%). The uptick was led by the fuel and power and primary non-food articles, which together accounted for as much as 42 bps of the 48 bps increase in the headline print between these months. The WPI food inflation remained unchanged at 8.9% in December 2024 vis-à-vis November 2024. Among food items, the inflation in vegetables and edible oils remained elevated, printing above the 25% mark in the month. The core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up slightly to a five-month high of 0.7% in December 2024 from 0.5% in November 2024, while remaining below the 1.0%-mark for the fifth consecutive month. The prices of major vegetables, such as tomato, onion and potato, have declined quite sharply on a sequential basis in January 2025 so far. However, the relatively lower weight of vegetables in the WPI vis-à-vis the CPI, would limit the benefits on this account to the headline WPI inflation in the month. Moreover, the import duty hikes on most varieties of edible oil that were undertaken in mid-September 2024, are expected to continue to weigh on the year-on-year (YoY) WPI-food inflation print in January 2025. Consistently outperform Sensex over the past five fiscals1 New Delhi, January 14 2025: The benchmark of equity alternative investment funds (AIFs) investing in unlisted securities achieved a remarkable pooled internal rate of return (IRR) of 21.5% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, according to the second edition of the Crisil-Oister report, ‘No ifs about AIFs 2.0’. Across the past five fiscals, the benchmark outpaced the BSE Sensex Total Return Index (TRI), reaffirming the resilience and importance of private markets in India’s investment landscape. Stage-wise, the benchmark of early-stage funds generated a pooled IRR of 26.9% between fiscals 2013 and 2024, outperforming the BSE 250 Smallcap TRI by 4.29%. Similarly, the benchmark of growth and late-stage funds delivered a robust pooled IRR of 23.6% between fiscals 2015 and 2024, surpassing the BSE 200 TRI by 5.97%. IRR captures both realised and unrealised gains. The distribution to paid-in (DPI) capital ratio shows the realised gains for an investor. The benchmark belonging to the earliest vintage — fiscal 2014 — had a DPI ratio of 1.56, meaning investors received 56% more than their initial investment as of March 2024. Says Sandeep Sinha, Co-CEO, Oister, “This year’s Crisil-Oister report reinforces our long-held belief that private capital is not only participating in India’s growth story but also shaping it. In fiscal 2024, private markets once again demonstrated their ability to outperform and lead through long-term growth and sectoral innovation, setting a benchmark for resilience, scale and innovation.” Shanti Gold International Limited, a Mumbai-based manufacturer of 22kt CZ casting gold jewellery, based on installed production capacity (Source: CARE Report).

According to Matt Hougan, the demand from this companies could impact the Bitcoin market in a positive and significant way. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. Bitwise chief investment officer Matthew Hougan believes that companies adding Bitcoin (BTC) to their balance sheets are no longer an anomaly but a burgeoning megatrend that could transform the crypto market this year. In a recent memo to clients, Hougan highlighted that MicroStrategy has been making the headlines with its aggressive BTC accumulation strategy. The company has acquired approximately 257,000 BTC, more than all the Bitcoin mined last year, and plans to raise an additional $42 billion to continue its purchases. Hougan noted that the trend goes far beyond MicroStrategy. As of Jan. 14, 70 publicly traded companies, including household names like Tesla, Block, and Mercado Libre, hold Bitcoin on their balance sheets. These companies hold 141,302 BTC combined, while private firms such as SpaceX and Block.one have disclosed at least 368 BTC in holdings. According to Hougan, the game-changer is the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) introduction of ASU 2023-08. This rule allows publicly traded companies to mark Bitcoin holdings to market value, enabling them to record profits when Bitcoin’s price rises. Previously, Bitcoin was treated as an “intangible asset,” forcing companies to write down its value if the price fell but not allowing them to recognize gains when it increased. With reputational risks declining and the accounting landscape more favorable, Hougan predicts an explosion in the number of companies buying Bitcoin. He estimates that the current count of 70 could grow to hundreds, even thousands, in the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, Hougan argues that companies buy Bitcoin for the same reasons individuals do. Some see it as a hedge against dollar depreciation, others as a speculative asset to boost stock prices, and others as a signal of innovation to attract customers and talent. While motivations vary, he believes the influx of corporate demand has the potential to drive Bitcoin prices significantly higher, particularly as major players like Meta and others contemplate entry. Hougan concludes the document by saying that retail investors don’t need to understand why every company is buying Bitcoin. Instead, they should ask themselves where this demand is heading and what it means for the market.

Title: The Best Wireless Earbuds, Tested For Months By Our Tech Editor

Time Published: 2025-01-14T21:03:30Z
Full Content:
As the tech editor at Forbes Vetted, wireless earbuds need to tick a few boxes to earn my recommendation: They need to have great sound, stellar noise cancellation, a long battery life and intuitive controls. And since they always come with a carrying case, they should be portable and easy to locate if you happen to lose them around your home or office. The catch? After testing 19 pairs over several months, I found that there’s no one-size-fits-all best wireless earbud for everyone (more on that below). My personal top pick is the Bose QuietComfort Ultra wireless earbuds, which combine incredible audio quality and noise cancellation—by far the best of all the pairs I tested. But, they’re not going to be everyone’s favorite for a couple of reasons. abc The Bose are pricey, and in addition to the almost-$300 cost, you have to pay an extra $49 if you want a wireless charging case. Further, the battery drains after just a few hours. So if you’re not keen on spending hundreds on a pair of earbuds or you value battery life as a top priority, there are plenty of other worthy options. My top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, can get you pretty great sound for less than $80. Others, like the premium Denon PerL Pros, use AI to enhance audio based on your ear shape. Based on rigorous testing with 19 sets over several months, here are my picks for the best wireless earbuds for 2025. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 6 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 8.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The noise canceling of the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds is unparalleled. During my testing, there were multiple times that I didn’t hear my husband approach until he tapped my shoulder. Subway rides also were also muted and I could enjoy reading my Kindle Paperwhite in near silence, quite a feat considering how screechy New York City public transit can be. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds feature an oval-shaped eartip for ergonomic comfort. While the equalizer adjustment controls aren’t too detailed (you can change the earbuds’ frequencies for bass, mids and trebles for up to six levels in either direction), they get the job done, and it’s not fully necessary to adjust them at all. I found myself only tweaking them a bit to enhance the bass, since the audio quality is so good out of the box. And if you find yourself swapping between your laptop and phone regularly, they support multipoint connectivity. All said, there are a couple drawbacks that left me less than enthused. For one, the battery life is relatively short; I wore them on a transcontinental flight and used them in the airport, thinking I would get a full six hours with ANC on—but I heard the dreaded low battery notification mid-flight. It’s not the end of the world—a quick 15-minute charge gets you another two hours in a pinch—but it’s a big enough drawback that if you want long-lasting earbuds, look elsewhere. Secondly, the case is a bulky beast that does not offer wireless charging, and you need to pay an additional $49 for a wireless charging case. I personally find this insulting, considering the already-costly $299 sticker price. Ultimately, I chose Bose’s QuietComfort Ultras as my top choice based solely on sound quality, and yes, it’s that good. Finally to clarify, the brand has wireless headphones with the same name, so keep this in mind when shopping to avoid confusion. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 44 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IP55 | Drivers: 10.4 mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: The OnePlus Buds 3 feel like a dark horse winner as my best budget pick, but after extensive testing, they’re truly the best if you’re mindful of your spending. The earbuds come with touch controls, which is mostly fine, though during testing I learned the hard way not to apply a lot of pressure. If you do, the earbuds shift in your ear canal. They won’t fall out–they were quite secure in my ear–but it can be annoying. A simple tap or gentle long press is all you need to control them. If you’re not an iPhone or OnePlus phone user, then the app may also give you pause. The Hey Melody app for Android users doesn’t get as deep into the frequency weeds as other earbud apps, like the Denon PerL Pros. Still, it does a solid job of delivering the basics, including four listening profiles and the ability to create a custom profile via five different frequency settings. The OnePlus Buds 3 have a sleek design that fit snugly and comfortably in my ears. Looking past the app, though, the price/value ratio on these earbuds wowed me. The audio felt detailed and rich, especially once I turned on OnePlus 3D Audio (the brand’s version of spatial audio). I also completed a sound test profile to help finesse my listening experience, which enhanced some areas that I felt were lacking. They simply have no right to sound as good as they do, with some of the details in the mids layering nicely compared with other competitors in this price range. Could the audio be better? Absolutely—the bass in particular could be stronger. But at that point, you’re looking at spending three figures on the Bose or the Denons to get that high-quality deep bass. These earbuds cost around $70, and for the price, you get pretty darn good audio. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 26 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP57 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro wireless earbuds don’t offer the single best audio quality, and the ANC isn’t the absolute best on the market. But when I’m heading into the subway, or when I’m about to hop on a plane, they’re the pair I always take with me. I’ve had them since July’s Samsung Unpacked, and after testing them for several months with my Android device, they’re my top pick for the category because they represent the best combination of ANC, audio quality and more for Android users. Yes, they mimic the Apple AirPods’ design—that’s something the company caught flack for at the initial launch. But that design wears comfortably in my ears and I can keep them in for long hours without my ears feeling itchy, a problem I experience with most wireless earbuds. The Samsung Buds 3 Pros look similar in design to the Apple AirPods, but they're built for Android ... [+] users. Go to the app to adjust your ANC levels. There you’ll also find a few audio presets, including balanced, dynamic and bass boost. Personally, I found dynamic to be the most effective, but your mileage and preferences may vary. Other useful features include 360 audio which aims to place you in the middle of the action, and you can also turn on head-tracking if that suits you. Songs like Florence and the Machine’s “King” and “Cosmic Love” sounded rich and detailed. I typically test audio for the balance of the harp in the latter against the rest of the instrumentals. While further into the song, the harp was hard to distinguish, it’s still good enough for most needs. With many earbuds offering touch controls, the physical buttons feel like a boon in a sea of accidental touches, something that I’ve had happen more times thanks to my bushy hair. I’ve also felt the advertised battery life—around 7 hours—is good. Because they pair best with Samsung phones and I use the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I can open the settings and see the battery life at a glance from the Bluetooth display. But that leads to another caveat: Android versus iOS. If you have an Android phone, particularly a Samsung device, these earbuds integrate just fine. If you have iOS, though, you may have a problem, as Apple users don’t have access some of the Wear app integrations—and to an extent, this affects Google Pixel users, too. But if you have an Android phone—and ideally a Samsung—these are the earbuds to get. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 20 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: Yes | Waterproof rating: IP54 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: While the AirPods Pro 2 provide high fidelity audio and the new Hearing Aid features, if you don’t want all the extras, the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC (active noise cancellation) should be at the top of your list. They feature Apple’s signature sleek design, but what you don’t get is the silicone ear tips (which tend to deliver a more secure fit). If you’re not a jogger or if you’re not worried about an adjustable fit, this won’t matter much since I found they stayed firmly in my ears during my testing, despite my initial fear that they would fall out. One of my biggest surprises during testing was just how good the audio quality is despite the modest price tag. Could they sound better? Probably. But I pitted them against two earbuds—the Denon PerL Pros and the Bowers & Wilkins Pi8s—and I struggled to hear any audio quality differences among the three. That speaks pretty well about the audio fidelity that these affordable AirPods can output. It wasn’t until I tested this pair on Florence and The Machine’s “Cosmic Love” that I spotted some subtle differences in the mids and basses. Even then, if you’re not actively listening for audio details, you’re probably not going to notice. You won't find silicone ear tips on the Apple AirPods 4 With ANC. The ANC on them is also surprisingly good, but again, you’re not getting those silicone ear tips so don’t expect the best ANC that Apple has to offer. Apple’s ANC has a mode called Conversation Awareness that automatically adjusts so you can hear what’s going on around you when it detects that you’re talking to someone. It was great when I worked at home and wanted to tune out the schoolchildren in my neighborhood. But there were moments when I was listening to music and it registered my husband speaking with his parents in the same room and randomly subdued my audio when it registered that as a conversation. As for its battery life, it’s on par with Apple’s claim of four hours with ANC on, based on my testing. It’s not the best by far, but if you’re a casual listener, odds are you won’t be using them for more than four hours at a time, anyway. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 40 hours (including case) | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 10mm | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: I’ve tested countless earbuds, but it’s not every day that I find a pair whose sound sets a new bar for audio quality. That’s exactly what happened when I tried the Denon PerL Pro wireless earbuds. Yes, they look like giant discs and feel a little unwieldy in my ears. But in my estimation, the audio quality is comparable products in the $300 price range. The Denon PerL Pros have a unique build. Interestingly, Denon refers to the earbuds’ ANC as the Immersion mode, and the earbuds “scan” your ears to customize the way it interacts with your ears. It sounds cool, and if you don’t want more control over your personalization, you can, but I don’t recommend it—the scan works just fine, and it’s designed for audiophiles that want to tinker with every single frequency. Once I’d completed the scan and switched to this mode, my audio was something of a mixed bag. Ashnikko’s songs sounded bass-heavy, while Florence and the Machine’s catalogue sounded incredible. I could hear every layer with clarity, even with the bass feeling overpowered during “Dog Days Are Over.” I also cross-tested with two other Florence songs, “King” and “Cosmic Love,” and found that for once I could clearly hear the bass on the former and every pluck of the harp on the latter. It was simply delightful. Remember when I mentioned they look unwieldy in my ears? They dwarf my ears when worn. However, there are some minor caveats to consider before splurging on these. They look like giant discs stuffed into your ears, and for those who thrive on subtlety and sleekness, that may be off-putting. The other issue is the “Immersion” ANC mode: You can’t control it. I’ve found in my travels that the ANC could be improved, as it’s not the strongest compared to the Bose QuietComfort Ultras or even the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Best Buy Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: 10 hours (without ANC); 40 hours with case | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: Unknown | Noise-canceling: Yes Best for: Skip if: When the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds launched, I took them on two flights to test them for my full-length review. Even after returning home, I found myself skipping my SteelSeries Arctis Nova Pro wireless headset in favor of these earbuds. SteelSeries nailed the comfort level right off the bat, offering three ear tips sizes to suit most needs, and the design fits snugly in my ear. Another key feature I appreciate is the physical button controls. It may sound surprising considering the industry shift to touch controls, but it’s a huge factor on why I keep coming back to these as my main gaming headset. With them, there are no accidental touches if you brush your hair behind your ear during gaming. SteelSeries products, including the Arctis GameBuds, offer a special EQ software called Sonar. Typically installed on a PC, in this case, it’s in the form of an app. This creates a caveat for gamers, though: no multipoint connectivity. Still, I appreciate that I can use either Bluetooth or 2.4GHz (with a dongle) to connect to my devices, including my beloved Nintendo Switch. The SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds feature physical buttons. The Arctis’ audio for music is quite good, but its real claim to fame is its gaming audio. You get spatial audio for gaming in a compact, portable package. It’s good enough that when battling in Far Cry 6, I can still hear movements clearly on one earbud versus the other. I can also hear the direction enemies move from—that’s very important as a gamer, and props to SteelSeries for factoring it into this compact package. As earbuds, this pick doesn’t quite rival the best gaming headsets if you want a truly immersive experience. Also, the battery life is underwhelming at 10 hours, as opposed to gaming headsets that can pack in 20 hours—and as much as 300 hours—of use before needing a recharge. But in the realm of wireless earbuds, 10 hours is impressive, especially since most of the picks on my list can only go up to six or eight hours before requiring a recharge. All in all, given their price and the audio quality, the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds are an incredible product that I find myself using almost daily. A quick note: If you plan on using these with your PlayStation, you’ll want the PlayStation model. It’s an important distinction to help get the most out of the gaming features available on these earbuds. Amazon Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 7.5 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm (unconfirmed) | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: The Bose Ultra Open earbuds combine two features that are essential to runners: A comfortable, nonslip fit for hours of comfortable wear, and an open audio environment that lets you hear the world around you through your music. The earbuds clip onto your ear helix (you know, the outer, curved part of your ear) so you can wear them for hours in comfort. While I didn’t personally test this pair, they were (and continue to be) a top contender chosen by Forbes executive editor Dave Johnson, who has extensive experience testing, writing and editing in the tech world. “They are comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and they stay doggedly affixed to my ear no matter what I’m doing,” he says, adding that he uses them regularly in his workout routines. “Traditional earbuds, like the Apple AirPods Pro, tend to work themselves loose when I’m working out at the gym and I always need to fiddle with them to keep them from falling out while jogging on the treadmill. That’s no longer a problem with the Ultra Open.” That said, the audio is where the Opens begin to lose some of their appeal, and for audiophiles, you’ll want to decide whether it’s worth that ever-so-slight downgrade. During testing, the earbuds held up really well against the competition. “The sound is rich and full, with excellent spatial audio, and I can still feel the bass even though a lot of it is just radiated away into the air around my ears,” shares Johnson. But, it’s important to note that the bass doesn’t quite hit the same as compared with other earbuds, especially when compared to its sibling, the Bose QuietComfort Ultras. The battery life is also surprisingly stellar for a first-gen design, which wowed our testers. “I think Bose expects you to just leave these things clipped to your ears all day long, and the respectable battery life lets you do that,” says Johnson. He regularly enjoys more than 7 hours of continuous runtime with spatial audio off (it dropped to around 4.5 hours with spatial audio on). And, if you’re running low on battery, the accompanying case gets him an additional two full charges, too. Be sure to take a look at the new chilled lilac color, a Bose website exclusive; if I had to relive my life, I would have sprung for those pastel hues. Soundcore Forbes Vetted Forbes Vetted ratings are based on thorough evaluations by our editorial team to help you choose the best products with confidence. Battery life: Up to 8 hours | Wireless charging case: No | Waterproof rating: IPX4 | Drivers: 12mm | Noise-canceling: No Best for: Skip if: This year at CES—an annual, world-renown tech exhibition—an Anker PR rep handed me this pair of Soundcore AeroClips, telling me they had just launched and to take them for a spin. An offshoot to Anker, Soundcore is a budget-friendly line that promises to deliver big sound for less. I tossed them on my ears and essentially wore them nonstop for a few days, wearing out the eight-hour battery life to get a sense of how they performed. The Soundcore AeroClips are comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their ... [+] bulk. I was tickled pink by how delightful I found these open ear wireless earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long hours without feeling bogged down by their bulk, which was surprising; unlike the Bose Ultra Opens, which are my “best open ear” pick, the AeroClips “clip” onto your ear helix (although, I also felt they rested on my ears a bit). I did note that sometimes I needed to adjust them with my glasses on, but that wasn’t the end of the world. Bose still takes the cake in comfort, but I didn’t mind wearing these for many hours. I was also very pleasantly surprised with the audio on these, but there’s a caveat: Soundcore offers a Soundcore Signature preset that I find abysmal at best. As a classically trained musician, I believe music should be balanced and clear so you feel like you’re smack dab in the action; too much bass, and it gets muddy, whereas an emphasis on treble frequencies can leave your audio sounding tinny. The Signature preset across a few Soundcore models varies greatly, and on the AeroClips, there was virtually no balance whatsoever. But, not all is lost here. I found the cinematic sound I sought with the Classical preset, which is the one I would recommend using. if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget, this pair is hard to beat. Ultimately, open ear wireless earbuds at this price shouldn’t sound this good, but Soundcore pulled it off—and kudos to them, because I’m impressed. Soundcore put a lot of thought and consideration into the AeroClips, and it shows in these earbuds. You’ll have to wait a bit to get them as they begin shipping January 22, but if you’re looking for big sound on a small budget—specifically if you want buds to use while running in the park , letting you listen to audio while also hearing outside noises—this pair is hard to beat. While my top picks represent some of the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, many others didn’t quite make the cut. Below are 11 more models I tested, plus reasons why they didn’t earn a spot on this list. Anker Soundcore C40i ($90 at Amazon): I wanted to love the Soundcore C40i wireless earbuds, and if budget is your priority for open ear wireless earbuds, these are the pick for you. But I found the audio quality to be lacking. It’s good enough for runs and general gym activities, but if you spend an extra $30 for the AeroClips (which made it on this list), your ears will thank you. OnePlus Buds 3 Pro ($99 at Amazon): The OnePlus Buds 3 Pros are pretty darn good, but they don’t fit into any specific category. Like my top budget pick, the OnePlus Buds 3, they use the Melody app if you’re not a OnePlus or iPhone user, but it’s still a worthwhile pick. That said, if you’re a OnePlus user, it’s worth the upgrade to the Buds 3 Pro over the Buds 3. Audio-Technica ATH-CKS50TW2 ($149 at Amazon): The ATH-CKS50TW2 earbuds excel at one thing: battery life. They can last up to 15 hours with ANC on, 25 without, and you get an extra 40 hours with the charging case. The audio, however, felt a little too muddy for my taste despite fiddling with the EQ. It’s still pretty darn good though, and most users will be happy with this pair. It’s also hard to argue with another huge boon to their build: physical buttons, which are quickly becoming a relic in earbud designs—I personally love this choice. Bowers & Wilkins Pi8 ($320 at Amazon): I wanted to love these earbuds—they were on par with the Denon PerL Pros during my testing. However, both managing editor Emmy Favilla and I both had connectivity issues with two separate review units during our testing. For the price—the highest of any I tested at $399—that’s unacceptable. If you can stomach that, you may have to put them back in the case once or twice before they work in your ears, then they’re a good choice. Sony LinkBuds ($178 at Amazon): These were also a near miss. They feature a new, innovative design with ear tips shaped like a comma. However, I found them uncomfortable in my ears even after adjusting and swapping ear tips multiple times. Despite deep testing the audio features, I found the audio quality lacking, and I had concerns over the case’s longevity; it felt cheaply built. Simply put, while they’d be great for teens, as an audiophile, I wasn’t a fan. JLab GoPop ANC ($30 at Walmart): I loved these earbuds. They’re comfortable to wear for long periods, and the charging case is tiny and features a built-in charging cable. My problem? At the loudest, they’re not very loud in my ears, and many of the songs I listened to lacked bass even with the bass boost turn on. Still, for the price, these would be a great choice for teens who want decent audio without a sky-high price tag. JLab JBuds Mini ($40 at Amazon): For their tiny size, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the power behind the JLab JBuds Mini Wireless Earbuds. That said, I found that I needed the largest size for one of my ears, otherwise the earbud felt too loose; your mileage may vary, and they may not fit if you have larger ears. They also don’t come with ANC—only passive noise cancellation. I still had to turn the earbuds down to hear my husband during walks in the local park, so while not the strongest, it does reduce some sound. One thing to note: During testing, I noted that on windy days, the Bluetooth connectivity frequently cut out, which is why they didn’t make my best budget pick. Baseus M2 (out of stock): The Baseus M2s are really comfortable in the ears and for the price, the ANC is surprisingly very effective. I found myself tossing these in my ears fairly often at my desk to tune out the school next door to my house over others due to how effective it was. However, the audio for music doesn’t quite match up to its competitors. It’s great for podcasts and audiobooks, though, and its price is very attractive. Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro ($199 at Amazon): During testing, Favilla noted the Google Pixel Buds 2 Pro felt comfortable to wear over long periods of time, and taking calls felt seamless. The sound quality is on par with the previous generation, and they paired almost instantly with a Google Pixel 7 Pro. Google did a stellar job upgrading its ANC from the previous generation, too. Marshall Motif II ANC ($150 at Amazon): The Motif II ANC earbuds sound pretty great, and packs punchy basses and high trebles for an enjoyable listening experience. But upon further testing, the noise canceling and construction could be improved. Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 ($200 at Best Buy): The Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 earbuds have some of the best ANC in the business, with a solid audio profile, to boot. They’re so good they nearly eliminate airplane engines in flight. Unfortunately, Jabra announced this generation is the last in its consumer line it will produce. More concerning, Jabra only guaranteed updates for two years. With most earbuds lasting much longer than that, I can’t fully recommend a short-lived product. To find the best wireless earbuds on the market, I put over a dozen pairs to the test, narrowing down options to top-rated brands like Bose, Sony and more. From there, I put my shortlist to the test. The best wireless earbuds should feel sturdily built, with a sleek design that feels comfortable in your ears. After all, if you’re wearing them for an extended period of time, you shouldn't feel any discomfort. I also evaluated the design based on wireless charging versus wired only, case bulk and more. No matter what genre you’re listening to, your audio quality should have a reasonable balance of base, mids and treble frequencies. None of these frequencies should sound muddled or distorted during listening sessions, and so I looked for crystal clear clarity and smoothness amongst the frequencies. I cross-checked audio quality in each pair of wireless earbuds across a variety of songs, and I considered whether ANC and spatial audio changed the overall sound quality. Some of the genres that I listen to include alternative, rock, classical, audiobooks/podcasts and more. Specifically, some of the songs I tested each pair of wireless earbuds include: When you’re listening to your music, you want to be able to listen for hours without interruptions. I tested these earbuds for 30 minutes each, logging battery light percentage at the beginning and at the end. I also cross tested this with the ANC on versus off to get a sense of whether each pair lived up to its claims. I’ve been involved in tech journalism for over five years, including more than a year as the consumer tech and electronics editor at Forbes Vetted. In addition to working with home entertainment, such as testing the best gaming TVs and the best TVs for bright rooms, I have also tested most of the latest smart wearables currently on the market, from the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses to the SteelSeries Arctis Nova GameBuds and more. In my time testing wireless earbuds, I focus on aspects of interest to everyone, from casual folks who want a no-frills set of earbuds for occasional listening to serious audiophiles who want to enjoy every single guitar strum. For this story, I focused on various features each pair of wireless earbuds offered as they applied to work, travel and more everyday scenarios. I evaluated a slew of features on each pair, including audio quality, software integrations, ANC and more. I also made sure to test each earbuds for a minimum of 10 hours to dive into the finer details each pair offered. I also carefully reviewed the software for each pair of wireless earbuds offered to determine which had the best balance of features and price. When I’m not testing the latest audio equipment, I’ve spent plenty of time testing the newest mobile devices. I’ve deep-dived into the Apple ecosystem with the iPhone 16 Pro and reviewed plenty of Android devices, including the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and the Google Pixel 8. Most recently, I tested the Google Pixel 9 Pro. I added two new recommendations: the Anker Soundcore AeroClip earbuds as the best budget open ear pick and the SteelSeries Arctis GameBuds as the best gaming earbuds. I also added notes on three other contenders that didn’t quite make the cut.

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting 3,620 jobs Another day, another round of big changes at Meta: The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is cutting roughly 5% of its workforce — or 3,620 employees — as it looks to “move out low-performers faster,” according to a memo from CEO Mark Zuckerberg that was obtained by Bloomberg on Tuesday. Zuckerberg said the cuts are coming after he “decided to raise the bar” on performance” at his company. “This is going to be an intense year, and I want to make sure we have the best people on our teams,” Zuckerberg said. The 40-year-old Meta founder said employees who are laid off will be notified starting on February 10. Meta’s headcount at the end of September, the most recent period data is available for, was 72,404. Zuckerberg’s memo on the job cuts adds to a busy start to 2025 for the company. Notably, Meta ended its third-party fact checking operation last week, with Zuckerberg saying the move was about “restoring free expression” on Facebook and Instagram, where he said the fact checkers had made “too many mistakes” in recent years. Meta will be rolling out a new feature similar to X’s Community Notes, Zuckerberg said. On Friday, Zuckerberg compared the fact checking operation to George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984,” while appearing on the Joe Rogan podcast. He added the Biden Administration “basically pushed” the company to censor certain topics, including what the government felt was COVID-19 misinformation. And in other Meta news, the company announced it was ending its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs on Friday. Meta’s stock price is up 1.1% on the year to $596.27 per share.

Title: TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX): Buzzing on Hyve

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We came across a bullish thesis on TD Synnex Corp. (NYSE:SNX) on ValueInvestorsClub by RugPull1995. In this article, we will summarize the bulls’ thesis on SNX. The company’s shares were trading at $115.50 when this thesis was published, vs. the closing price of $132.84 on Jan 13. A technical analyst using a cloud-based analytics dashboard for financial services. SNX operates as a distributor and solutions aggregator for the information technology (IT) ecosystem. The company offers personal computing devices and peripherals, mobile phones and accessories, printers, supplies, and endpoint technology software; and data center technologies, such as hybrid cloud, security, storage, networking, servers, technology software, and converged and hyper-converged infrastructure. It also provides systems design and rack integration, build-to-order, and configure-to-order assembly. SNX is the leading IT distributor in North America and Europe, with a global market share of 16%. While growth in this segment has stalled, Hyve, a business that manufactures servers, storage and networking equipment for hyperscalers, has tremendous potential. 40% of Hyve’s business comes from Meta and there is potential to strike a deal with Oracle in the next year. The cloud capex for Meta and Oracle are projected to be 13% and 32% from 2024 to 2027 and will have a direct bearing on Hyve’s business. With increasing geopolitical tensions in Taiwan, it provides more business opportunities as mega players like Meta, Microsoft and Amazon look to build onshore capabilities. This segment offers a higher margin and a better growth prospect compared to the distribution segment. The core business is also expected to witness an up-cycle from 2025. The demand for PCs during Covid surged due to work-from-home requirements. The average life of these PCs is 5 years, making 2025 the terminal year that would prompt users to buy new PCs. The fundamental logic can be applied to servers, network equipment and storage as well but with a slightly wider timeline i.e. 2020-2022. The stock trades at 10x its 2024 EPS and 8x based on its 2025 EPS estimates. Separately valuing Hyve at 10.5x its EBIT multiple and 9x for SNX’s other business yields a fair value of $157, implying a potential 19% upside with low risk. While we acknowledge the potential of SNX as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than SNX but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Pokémon TCG Is In A Bad Situation, And The Pokémon Company Has To Step Up
URL: https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920
Time Published: 2025-01-14T15:35:00Z
Full Content:
Update: 1/15/2025, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a statement from The Pokémon Company International regarding this situation, which is reproduced in full below. In it, the company states that it is attempting to print more cards for the sniped sets, as well as promising restocks on the Pokémon Center websites in the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The original story follows below, with the statement added at the bottom. The Pokémon trading card game (PTCG) is in a really big mess. And once again, it’s because it has become too popular for its own good. If you were hoping to pick up some product from the forthcoming Prismatic Evolutions special sets, well, good luck to you. And March’s just-announced Journey Together set? Pre-orders sold out in literal seconds. Whether it’s because of scalpers, a sudden new tidal wave of interest via Pokémon TCG Pocket, or evil space spiders, The Pokémon Company International desperately needs to react, and fast. I first noticed something was wrong the day that Prismatic Evolutions went up for pre-order on the Pokémon Center website. The official Pokémon online store, both in the UK and the U.S., was acting strangely: the new special set (so-called because it will be released in boxed and tinned products throughout 2025, but not be sold as individual booster packs) was marked as “UNAVAILABLE” the moment it was put in the store. After a while, “UNAVAILABLE” switched to “SOLD OUT,” and that was that. Somehow, despite never being possible to buy, it was gone. The very same thing happened at the end of last week with the announcement of March’s next full set, Journey Together. At this point, it has become very apparent something is going horribly wrong. For reasons too dull to get into, about a year-and-a-half ago, I got into the habit of refreshing the Pokémon Center websites for the UK and the U.S. a pretty troubling number of times a day. This reflex stuck and has proven useful in the long time since, helping me get the scoop on new products, and indeed ensuring I could buy myself the special Pokémon Center version of each set’s Elite Trainer Box (ETB), which invariably sold very quickly. So it is that I tend to notice new product on the site long before press releases go out, and being in the UK, often get the jump on what will be added to the North American site later the same day. And so it was that I discovered Prismatic Evolutions was on sale far before any official announcements, and indeed that it was not possible to buy. I contacted TPCi at the time—November 6—via their UK PR department (TPCi is notoriously difficult to get in touch with), with an incredibly innocuous question about how the products appeared to be sold out before ever actually being available. Was it a glitch? Was it unprecedented demand? Either way, you’d imagine the company would like to make it clear to customers. But instead, I received a response that read, “Pokémon does not have any additional information to share on the below.” Perplexed, I left it, because—as I say—I’m aware how hard it is to get any information from TPCi, and even a “no comment” was a rare treat. Then, come January 9, the same thing happened again. Journey Together had yet to be officially acknowledged as a set by TPCi, but there it was on the Pokémon Center. Four products—the 36-pack booster box, the ETB, a six-pack booster bundle, and individual packs—all listed as available to buy on the “New Releases” page of the store, but all marked as “UNAVAILABLE” when you clicked through. Weirder, I noticed this time, was that it didn’t say it was unavailable immediately, but rather after the tiniest fraction of a second. For that split-second before, the usual, yellow “ADD TO BASKET” button would flicker. I tried a bunch of times to see if I could click on it before it changed, eventually succeeded, but received only a strange error message. And then, after about an hour, the New Releases page updated the products to be “SOLD OUT,” and even more tellingly, a front page giant banner for the new product that was latterly added to the site was entirely removed. So, obviously, I got in touch with Pokémon’s UK PR to ask what was happening, but despite repeated attempts over the last five days, haven’t heard anything back. So what’s going on? Well, without a response from TPCi, it’s hard to be certain. But it makes sense to assume it’s directly the fault of bots and scalpers, looking to resell unopened products at vastly inflated prices. Right now, a $60 ETB of Prismatic Evolutions has a resale market price of $400, while others are selling their pre-orders of Journey Together ETBs on eBay for $150+. To be clear, these are the sorts of items that would usually be stood in huge piles in your local card store, and easily available in Target and Walmart. What’s brought this about is likely more complicated. Prismatic Evolutions is one of those sets, like 2023's 151, that will bring lots of people to the hobby. It’s an Eevee-based set, and it’s had a lot of buzz. That’s one factor. Then there’s Pokémon TCG Pocket, which has been a phenomenon, drawing in tens of millions of players, inevitably a gateway for vast numbers to want to collect the physical cards too. And, of course, there’s momentum. Once prices start going up, more people try to take advantage of those increases, buying up stock to increase scarcity, driving prices up further, and so on. We’re definitely in that vicious loop right now. You might say we’ve been here before, first in 2016 when Pokémon GO caused a vast amount of new interest in the TCG, and then to the most outlandish degree in 2020 and 2021, when Logan Paul sparked a wild surge in prices after paying $150,000 for a Base Set Charizard, leading to a lockdown-driven crazy spike in interest in classic cards. However, what marks this situation as different is the cards it involves. Both previous spikes were about classic cards, seeing the prices of old collections increasing exponentially, and in many cases, still maintaining that value today. But in both situations, while newer sets certainly proved a lot more popular, they were still widely available. The only exception to this would be Japan’s Clay Burst set that in 2023 astonishingly caused Japan to sell out of all Pokémon cards, but the Iono card responsible didn’t cause anything similar in the rest of the world when it was later released in English. The reason it’s so different this time is that it’s affecting the brand-new sets, and that’s an issue for two important reasons. Firstly, it breaks the entire hobby for regular people. If you’re someone (like me) who tries to pick up an ETB and then buys a bunch of loose packs here and there, you’re now just shit out of luck. Casual collectors can’t try to get a few nice cards for their binders. Kids looking to spend their allowance on a $5 pack will go home disappointed. That really sucks, and it’s going to badly affect the reputation of the game. And secondly, the game. These cards, while often bought in the gambling-lite hope of pulling a rare card, actually exist to be the playing cards for a massively popular game. And if you can’t buy the new sets at sensible prices, you can’t keep up with the meta, can’t redesign your decks, and just can’t join in anymore. There are millions of people, kids and adults, who meet up every week for clubs, who will be negatively affected by this sudden inability to buy anything new. (Browsing my usual online store right now, there’s not a single item from the last three full sets I can buy right now.) As I was preparing this article, I noticed that the astonishingly popular Pokémon YouTuber, “PokeRev,” uploaded a video last night, commenting on very similar problems. With almost 3 million followers, the streamer who most know as “Rev,” real name Nick, has a lot of reach. He sources his cards as a retailer, rather than a customer, invariably receiving crates of stock of each product, which is opened daily on his channel, and almost always given away to viewers. As such, he tends to get new sets before they’re available to buy, and presumably to the frustration of TPCi, opens hundreds of packs long before their shelf date. (Pokémon PR in the U.S. very generously sends me advance sample packs of each new set, so I can write about them on Kotaku, and Nick almost always gets his product before even these arrive.) But in his most recent video, PokeRev is unusually candid, almost emotional, as he discusses the lack of availability of recent sets. Stating it began with November’s set, Surging Sparks, he explains how the resale prices of brand new cards have gone through the roof, as availability in stores has become minimal. And that things have become so extreme at this point, that as he tore into Prismatic Evolutions in the last few days, he’s been feeling a sense of guilt, that he knows his viewers aren’t going to be able to buy it for themselves. (Rev plans to give all his bulk to local card stores, on top of giving product away to viewers.) I’m certain PokeRev’s speaking out is likely to cause more consternation within TPCi than my coverage, and I imagine others will jump on board too, so hopefully we might finally see the company pushed into addressing this issue. Because, for them, selling out is selling out, whether it’s bots or kids buying the cards. The only way to make them care is reputationally. (And please, please don’t pay the scalp prices—that motivates the situation and ensures it can’t improve.) In the meantime, if you were hoping to enjoy a pack from the newer sets, or to update your deck for competitive play, then...damn. You might want to make a loud stink about it, in the hope that something will get done. Update: 01/15/2024, 9:55 a.m. ET: We’ve received a detailed reply from TPCi about this situation and the company’s attempts to address the issues with new reprints and restocks of its online stores. There is, however, no information regarding how it might attempt to prevent a repeat of the current situation, with bots and scalpers scooping everything first, nor indeed any mention of the other affected set, March’s Journey Together. Here’s the statement in full: We’re aware that some fans may experience difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon Trading Card Game: Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products at launch due to high demand impacting availability. We understand this inconvenience can be disappointing for fans, and we are actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity to acknowledge this. Reprinted products are expected to be available at participating retailers as soon as possible to help ensure more fans receive opportunities to access Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions. In addition, more new products from the Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions lineup will be launching in the coming months. Pokémon Center preorders for Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products that were placed during the preorder timeframe will begin shipping in mid-January. Scarlet & Violet—Prismatic Evolutions products will be restocked at Pokémon Center in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand later this year. Fans can subscribe to the Pokémon Center newsletter to receive updates. We’d like to thank the community for their continued support and patience as we work to deliver this highly anticipated expansion to fans. .

Welcome back to the newsletter. We are changing things up, so expect to see at least two editions each week, with the occasional special edition. The newsletter will continue to live on Engadget.com too, but if you haven’t subscribed, you should do that. Next week, Samsung will reveal its next family of Galaxy phones. Not the foldables, no, but the traditional S series devices. Going on track record, we can expect to see three S25 devices: standard, Plus and Ultra. There’s unlikely to be a huge change to aesthetics, but we expect some subtle differences — rounded corners, flatter edges and (of course) thinner bezels. Inside, at least in the US, the S25 series will probably be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite, designed for on-device generative AI. The chip promises 45 percent faster single- and multi-core performance while using 27 percent less power than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, so it could improve battery life too. Some rumors suggest a Galaxy S25 Slim with a — you guessed it — slimmer design. It’s all very on trend. However, given the FCC certifications only appear to cover the usual trio of flagships, that device may not arrive until later in the year. (If at all.) Expect an awful lot of AI razzle-dazzle too. One rumor suggests the Galaxy S25 series will include “an AI Agent that provides personalized clothing suggestions and transport information,” even though Google and myriad third-party apps already fully service the latter. I’d put money on a laborious bragging segment from Samsung and its AI tricks — many of which will fall by the wayside. A request: Please steal the Pixel’s Add Me photo feature. We’ll be reporting live from Samsung’s first Unpacked event of 2025. Mark your calendar for January 22! — Mat Smith Get this delivered daily direct to your inbox. Subscribe right here!

In his Power On newsletter, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said the iPhone 17 Air will be roughly 2 millimeters thinner than any other phone model. “It will have a base-level A19 chip and a single-lens camera system,” Gurman notes, and will serve “as a testing ground for future technologies.” A single-lens camera could be an intriguing decision now three sensors is the standard for Apple’s most premium phones.

Back in May 2024, the company rolled out a mobile app rife with bugs and missing features like alarms and sleep timers. Some customers even complained that entire speaker systems would no longer work after updating to the new app. Sonos’ stock price has fallen by around 13 percent since the app launched. Sonos laid off over 100 people in August as it tried to fix the software and revenue fell 16 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended on September 28. Spence’s payout package includes $7,500 per month until June, a cash severance of $1.9 million and shares in Sonos. I aspire to screw up an app update. Continue reading. Meta appeared to block links to Pixelfed, a decentralized photo-sharing platform, on Facebook, according to users on both Bluesky and 404 Media. A small group of posts that linked to pixelfed.social was deleted, with Facebook’s Community Standards on spam used as a justification. There’s a bigger impetus for users to jettison Instagram: Meta just announced dramatic changes to how it plans to moderate speech on its platforms. The company is ending both its third-party fact-checking program and made changes to its Hateful Conduct policy last week. A Meta spokesperson said removing the posts to Pixelfed was a mistake, and they’d be reinstated. Continue reading.

Title: YieldMax™ Launches Its First Portfolio ETF The Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (LFGY)

January 14, 2025 06:55 ET | Source: YieldMax YieldMax CHICAGO, MILWAUKEE and NEW YORK, Jan. 14, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- YieldMax™ announced the launch today of its first YieldMax™ Portfolio Option Income ETF: YieldMax™ Crypto Industry & Tech Portfolio Option Income ETF (NYSE Arca: LFGY) LFGY Overview LFGY is an actively managed ETF that seeks current income and capital appreciation via direct investments in a select portfolio of 15-30 crypto industry and technology (“Crypto”) companies. LFGY aims to generate current income through an options portfolio on Crypto companies and/or Crypto ETFs. LFGY Equity Portfolio LFGY seeks capital appreciation via direct investments in its portfolio of 15-30 Crypto companies. To enable LFGY to effectively implement its options strategies (see below), LFGY’s Adviser evaluates the liquidity of a potential company’s common stock and the liquidity of its options contracts. Any dividend paid by its Crypto companies will contribute to LFGY’s income generation. LFGY Options Portfolio LFGY seeks to generate current income primarily by writing (selling) options contracts on some or all of its Crypto companies. Depending on the Adviser’s outlook, it will select one or more options strategies that it believes will best provide LFGY with current income while generally also attempting to participate in a portion of the share price increases experienced by its Crypto companies. Further, depending on the Adviser’s assessment of one or more of the Crypto companies’ options contracts (e.g., they are insufficiently liquid or too costly), LFGY may employ options strategies on a Crypto ETF. By strategically entering and exiting options positions, the Adviser seeks to enhance LFGY's income potential. LFGY Distribution Schedule LFGY is the newest member of the YieldMax™ ETF family and like all YieldMax™ ETFs, LFGY aims to deliver current income to investors. With respect to distributions, LFGY aims to make distributions on a weekly basis and its first weekly distribution is expected to be announced on January 22, 2025. Why Invest in LFGY? Please see table below for distribution information for all outstanding YieldMax™ ETFs. Note: DIPS, FIAT, CRSH and YQQQ are hereinafter referred to as the “Short ETFs” and “ADR” stands for American Depositary Receipt. You are not guaranteed a distribution under the ETFs. Distributions for the ETFs (if any) are variable and may vary significantly from period to period and may be zero. Investors in the Funds will not have rights to receive dividends or other distributions with respect to the underlying reference asset(s). * The inception date for FEAT and FIVY is December 16, 2024. 1 Each ETF’s strategy (except those of the Short ETFs) will cap potential gains if its reference asset’s shares increase in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset’s shares decrease in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. Each Short ETF’s strategy will cap potential gains if its reference asset decreases in value, yet subjects an investor to all potential losses if the reference asset increases in value. Such potential losses may not be offset by income received by the ETF. 2 The Distribution per Share is the most recent such amount as of close on January 13, 2025. Each Fund has a limited operating history and while each Fund’s objective is to provide current income, there is no guarantee the Fund will make a distribution. Distributions are likely to vary greatly in amount. Important Information Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. For a prospectus or summary prospectus with this and other information about each Fund, visit our website at www.YieldMaxETFs.com. Read the prospectus or summary prospectus carefully before investing. There is no guarantee that any Fund’s investment strategy will be properly implemented, and an investor may lose some or all of its investment in any such Fund. Tidal Financial Group is the adviser for all YieldMax™ ETFs. THE FUND, TRUST AND ADVISER ARE NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNDERLYING REFERENCE ASSET. Risk Disclosures (applicable to all YieldMax ETFs referenced above, except the Short ETFs) YMAX, YMAG, FEAT and FIVY generally invest in other YieldMax™ ETFs. As such, these two Funds are subject to the risks listed in this section, which apply to all the YieldMax™ ETFs they may hold from time to time. Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Call Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s call writing strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in the positive price returns of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold call options and over longer periods. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared (“cleared derivatives”). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund’s counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house (“clearing members”) can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying instrument, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. A high portfolio turnover rate increases transaction costs, which may increase the Fund’s expenses. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of call option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in increases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Call Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, which focuses on an individual security (ARKK, TSLA, AAPL, NVDA, AMZN, META, GOOGL, NFLX, COIN, MSFT, DIS, XOM, JPM, AMD, PYPL, SQ, MRNA, AI, MSTR, Bitcoin ETP, GDX®, SNOW, ABNB, BABA, TSM, SMCI, PLTR, MARA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to MARO) Digital Assets Risk: The Fund does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. The Fund does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than the Fund. Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to BABO and TSMY) Currency Risk: Indirect exposure to foreign currencies subjects the Fund to the risk that currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar. Currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons, including changes in interest rates and the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the U.S. or abroad. Depositary Receipts Risk: The securities underlying BABO and TSMY are American Depositary Receipts (“ADRs”). Investment in ADRs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market. Foreign Market and Trading Risk: The trading markets for many foreign securities are not as active as U.S. markets and may have less governmental regulation and oversight. Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers involve certain risks that may not be present with investments in securities of U.S. issuers, such as risk of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations or to political or economic instability, as well as varying regulatory requirements applicable to investments in non-U.S. issuers. There may be less information publicly available about a non-U.S. issuer than a U.S. issuer. Non-U.S. issuers may also be subject to different regulatory, accounting, auditing, financial reporting and investor protection standards than U.S. issuers. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to GDXY) Risk of Investing in Foreign Securities. The Fund is exposed indirectly to the securities of foreign issuers selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. Investments in the securities of foreign issuers involve risks beyond those associated with investments in U.S. securities. Risk of Investing in Gold and Silver Mining Companies. The Fund is exposed indirectly to gold and silver mining companies selected by GDX®’s investment adviser, which subjects the Fund to the risks associated with such companies. The Fund invests in options contracts based on the value of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX®), which subjects the Fund to some of the same risks as if it owned GDX®, as well as the risks associated with Canadian, Australian and Emerging Market Issuers, and Small-and Medium-Capitalization companies. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YBIT) YBIT does not invest directly in Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest directly in derivatives that track the performance of Bitcoin or any other digital assets. YBIT does not invest in or seek direct exposure to the current “spot” or cash price of Bitcoin. Investors seeking direct exposure to the price of Bitcoin should consider an investment other than YBIT. Bitcoin Investment Risk: The Fund’s indirect investment in Bitcoin, through holdings in one or more Underlying ETPs, exposes it to the unique risks of this emerging innovation. Bitcoin’s price is highly volatile, and its market is influenced by the changing Bitcoin network, fluctuating acceptance levels, and unpredictable usage trends. Digital Assets Risk: Digital assets like Bitcoin, designed as mediums of exchange, are still an emerging asset class. They operate independently of any central authority or government backing and are subject to regulatory changes and extreme price volatility. Potentially No 1940 Act Protections. As of the date of this Prospectus, there is only a single eligible Underlying ETP, and it is an investment company subject to the 1940 Act. Bitcoin ETP Risk: The Fund invests in options contracts that are based on the value of the Bitcoin ETP. This subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it owned shares of the Bitcoin ETP, even though it does not. Bitcoin ETPs are subject, but not limited, to significant risk and heightened volatility. An investor in a Bitcoin ETP may lose their entire investment. Bitcoin ETPs are not suitable for all investors. In addition, not all Bitcoin ETPs are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Those Bitcoin ETPs that are not registered under such statute are therefore not subject to the same regulations as exchange traded products that are so registered. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to the Short ETFs) Investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Price Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the value of the underlying reference asset. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the underlying reference asset, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, the Fund is subject to the risk that the value of the underlying reference asset increases. If the value of the underlying reference asset increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. Put Writing Strategy Risk. The path dependency (i.e., the continued use) of the Fund’s put writing (selling) strategy will impact the extent that the Fund participates in decreases in the value of the underlying reference asset and, in turn, the Fund’s returns, both during the term of the sold put options and over longer periods. Purchased OTM Call Options Risk. The Fund’s strategy is subject to potential losses if the underlying reference asset increases in value, which may not be offset by the purchase of out-of-the-money (OTM) call options. The Fund purchases OTM calls to seek to manage (cap) the Fund’s potential losses from the Fund’s short exposure to the underlying reference asset if it appreciates significantly in value. However, the OTM call options will cap the Fund’s losses only to the extent that the value of the underlying reference asset increases to a level that is at or above the strike level of the purchased OTM call options. Any increase in the value of the underlying reference asset to a level that is below the strike level of the purchased OTM call options will result in a corresponding loss for the Fund. For example, if the OTM call options have a strike level that is approximately 100% above the then-current value of the underlying reference asset at the time of the call option purchase, and the value of the underlying reference asset increases by at least 100% during the term of the purchased OTM call options, the Fund will lose all its value. Since the Fund bears the costs of purchasing the OTM calls, such costs will decrease the Fund’s value and/or any income otherwise generated by the Fund’s investment strategy. Counterparty Risk. The Fund is subject to counterparty risk by virtue of its investments in options contracts. Transactions in some types of derivatives, including options, are required to be centrally cleared ("cleared derivatives"). In a transaction involving cleared derivatives, the Fund's counterparty is a clearing house rather than a bank or broker. Since the Fund is not a member of clearing houses and only members of a clearing house ("clearing members") can participate directly in the clearing house, the Fund will hold cleared derivatives through accounts at clearing members. Derivatives Risk. Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from the underlying reference asset or assets, such as stocks, bonds, or funds (including ETFs), interest rates or indexes. The Fund’s investments in derivatives may pose risks in addition to, and greater than, those associated with directly investing in securities or other ordinary investments, including risk related to the market, imperfect correlation with underlying investments or the Fund’s other portfolio holdings, higher price volatility, lack of availability, counterparty risk, liquidity, valuation and legal restrictions. Options Contracts. The use of options contracts involves investment strategies and risks different from those associated with ordinary portfolio securities transactions. The prices of options are volatile and are influenced by, among other things, actual and anticipated changes in the value of the underlying reference asset, including the anticipated volatility, which are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and by national and international political, changes in the actual or implied volatility or the reference asset, the time remaining until the expiration of the option contract and economic events. Distribution Risk. As part of the Fund’s investment objective, the Fund seeks to provide current income. There is no assurance that the Fund will make a distribution in any given period. If the Fund does make distributions, the amounts of such distributions will likely vary greatly from one distribution to the next. High Portfolio Turnover Risk. The Fund may actively and frequently trade all or a significant portion of the Fund’s holdings. Liquidity Risk. Some securities held by the Fund, including options contracts, may be difficult to sell or be illiquid, particularly during times of market turmoil. Non-Diversification Risk. Because the Fund is “non-diversified,” it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a single issuer or a smaller number of issuers than if it was a diversified fund. New Fund Risk. The Fund is a recently organized management investment company with no operating history. As a result, prospective investors do not have a track record or history on which to base their investment decisions. Price Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will participate in decreases in value experienced by the underlying reference asset over the Put Period. Single Issuer Risk. Issuer-specific attributes may cause an investment in the Fund to be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment which diversifies risk or the market generally. The value of the Fund, for any Fund that focuses on an individual security (e.g., TSLA, COIN, NVDA), may be more volatile than a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole and may perform differently from the value of a traditional pooled investment or the market as a whole. Inflation Risk. Inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money. As inflation increases, the present value of the Fund’s assets and distributions, if any, may decline. Risk Disclosures (applicable only to YQQQ) Index Overview. The Nasdaq 100 Index is a benchmark index that includes 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, based on market capitalization. Index Level Appreciation Risk. As part of the Fund’s synthetic covered put strategy, the Fund purchases and sells call and put option contracts that are based on the Index level. This strategy subjects the Fund to certain of the same risks as if it shorted the Index, even though it does not. By virtue of the Fund’s indirect inverse exposure to changes in the Index level, the Fund is subject to the risk that the Index level increases. If the Index level increases, the Fund will likely lose value and, as a result, the Fund may suffer significant losses. The Fund may also be subject to the following risks: innovation and technological advancement; strong market presence of Index constituent companies; adaptability to global market trends; and resilience and recovery potential. Index Level Participation Risk. The Fund employs an investment strategy that includes the sale of put option contracts, which limits the degree to which the Fund will benefit from decreases in the Index level experienced over the Put Period. This means that if the Index level experiences a decrease in value below the strike level of the sold put options during a Put Period, the Fund will likely not experience that increase to the same extent and any Fund gains may significantly differ from the level of the Index losses over the Put Period. Additionally, because the Fund is limited in the degree to which it will participate in decreases in value experienced by the Index level over each Put Period, but has significant negative exposure to any increases in value experienced by the Index level over the Put Period, the NAV of the Fund may decrease over any given period. The Fund’s NAV is dependent on the value of each options portfolio, which is based principally upon the inverse of the performance of the Index level. The Fund’s ability to benefit from the Index level decreases will depend on prevailing market conditions, especially market volatility, at the time the Fund enters into the sold put option contracts and will vary from Put Period to Put Period. The value of the options contracts is affected by changes in the value and dividend rates of component companies that comprise the Index, changes in interest rates, changes in the actual or perceived volatility of the Index and the remaining time to the options’ expiration, as well as trading conditions in the options market. As the Index level changes and time moves towards the expiration of each Put Period, the value of the options contracts, and therefore the Fund’s NAV, will change. However, it is not expected for the Fund’s NAV to directly inversely correlate on a day-to-day basis with the returns of the Index level. The amount of time remaining until the options contract’s expiration date affects the impact that the value of the options contracts has on the Fund’s NAV, which may not be in full effect until the expiration date of the Fund’s options contracts. Therefore, while changes in the Index level will result in changes to the Fund’s NAV, the Fund generally anticipates that the rate of change in the Fund’s NAV will be different than the inverse of the changes experienced by the Index level.

Yuri Kageyama Associated Press Published: January 13, 2025 at 10:45 PM Updated: January 14, 2025 at 5:43 PM Yuri Kageyama Associated Press TOKYO – Most U.S. stocks rose Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation, though drops for Eli Lilly and other influential stocks kept indexes in check. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% as three out of every four stocks in the index climbed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 221 points, or 0.5%, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 0.2%. Recommended Videos Stocks got a boost from a report showing inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. Speculation is growing about whether the Fed may cut rates zero times this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market. Yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury held at 4.78%, where it was late Monday. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, eased to 4.36% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4.8% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.9%. Indexes drifted between gains and losses through the day in large part due to drops for several Big Tech stocks. Nvidia fell 1.1% and was the second-heaviest weight on the S&P 500. The only stock to drag more on the market was Eli Lilly, which fell 6.6% after saying it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter’s 45% growth in Lilly’s revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 21.7%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. All told Tuesday, the S&P 500 rose 6.69 points to 5,842.91. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 221.16 to 42,518.28, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 43.71 to 19,044.39. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.7% to $77.50 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.3% to $79.92 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Asian shares were mixed Tuesday, echoing trading on Wall Street, where gains for oil and gas producers helped offset drops for Nvidia and other Big Tech companies. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index slipped 2.0% in afternoon trading to 38,394.09 following a holiday on Monday. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 8,231.00. South Korea's Kospi edged up 0.3% to 2,497.95. Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 1.9% to 19,234.98, while the Shanghai Composite surged 2.1% to 3,227.11. “After a holiday break, Japan’s markets are playing catch-up following last week’s market selloff,” said Yeap Jun Rong, market strategist at IG. Japan’s Finance Ministry reported that the surplus in the current account, a measure of the country's foreign exchanges in goods, services and investments, rose to 3.4 trillion yen ($21 billion) in November, up 54.5% from the same month the previous year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose 0.2% after erasing an earlier fall of 0.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 358 points, or 0.9%, while the weakness for Big Tech stocks dragged the Nasdaq composite to a loss of 0.4%. Stocks have been under pressure the last month, and the S&P 500 is coming off its fourth losing week in the last five as traders reduce expectations for how much relief the Federal Reserve may deliver this year through lower interest rates. Such cuts would give the economy a boost, and the U.S. stock market ran to repeated records last year on the assumption that more are coming after the Fed began lowering rates in September. But inflation has remained above the Fed’s 2% target, and recent reports have suggested a still-solid U.S. economy doesn’t need much help. Questions are growing about whether the Fed will deliver even a single cut in 2025. High rates put downward pressure on prices for all kinds of investments, and those seen as expensive can feel the stiffest punches. Nvidia fell 2% and was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500, though that represents just a smidgen of the index's huge gains in recent years. The chip company’s stock had nearly quintupled over the last three years amid the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Apple’s 1% slip and Meta Platforms’ fall of 1.2% were also among the heaviest weights on the market. Because they’re two of the largest companies on Wall Street, their moves pack more punch on the S&P 500 than other stocks. Moderna tumbled 16.8% for the largest loss in the S&P 500 after giving a forecast for revenue this coming year that fell short of analysts’ expectations. The vaccine maker, which is seeing a slowdown in COVID-related sales, is accelerating a cost-cutting program. Macy’s fell 8.1% after saying it will likely report revenue for the last three months of 2024 that’s at or slightly below the low end of the forecast range it had earlier given. Edison International fell another 11.9% as wildfires continue to burn in the territory of its Southern California Edison utility. The utility has said fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment was involved in the ignition of the Hurst fire. On the winning side of Wall Street were oil-and-gas companies after the price of oil climbed. On Monday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose 2.9% to $78.82, while Brent crude climbed 1.6% to $81.01. The Biden administration said Friday it’s expanding sanctions against Russia’s energy industry. Exxon Mobil gained 2.6%, and Valero Energy jumped 4.9%. By Tuesday afternoon in Asia, benchmark U.S. crude lost 38 cents to $78.44 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 47 cents to $80.54 a barrel. Shares of U.S. Steel rallied 6.1% after the Biden administration pushed back to June the deadline it imposed for the Pittsburgh-based company to unwind its proposed acquisition by Japan’s Nippon Steel. Intra-Cellular Therapies soared 34.1% after Johnson & Johnson said it would buy the biopharmaceutical company and its treatment for bipolar I and II depression for $132 per share in cash. Johnson & Johnson rose 1.7%. All told, the S&P 500 added 9.18 points to 5,836.22. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 358.67 to 42,297.12, and the Nasdaq composite slipped 73.53 to 19,088.10. In the bond market, which has been dictating much of Wall Street’s action lately, Treasury yields ticked higher. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.78% from 4.76% late Friday. It’s been climbing relentlessly over the last month, and it was below 3.65% just in September. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged up to 157.58 Japanese yen from 157.26 yen. The euro cost $1.0252, down from $1.0274. Exciting activities, hidden gems, and local flavors await you in Akita!

Title: Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed after drops for Big Tech leave Wall Street mixed

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. NEW YORK (AP) — Stocks gained ground in afternoon trading on Wall Street Tuesday following an encouraging update on inflation. The S&P 500 was up 0.3% in afternoon trading, after wobbling between gains and losses earlier in the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 201 points, or 0.5%, as of 2:14 p.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 0.2% higher. A report showed inflation at the U.S. wholesale level wasn’t as high last month as economists expected. It’s an encouraging signal ahead of a report coming Wednesday, which will show how much inflation U.S. consumers faced at gasoline pumps, grocery price registers and auto lots in December. Stubbornly high readings on inflation and a run of better-than-expected updates on the U.S. economy have sent Wall Street into a weekslong rut, pulling it further from the dozens of all-time highs set last year. The fear is that all the strong data will convince the Federal Reserve to deliver less relief this year through lower interest rates. The Fed has already hinted it’s likely to cut rates just two times in 2025, down from an earlier projection of four. But speculation is growing about whether the Fed may not cut rates at all this year. Such questions have sent Treasury yields sharply higher in the bond market, which cranks up the pressure on the stock market, but yields slowed their ascent following the update on wholesale inflation. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 4.79% from 4.78% late Monday after a couple oscillations in the morning. It was below 3.65% in September. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, edged down to 4.37% from 4.39%. On Wall Street, KB Home rose 4% after delivering a better profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. The rise in Treasury yields has made mortgages more expensive, but CEO Jeffrey Mezger said buyers nevertheless “continued to demonstrate a desire for homeownership and housing market conditions improved relative to last year.” Mezger said faster build times helped the company deliver more homes in the three months through November. H&E Equipment Services more than doubled to top $90 after United Rentals said it will buy its smaller rival for $92 per share in cash. The deal values H&E, which rents aerial work platforms, earthmoving equipment and other products, at $4.8 billion, including roughly $1.4 billion of net debt. United Rentals rose 5.2%. Drops in several Big Tech stocks had weighed down the market through much of the day, before several of them reversed course. Apple and Microsoft both erased earlier losses and were both up 0.1% in afternoon trading. Eli Lilly fell 7.4% after it said it expects to report weaker revenue for the last three months of 2024 than previously forecast. CEO David Ricks said last quarter's 45% growth in Lilly's revenue for its Mounjaro diabetes treatment, Zepbound obesity injections and other products in the incretin market wasn’t as big as expected. Also on the losing end of the market was Signet Jewelers, which tumbled 22.1%. The diamond seller said its sales in the peak shopping days leading up to Christmas this past holiday season were below its forecasts. Shoppers were focusing on lower-priced fashion gifts “even more than anticipated in a continued competitive environment,” said Joan Hilson, chief financial and operating officer. Several of the nation’s biggest financial companies will report their latest results on Wednesday, including JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, as earnings reporting season gears up. Such reports are always under the spotlight, but companies may be under even more pressure to impress this time around. If Treasury yields continue to rise, either stock prices need to fall or companies need to produce bigger profit growth to make up for it. In stock markets abroad, indexes were higher across much of Europe and Asia with a few exceptions. Japan’s Nikkei 225 index fell 1.8% following a holiday on Monday, but indexes were much stronger in China where stocks rose 1.8% in Hong Kong and 2.5% in Shanghai. Crude oil prices fell to give back some of their strong gains in recent weeks, which had also been cranking up the pressure on inflation. Benchmark U.S. crude eased 1.1% to $76.49 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, fell 1.2% to $80.07 per barrel. ___ AP Business Writers Yuri Kageyama and Matt Ott contributed. Sign in to access your portfolio
