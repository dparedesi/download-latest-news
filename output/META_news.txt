Michael Burry bet big on stocks in the second quarter, swapping out bearish put options for bullish call options and adding several fresh holdings to his portfolio. The investor of "The Big Short" fame revealed in a quarterly filing on Thursday that he purchased calls on Alibaba, ASML, JD.com, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Meta, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and VF last quarter. Burry's Scion Asset Management also built direct stakes in Bruker, Lululemon, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and MercadoLibre, while cutting his direct wager on Estee Lauder from 200,000 shares to 150,000. The UnitedHealth wager is notable as Warren Buffett, one of Burry's key influences, also invested in the health insurer last quarter via his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. Call options give investors the right to buy a certain number of a company's shares at a fixed price within a set period, allowing them to lock in a purchase price that may be lower than the market price. Similarly, investors can use put options to lock in a selling price, allowing them to profit from if the stock price declines. Scion is known for making big changes to its portfolio between quarters, but this was a particularly striking overhaul. At the end of March, it owned puts on Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, Nvidia, PDD, and Trip.com worth a notional $186 million, plus a roughly $13 million stake in Estee Lauder. Three months later, it held calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million, and a further six direct stakes valued at $56 million. It's worth underscoring that Burry may have rejigged his stock bets in recent weeks, and his disclosures may not paint a full picture of his investment strategy. Quarterly portfolio updates known as 13Fs only provide a snapshot of a firm's holdings with a six-week lag and exclude shares sold short as well as investments in private companies, foreign-listed assets, and non-stock assets such as bonds and real estate. Burry shot to fame after predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble — a wager that was immortalized in "The Big Short" book and movie adaptation. He's also known for making grave predictions of market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock, and betting against popular assets such as Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, and the entire S&P 500 index.

Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Ark Invest added 2,532,693 shares of BLSH in total across three of its actively managed ETF funds—ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF—as shares hit the market at the conclusion of the Bullish IPO. Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market today 8/13 pic.twitter.com/UStxQzSn36 — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) August 14, 2025 Bullish, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange and owns crypto media publication CoinDesk, offered shares in its firm for $37 as part of its IPO yesterday. But the stock quickly rose after trading began, reaching as high as $118 in the first afternoon of trading. The feat mirrors the explosive debut of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, which completed its IPO in June and quickly gained nearly 4x when it hit the market—outpacing IPOs from noted tech firms like Meta and Airbnb when they made their debuts. Ark Invest maintains exposure to Circle too, holding more than 4.2 million shares of CRCL across its ETFs, now valued at more than $626 million. It maintains exposure to crypto in other ways too, with combined holdings of more than $1.5 billion in shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD), both of which fall inside its top 10 holdings overall. It also holds around $17 million worth of shares in crypto exchange eToro (ETOR). Ark also has its own Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, which added $36.6 million in funds on Wednesday and holds more than $2 billion in assets according to data from Farside Investors. The success of Bullish’s IPO adds fuel to the accelerating trend of crypto firms seeking entwinement with public markets. Other exchanges like Gemini and OKX have signaled their interest in IPOs, with the former confidentially filing its intentions in June. Others, like FalconX and Kraken, are rumored to be in the mix as well. Shares of BLSH are up once more on Thursday, jumping nearly 10% to $74.60, bringing ARK’s holdings to nearly $189 million.

Title: Ethereum Could Surge To $15K As Institutions Pile In, Research Shows

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. According to Fundstrat research, Ether could climb much higher before the end of 2025, with price targets ranging from $10,000 to as high as $15,000. Reports show Ether jumped about 60% over the past 30 days and hit a four-year high near $4,770 in early trading, while other coverage put the token at $4,694 and noted a 78% surge over an eight-week stretch. Those moves have pushed Ether close to its all-time peak, and fund managers are taking notice. According to Fundstrat’s chief information officer Tom Lee and head of digital asset research Sean Farrell, institutional forces and new rules are key drivers. They point to stablecoin work and tokenized projects being built mostly on Ethereum, and they cite regulatory efforts such as the GENIUS Act and the SEC’s so-called Project Crypto as factors that could speed Wall Street’s move onto blockchain rails. Based on data, Ethereum holds a commanding 55% share of the $25 billion real-world asset tokenization sector, a stat that Fundstrat uses to argue for broader institutional adoption. Reports have disclosed large-scale corporate accumulation that several analysts say is taking supply off the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies has reportedly added about 1.2 million ETH since early July, leaving the company with roughly $5.5 billion worth of Ether on its books. Company stock (BMNR) has been volatile, with some coverage pointing to a 1,300% jump over a short period. Fundstrat and other observers say those kinds of corporate treasuries, combined with fresh ETF flows, could create a structural bid for ETH if the buying is sustained. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, described these positions as strategic and long-term, saying they remove “substantial liquidity” from trading pools. According to Fundstrat, Ether is outperforming Bitcoin this year. One set of figures put ETH’s year-to-date gain at 28% against Bitcoin’s 18%, while other reports more recently showed ETH up 41% YTD and Bitcoin up 30% YTD, with BTC trading near $121,000 in that snapshot. Based on reports, Fundstrat’s analysts view ETH as a major macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years if institutional and regulatory trends continue to push demand higher. Analysts caution that lofty targets will need sustained, large inflows to become reality. Watch for the pace and consistency of ETF flows, corporate treasury disclosures, and any regulatory moves around stablecoins and custody rules. There’s also a practical concern: big, concentrated buys can tighten markets quickly but may also reverse if sentiment shifts or liquidity needs change. According to analysis and public comments from Fundstrat, the bullish case for Ether is clear and backed by specific numbers: $10,000 to $15,000 targets, corporate treasuries holding millions of ETH, and rapid recent gains.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Adtech Stocks Tumble as AI, Increased Competition Weigh on Revenue

A turbulent Q2 earnings season has divided the adtech sector, as investors sell off shares of The Trade Desk, PubMatic, and Viant. Compared to the NASDAQ Composite, indicative of the broader market’s health, adtech stocks are trending down. Few firms, including AppLovin and Criteo, have been able to weather the selloff. Experts say the latest figures underscore the challenges facing adtech companies today; chief among them is competition with Big Tech titans who are increasingly entering their territory. The sector is now “operating in a market dominated by Google, Meta, and Amazon—three vertically integrated giants that collectively control the lion’s share of digital ad spend,” said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. “They not only run the largest ad networks but also own the platforms, data, and exchanges, allowing them to extract value from every part of the digital supply chain—often at the expense of publishers, advertisers and adtech companies.” Add in the complexities of navigating the AI boom—which is causing upheaval in how people search and stifling publisher traffic—and adtech companies are finding themselves in a new kind of pressure cooker. Demand-side platform The Trade Desk basked in Wall Street’s good graces throughout 2024 and into early 2025, as its share price soared and Q1 revenues achieved 26% year-over-year growth. But the tides have quickly turned: The stock plunged nearly 40% late last week on the back of the company’s Q2 earnings report, which showed slowing revenue growth and heightened competition from Big Tech firms like Amazon. CEO Jeff Green insisted on a call with investors that “Amazon is not a competitor.” Financial analysts expect a declining growth rate for The Trade Desk throughout the second half of the year. PubMatic, a leading sell-side platform, cited changes by a top demand-side partner in July for revenue hiccups. Its stock is down about 20% since earnings were reported Monday, and more than 30% over the last two weeks. The company’s CEO Rajeev Goel said on a call with investors that “a top DSP buyer shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently, impacting our revenue.” He added that PubMatic plans to “diversify ad spend away from legacy DSPs.” MNTN, the CTV darling that shot to prominence with the help of Ryan Reynolds and his creative agency Maximum Effort, saw shares tumble after reporting its first-ever earnings on the back of a May IPO. Only a few major firms have been able to weather the adtech selloff. Chief among them is AppLovin, which helps developers monetize mobile apps with ads. In June, AppLovin sold off its mobile apps business, which spurred increased investor confidence and netted it.$400 million in cash. The stock saw double-digit growth last week after it reported Q2 earnings that showed a 77% jump in revenue year-over-year, to $1.26 billion. AppLovin surpassed The Trade Desk last year to become the largest adtech company by market cap. Zeta Global, which positions itself as an AI-powered marketing cloud platform, has seen increased investor interest over the last two weeks. Criteo, a commerce-focused DSP, is also holding its own, even as rivals pose a growing threat. Meanwhile, the two leading ad verification vendors, Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify, were split. IAS’s stock spiked after an August 7 earnings report that included better-than-expected publisher performance, plus an adjusted EBITDA of $109.84 million. DoubleVerify, however, fared poorer. The firm beat revenue estimates, but missed on earnings per share. The adtech sector is entering the back half of 2025 with investor sentiment sharply divided, compounded by anxieties over AI and macroeconomic uncertainty in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs and steady inflation. Some analysts are confident about the industry as a whole, but see this selloff as a sign of splintering and increased competition. “Adtech companies are in a surprisingly solid place, by which I mean most businesses are running well enough with low double-digit growth on average, and mostly with growing profitability,” said Brian Wieser, principal and CEO of Madison and Wall. “If there’s a problem, it’s that there is no consolidator, and so the business seems likely to remain a fragmented, almost cottage industry, with a large number of mid-sized companies but few giants.” Kendra Barnett is Adweek's senior tech reporter.

Title: AI Is A Money Trap

Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!

The WooCommerce Blog The WooCommerce Blog August 13, 2025 Selling on an ecommerce platform like WooCommerce gives you the greatest amount of control over your own online store, marketing, and product positioning. But can you do more to increase your global reach and engage with new shoppers who wouldn’t have any other way to find your products? Yes, and selling products on multiple marketplaces, in addition to your ecommerce store, is the answer. These channels give you access to existing audiences so you can reach more customers in more places. The top multichannel marketplaces reach a wide range of people across the globe. Let’s go over some popular picks to understand how they can help you scale. You’re probably familiar with many of the best online marketplaces for multichannel selling — like Amazon and eBay. But there are several others with a comparable reach like Walmart, Etsy, and social media marketplaces such as TikTok Shop. There are also platforms that have a broad reach within a specific region, like OnBuy and Kogan. Here are some things to consider when choosing the right marketplaces for your business: Remember that you don’t have to commit to just one of these online sales channels. You can sell on multiple channels or give an online marketplace a trial run before migrating all of your products. Let’s take a closer look at the top multichannel marketplaces: Amazon has come a long way from its early days as an online bookseller. It’s now about as close as you can get to an everything-seller as it expands with brands like Whole Foods Market. Most of Amazon’s products come from other marketplace sellers, including ecommerce businesses that want to expand their reach to new audiences. Amazon’s long history gives it the advantage of time-tested features like Amazon Prime, its membership program for frequent customers. Some of the key advantages of selling on Amazon include: As an Amazon seller, you can also sign up for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to have Amazon handle the shipping process for you. With FBA, you can offer two-day Amazon Prime shipping, which adds legitimacy to your products through Amazon’s implied endorsement. Selling products on Amazon comes with a few selling fees, depending on how you use the marketplace. Every seller pays them: Additional fees may apply for refunds, high-volume product listings, and services like FBA. This marketplace has a wide appeal and reach due to its broad global availability. Amazon ships to numerous countries through its AmazonGlobal program. When you partner with Amazon through FBA, your products become eligible for AmazonGlobal, helping you reach customers all over the world. And if you choose to serve the United States as part of those countries, you’ll enjoy the benefits of selling products through a reputable brand. Clarify Capital’s study on consumer trust found that people across generations considered Amazon their most trusted retail brand in 2023. Once you set up your account with Amazon, your team can integrate it with your WooCommerce store to manage your Amazon listings alongside your WooCommerce listings. Install the Amazon for WooCommerce extension to get started. eBay began as a place to sell used items through bidding competitions. Now, merchants can also sell new items through fixed price product listings, making it a great option for large and medium-sized online businesses. However, eBay is still most likely the best match for you if you sell pre-owned or refurbished items. Since eBay has been around for such a long time, it benefits from a more loyal group of buyers than something like Amazon. eBay itself notes that it has a base of “enthusiast buyers” who spend thousands of dollars a year on the marketplace. eBay is a true marketplace. It sells no products of its own, so your only competition comes from other sellers, not the parent company. Key advantages of selling on eBay include: Sellers on eBay pay two types of selling fees: If you choose to buy an annual eBay Store subscription, the cost is: These plans progressively offer more free listings and lower selling fees, allowing you to scale your eBay store alongside your business. According to eBay, its most dedicated online shoppers fall into four categories: Since eBay emphasizes that the second and third types of buyers drive the most growth, you’re likely better off sticking to a niche or using eBay’s tools to offer great deals. Sync your eBay and WooCommerce stores with the eBay Integration for WooCommerce extension. Walmart began as a brick-and-mortar retailer, not an ecommerce marketplace. But once it started selling online, Walmart quickly ramped up to compete against the biggest names. Walmart integrates marketplace products into its regular listings, so when someone searches for something on Walmart, marketplace items appear alongside products from Walmart. This can add both credibility and visibility to your catalog. Walmart Marketplace offers standard features like customer reviews, alongside more unique options, like: WFS works very much like Fulfillment by Amazon. You send your products to Walmart’s multiple warehouses. Then, when orders are placed, they pack and ship your products for you. Joining WFS also gives you the option to offer two-day shipping. A stricter qualification process is a good reason to consider Walmart, too. It only accepts sellers with a record of previous ecommerce success. This policy ensures that all its sellers are reputable, with quality offerings. Unlike Amazon or eBay, Walmart charges no fees for setup, listings, or subscriptions. It instead charges a fee per sale, which varies by product category. The range goes from 5% to 20%, but the majority of product fees are either 8% or 15%. Additional selling fees apply for those using WFS. WFS charges for each unit shipped, based on weight. Walmart Marketplace sellers benefit from Walmart’s reach as a major retailer in North America. According to Walmart’s research on the Marketplace audience, more than half of Americans who shop on Walmart.com buy from the marketplace. These customers shop in the following product categories most frequently: Shoppers on Walmart Marketplace also value low prices. Walmart’s research shows that 82% of these customers consider price an important factor in their Marketplace purchases. You’ll have the best luck with this channel if you sell lower-priced goods over luxury items. As a WooCommerce user, you can manage your Walmart product listings in your dashboard with the right extension for your region. American businesses can use the Walmart Integration for WooCommerce extension, while Canadian stores can use the Walmart Canada Integration extension. Etsy began as a platform for people to sell unique, handcrafted items, rather than mass-produced products. And for the most part, it retains that mission. For online sellers, Etsy is the place to sell one-of-a-kind items. Regardless of Etsy’s start as a place for individual artisans, medium-sized businesses and enterprises can also use its services if they fit into the right product categories. If you primarily sell craft supplies or vintage items, Etsy will help you find your people. And if those products are a subset of your inventory, you can sell them on Etsy and mention your WooCommerce store in accordance with Etsy policies. Etsy has some features similar to other platforms, such as apps, seller support, and the ability to customize your Etsy shop. In addition, Etsy’s seller benefits include: Rather than a monthly subscription, Etsy charges the following listing and transaction fees: Some stores may also need to pay a $15 one-time setup fee. Etsy’s audience is very distinct from the other top marketplaces online because it focuses on three product categories: handmade goods, vintage items, and craft supplies. This niche focus means that Etsy shoppers are either looking for items they can’t find anywhere else or hoping to make their own unique creations. It’s a treasure hunt for the right find for a vintage collection or craft project. Unlike the last three marketplaces you learned about, Etsy serves a very specific audience, so some stores will find it to be an incredible opportunity to spur growth. WooCommerce also integrates with Etsy to make your life easier as an ecommerce seller. Add the Etsy for WooCommerce extension to get started. In recent years, social media giants like Meta and TikTok introduced in-platform stores like the Facebook Shop and TikTok Shop. These marketplaces work a little differently than the ones discussed so far. They connect directly to your social media profiles to create a seamless shopping experience for your followers. This makes them ideal if you have a particularly strong audience on social. Meta shops and TikTok Shop offer different experiences. While Facebook and Instagram focus mainly on your posts and profile, TikTok Shop also has a dedicated marketplace where users can search based on products and categories similar to other top marketplaces. Facebook and Instagram shops act like an extension of your current profiles. You can: Interactions with your store happen between followers and your profile rather than through a separate marketplace. In other words, Meta shops act like a proxy rather than an entirely different channel. Meanwhile, the TikTok Store offers similar features to Meta stores as well as a marketplace where customers can browse items independent of profiles. Sellers can also appear in TikTok’s Shop tab and join the Shop Mall program for extra visibility. TikTok users can search for the products they want in the Shop tab and see relevant listings regardless of the profiles they follow. Meta and TikTok also have different pricing models due to the nature of each platform. While you can use Facebook and Instagram shops for free, TikTok does charge seller fees. Currently, sellers who opt to direct customers to Instagram or Facebook’s checkout have to pay a payment processing fee of 2.9-3.49%. However, Meta plans on sunsetting in-platform checkout, so both shops will soon have no fees. Meanwhile, in exchange for its more robust features, TikTok charges the following fees for each sale: Just as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have different audiences, each store has a distinct audience as well. All three have a vast number of users, so it’s a matter of finding the right fit for your market. Here’s a general breakdown of each user base: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok all have WooCommerce extensions to help you handle multichannel selling. Check out the Facebook for WooCommerce, Instagram Sync for WooCommerce, and TikTok for WooCommerce extensions. Marketplaces tailored to certain regions, such as OnBuy and Kogan, are perfect for geographic-based targeting. Medium-sized businesses and enterprises alike can tap into the potential of regional marketplaces if they have a good grasp on where their shoppers live. Otherwise, you may be better off sticking with more global platforms. The top feature of a regional marketplace isn’t something you’d list on a spec sheet. Instead, it’s the ability to attract people from the regions you serve. While features can vary, the best marketplaces do tend to offer standard features, such as order management and inventory tracking. Just like global brands, regional platforms take a variety of approaches to pricing. For example, OnBuy uses a plan-based pricing model without listing fees. Read a marketplace’s selling fees page carefully before you sign up. The reach of each regional marketplace varies. For example, Alibaba targets the entire Chinese ecommerce market, as well as other countries across Asia, while Kogan is specific to Australia and New Zealand. Check your ecommerce platform’s analytics to see where your shoppers come from and how much they overlap with a marketplace’s audience. WooCommerce provides extensions for two regional marketplaces — OnBuy and Kogan. Other platforms may offer their own integrations, or you can hire a developer to create a connection using the REST API. Since selling on popular marketplaces involves multiple channels, it requires a slightly different approach than using your ecommerce platform alone. Follow these tips to maximize your success: Most top marketplaces have a search function that is similar to those of major search engines. In order to provide the most relevant results, it attempts to match a customer’s search terms with the information included in listings. That means that your listings should include the words and phrases shoppers might use to find your products. That said, make sure to check your platform’s seller guides for any marketplace-specific tips. You can also use the basics of search engine optimization as a starting point. Most top marketplaces also offer ads and boosted listings that you can use for more visibility. Before getting started, find out the following about your specific platform: Many of the top marketplaces integrate with WooCommerce, allowing for: WooCommerce has a variety of extensions you can use to link your marketplace channels with your main store. You can do this by following these steps: With WooCommerce, you can scale your store across multiple sales channels. So, whether you want to add one marketplace at a time or jump in with several, WooCommerce has the features to support you. Add extensions as you need them to keep everything up to date and provide the best customer experience possible.With all that potential at your fingertips, what are you waiting for?

Title: Why the latest inflation data gives investors a reason to smile

Good morning. Ever considered investing in real estate? You might already have a big piece of what you need. "House hacking" is a new strategy homeowners are using to kick-start their rental portfolios. In today's big story, the latest inflation data gave investors a reason to feel upbeat about what's coming next. What's on deck: Markets: Why day traders' summer dominance could be hit with a September chill. Tech: Microsoft is dangling multimillion-dollar offers to poach Meta's AI talent. Business: Taylor Swift used to separate business from her love life. Not anymore. But first, the rally continues. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Not too hot, not too cold — this was just right. The latest inflation report struck a good balance, delivering a best-case scenario for the stock market. The S&P 500 closed at a record high on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq rose over 1% and the Dow spiked nearly 500 points. US stock futures are continuing the climb this morning. The consumer price index rose 2.7% year-over-year in July, below economists' expectations of 2.8%. The figures may seem marginal, but for markets, this was the sweet spot. That's largely because it was likely low enough to allow the Federal Reserve to cut rates at its September meeting, BI's William Edwards writes. At the same time, the inflation reading was high enough to ease recession fears that had flared after the disappointing July jobs report, which included significant downward revisions to previous data. (The report rattled more than just economists — Trump promptly fired Bureau of Labor Statistics director Erika McEntarfer after the data was released.) Meanwhile, the latest inflation report opens up more positive possibilities. The CME FedWatch Tool now shows markets seeing 92% odds the Fed cuts rates by 25 basis points next month, up from about 80% on Monday. Higher odds are also now being priced in for cuts in October and December. For Trump, rate cuts can't come soon enough. "Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate. Steve 'Manouychin' really gave me a 'beauty' when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable." Writing in a Truth Social post early Tuesday, Trump said that he is also "considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed" over the "grossly incompetent" job he's done renovating the Federal Reserve. This is the latest twist in Trump's feud with the Fed Chair, which seems to remain in an uncomfortable phase. The markets, at least, may be entering a brighter one. 1. America's biggest bank is about to open its new headquarters. JPMorgan Chase's new 60-story skyscraper at 270 Park Avenue is full of high-end perks and amenities. The building includes a "state-of-the-art" gym — which the bank said employees will have to pay a membership fee to access — an Irish pub, AI tech systems, and more. Take a look. 2. A September showdown may be looming. Day traders outperformed professional money managers this summer, but their dominance might not last long. A historically seasonal pullback in retail trading and other headwinds threaten to upend the summer-long rally. 3. Trump's pick for Bureau of Labor Statistics chief suggested pausing US jobs reports. E.J. Antoni, Trump's nominee and chief economist at the Heritage Foundation, floated the idea on Fox News Digital earlier this month, citing accuracy concerns. Economists and market strategists told BI that such a move would be damaging for investors and economic planners. 1. Microsoft has Meta AI talent in its sights. The software giant has a list of its most-wanted researchers and engineers from Meta and has already begun offering multimillion-dollar pay packages, documents viewed by BI's Ashley Stewart reveal. It's a step to compete with the eye-popping comp Microsoft's rivals are offering in the AI talent wars. 2. AI coding startups have an inference whale problem. Anthropic and Cursor are facing surging costs from a handful of heavy users, which is eating into their business models. As a result, they're introducing tiers or rate limits to what was formerly a basic fixed-price monthly subscription plan. 3. Baconator with a side of AI? Michael Chorey, the executive responsible for building out the AI automation for Wendy's drive-thru, which he says can take orders faster than a human in a headset, is leaving after five years. Chorey exclusively told BI that he is joining Presto, a tech company developing AI-first drive-thrus, which he believes is the next era of fast-food hospitality. 1. To solve the housing crisis, think outside the bounds. Outside the city bounds, that is. Ned Resnikoff argues that connecting cities, towns, and suburbs into large regional governances would make it easier and cheaper to buy a home in the US. Taxes from exclusive enclaves, like Greenwich, Connecticut, or Sausalito, California, would help support nearby cities. 2. Taylor Swift is in her boyfriend era. The pop star hard-launched the title of her newest album, "The Life of a Showgirl," in a teaser clip of her boyfriend Travis Kelce's podcast. It signals a shift in her marketing strategy, where she's putting her S.O. and her relationship front and center. 3. You've heard of quiet quitting, now get ready for quiet cracking. The latest threat to worker engagement is quiet cracking, in which people show up to work and do their jobs but still feel dissatisfied. Some of the warning signs can look like less extreme symptoms of burnout, EY's chief well-being officer told BI.

Title: Trump's tariffs keep coming. Stock markets don't seem to care.
URL: https://www.nbcnews.com/business/markets/how-trump-tariffs-impact-stock-market-investors-rcna224521
Time Published: 2025-08-13T00:46:13Z

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At least for now, the U.S. stock market is on board with President Donald Trump’s increasingly aggressive use of executive power when it comes to tariffs. On Tuesday, major stock indexes hit fresh all-time highs as investors digested an inflation report that was mostly tamer than feared. While the details of the report suggest an overall mixed picture for the economy, it suggested fears of large immediate price increases from Trump’s tariffs may no longer be warranted. “Many prices will end up rising in time due to tariffs, but we don’t see inflation pressures persisting,” James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, said in a note to clients. “We are in a very different situation to 2021/22 when inflation soared to 9%.” While the rate of inflation for some goods exposed to tariffs picked up in July, it was weaker for others, like appliances and apparel. Last month’s heavier price increases were instead mainly found in service sectors like airfare and auto insurance rates. “The strength was concentrated to a few specific components and not broad based,” analysts with Citi said in a note. Tariffs are costs added to imports in the form of taxes. Goldman Sachs analysts have estimated that consumers have been responsible for as much as 22% of the cost increases, with the percentage set to climb as the tariffs work their way more fully into supply chains — though Trump attacked Goldman’s estimates Tuesday. Efforts by firms to stockpile goods ahead of the tariffs’ impacts, as well as summer discounts and ongoing tariff deadline extensions by Trump, have insulated consumers from further effects. Tariffs continue to get negative reaction in surveys, with a mid-July Fox News poll showing Americans disapproved of Trump on tariffs by a 26-point margin. That was virtually unchanged from April, when Trump revealed shock new tariff levels in his Rose Garden “Liberation Day” speech announcing soaring new import duty levels. Stocks, meanwhile, continue to shrug them off. After Tuesday’s inflation report, traders increased the odds of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its next meeting in September. When markets expect the Federal Reserve to loosen financial conditions and make it easier for businesses to borrow money, stocks tend to rise because firms will have to pay less money in interest. Stocks’ recent behavior is in stark contrast to their dramatic spring sell-off in the wake of April’s “Liberation Day” speech. Investor reaction was so intense that Trump instituted a 90-day pause to reconsider what was set to be a cornerstone of his second administration’s economic policy. Today, Trump’s focus on tariffs hasn’t abated — but he has dialed back the more maximalist tariff levels he initially outlined. Combined with signs of a shakier labor market, investors are more convinced that the Fed will err on the side of supporting the economy by lowering interest rates to support overall business activity. The performance of the stock market itself isn’t a full picture of the broader economy, however. Instead, the gains of the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increasingly reflect the outsized returns of a handful of tech companies that investors believe will reap massive gains from their investments in artificial intelligence technology. The so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks — Alphabet (Google’s parent), Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla — now account for one-third of the weighted average of the S&P 500, the broadest index of stocks Reuters reported last month, citing data from LSEG Datastream consultancy. According to analysis from Morgan Stanley, at the end of July, just 9% of companies that make up the S&P 500 were at 52-week highs. The index’s movements are thus now heavily correlated with changes to the outlook of a handful of companies. If just one of them underperforms, it can take the entire market down with it. “When a handful of stocks dominate the market ... if you do have a period of disappointment from those stocks, you could see disproportionate impacts on your portfolio from just a handful of company-specific issues,” Michael Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede financial group, told Reuters. Small businesses remain especially vulnerable to the impact of tariffs, since they have less pricing power than larger firms. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the country’s largest small-business trade group, reported Tuesday that a shrinking share of respondents say they are profitable. “Increased costs are affecting everyone. I believe things will improve, but it will take time — six to 12 months. I just hope small businesses can hold on that long,” the NFIB quoted an unnamed fabricated metal product manufacturing firm in Michigan as saying in a July report. The U.S. economy isn’t out of the woods yet, said Kevin Gordon, director and senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab financial group. Thursday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report a separate measure of inflation that tracks wholesale inflation, or what producers get for their products and which tends to be more closely watched by the Federal Reserve. If it shows more pronounced signs of inflation than what Tuesday’s report suggested, stocks could quickly come down from their new highs. Barring that, conditions remain more benign than feared, he said, potentially setting the stage for further stock gains. “Weaker growth is not a concern at the moment,” he said. “Yes, there’s been some pullback, but it doesn’t mean we’re in any kind of recessionary scenario.” Rob Wile is a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist covering breaking business stories for NBCNews.com. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Nuclear-powered AI could make Rolls Royce UK's most valuable firm, says boss
URL: https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8772d4jzgo
Time Published: 2025-08-12T23:01:03Z

Rolls-Royce's plan to power artificial intelligence (AI) with its nuclear reactors could make it the UK's most valuable company, its boss has said. The engineering firm has signed deals to provide small modular reactors (SMRs) to the UK and Czech governments. AI has boomed in popularity since 2022, but the technology uses lots of energy, something which has raised practical and environmental concerns. Rolls-Royce chief executive Tufan Erginbilgic told the BBC it has the "potential" to become the UK's highest-valued company by overtaking the largest firms on the London Stock Exchange thanks to its SMR deals. "There is no private company in the world with the nuclear capability we have. If we are not market leader globally, we did something wrong," he said. Mr Erginbilgic has overseen a ten-fold increase in Rolls-Royce's share price since taking over in January 2023. However, he has ruled out the idea of Rolls-Royce seeking to list its shares in New York as British chip designer Arm has done and the likes of Shell and AstraZeneca have considered in the search for higher valuations. This is despite the fact that 50% of its shareholders and customers are US-based. "It's not in our plan," said Mr Erginbilgic, a Turkish energy industry veteran. "I don't agree with the idea you can only perform in the US. That's not true and hopefully we have demonstrated that." Rolls-Royce already supplies the reactors that have powered dozens of nuclear submarines. Mr Erginbilgic said the company has a massive advantage in the future market of bringing that technology on land in the form of SMRs. SMRs are not only smaller but quicker to build than traditional nuclear plants, with costs likely to come down as units are rolled out. He estimates that the world will need 400 SMRs by 2050. At a cost of up to $3bn (£2.2bn) each, that's another trillion dollar-plus market he wants and expects Rolls-Royce to dominate. The company has signed a deal to develop six SMRs for the Czech Republic and is developing three for the UK. But it remains an unproven technology. Mr Erginbilgic conceded he could not currently point to a working SMR example but said he was confident in its future potential. There are also concerns about the demands on water supplies from the data centre and SMR cooling systems. In response, companies including Google, Microsoft and Meta have signed deals to take energy from SMRs in the US when they are available. Rolls-Royce sees SMRs as key to its future, but its biggest business is aircraft engines. Already dominant in supplying engines to wide-bodied aircraft like Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, it plans to break into the next generation of narrow-bodied aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320. This market is worth $1.6tn - nine times that of the wide-bodied . Rolls-Royce is a bit player in a market that has powerful and successful leaders, and that rival Pratt and Witney lost $8bn trying and failing to break into. The market is dominated by CFM International – a joint venture between US-based GE Aerospace and French company Safran Aerospace Engines. Industry veterans told the BBC that market leaders can and will drop prices to airline customers long enough to see off a new assault on their market dominance. But Mr Erginbilgic said this is not just the biggest business opportunity for Rolls-Royce. Rather, it is "for industrial strategy... the single biggest opportunity for the UK for economic growth". "No other UK opportunity, I challenge, will match that," he said. Although BMW has owned the Rolls Royce car brand for nearly 30 years, the name of the company is still synonymous with British engineering excellence. But in the early part of this decade that shine had worn off. The company was heavily indebted, its profit margins were non-existent, and thousands of staff were being laid off. When Mr Erginbilgic took over in January 2023, he likened the company to "a burning platform". "Our cost of capital was 12%, our return was 4% so every time we invested we destroyed value," he said. Two and a half years later, the company expects to make a profit of over £3bn, its debt levels have fallen and shares have risen over 1,000% - a ten-fold rise. So how did that happen? And is Mr Erginbilgic right to think that Rolls-Royce's roll is only just starting? The timing of his appointment was fortunate according to some industry veterans. Rolls-Royce's biggest business – supplying engines to commercial airlines – has rebounded strongly from the Covid pandemic. The company's most successful product – the Trent series of aircraft engines – are at the sweet spot of profitability as the returns on investment in their development over a decade ago begin to pour into company coffers. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 arguably made it almost inevitable that its defence business would see higher spending from European governments – which has been confirmed by recent announcements. Unions have not always been fans of Mr Erginbilgic's hard-charging approach. In October 2023, one of his first major move was cutting jobs, which drew criticism from Sharon Graham, the boss of the Unite union. "This announcement appears to be about appeasing the markets and its shareholders while ignoring its workers," she said at the time. However, overall global headcount has grown from 43,000 to 45,000 since 2023 and union sources say there is "grudging respect" for Mr Erginbilgic. Those sources give him one third of the credit for the turnaround around in the company's fortunes, with a third credited to market conditions and a third to his predecessor Warren East for "steadying the ship". So does Mr Erginbilgic really believe that Rolls-Royce can be the UK's most valuable company – overtaking the likes of AstraZeneca, HSBC, and Shell? "We are now number five in the FTSE. I believe the growth potential we created in the company right now, in our existing business and our new businesses, actually yes – we have that potential." Rolls-Royce is undoubtedly a company with the wind at its back – and Tufan Erginbilgic certainly believes he has set the sails just right.

August 12, 2025 08:42 ET | Source: Grabar Law Office Grabar Law Office PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV): Grabar Law Office is investigating whether certain officers and directors of DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: DV) breached their fiduciary duties owed to the company.

You can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to you whatsoever.Why? As alleged in an underlying securities fraud class action complaint, DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV), via certain of its officers, failed to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the above, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. What You Can Do Now: Current DoubleVerify (NYSE: DV) shareholders who have held DoubleVerify shares since prior to November 10, 2023, can seek corporate reforms, the return of funds back to the company, and a court approved incentive award at no cost to them whatsoever.

As alleged in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint, Flywire Corporation (NASDAQ: FLYW), through certain of its officers, consistently touted the sustainability of Flywire’s revenue growth and financial condition, while downplaying the anticipated negative impacts of permit- and visa-related headwinds on the Company’s business. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the strength and sustainability of Flywire’s revenue growth was overstated; (ii) the negative impact that permit and visa-related restrictions were having and were likely to have on Flywire’s business was understated; and (iii) as a result, Defendants’ public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

Kroger’s contract was at-will, and Ibotta failed to warn investors that a large client could cancel their contract with Ibotta without warning.

On Augst 5, 2025, allegations made in a federal securities fraud class action complaint against Genius Brands, now known as Kartoon Studious Inc. (NYSE: TOON) partially survived a motion to dismiss. The underlying Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Kartoon Studious Inc. (AMEX: TOON) f/k/a Genius Brands International, Inc. (NASDAQ: GNUS) made false and/or misleading statements regarding: (i) Nickelodeon’s purported broadcast expansion of Genius’s Rainbow Rangers cartoon; (ii) subscription fees for the Kartoon Channel!; and (iii) the Company’s growth potential and overall prospects as a company. The Complaint further alleges that while the share price of Genius stock was artificially inflated due to these misstatements.On appeal from the Court’s order granting Defendants’ motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ second amended complaint (SAC), the Ninth Circuit found that Plaintiffs plausibly alleged that “Genius’s representations regarding PennyStocks in its May 7 SPA were misleading, and Genius’s statements regarding Rainbow Rangers, Disney/Netflix, and Stan Lee caused [Plaintiffs’] losses.” In re Genius Brands Int’l, Inc. Sec. Litig. (Genius II), 97 F.4th 1171, 1190 (9th Cir. 2024). The district court then determined that “Plaintiffs’ claims under Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) and under § 20(a) of the Exchange Act are adequately alleged as to the Rainbow Rangers statements.” WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW: If you purchased Kartoon Studious Inc.

Title: Price And Promo; Reddit Ditches The Wayback Machine

Pricing Power If a marketer has a buck to spend, do they knock $1 off the price or spend $1 more on media? Sometimes, price can itself be promotional marketing. One famous example includes Costco hotdogs. The CEO notoriously (semi-jokingly, we hope) said he would be dead before raising the hot dog prices from $1.50 without sacrificing sales. Beverage brand AriZona Iced Tea requires essentially zero advertising. A can has cost 99 cents for 30 years. Price and promotions are intrinsically related. And one of Amazon’s innovations in ad tech is that its bidding logic and product rankings incorporate both price and promotion (two of the four Ps of marketing, for any marketing majors out there). Which brings us to Warby Parker. The glasses brand and data-driven digital-native bellwether has offered a baseline $95 pair of glasses for 17 years. And they’re fighting like heck to keep it that way, The Wall Street Journal reports. Relatedly, the company hasn’t had a CMO for more than a year. Investors are pushing for higher prices. Similar glasses have gone up everywhere else. But the company doesn’t want to touch its signature “P,” price. “We may have to increase that price at some point, but we’re going to do everything possible for as long as possible to not” raise prices, co-CEO Nate Blumenthal told investors last week. An Archive of Whose Own? Reddit is no longer playing nice with the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, The Verge reports. The Wayback Machine is a forensic library of online URLs. So users can see exactly how those pages looked on certain dates. It’s useful for accessing websites that have been edited, censored or shut down. But all that content makes the Wayback Machine a common target for AI scraper bots. As a result, the Wayback Machine will now only be granted access to Reddit’s homepage. More granular access would provide a backdoor for LLMs to scrape Reddit data without a licensing agreement. Reddit has taken a hard line against AI scrapers, but it said last year that its bot-blocking efforts would not affect “good faith actors” like the Internet Archive. Of course, that was before AI licensing deals became a double-digit part of Reddit’s revenue, according to an estimate COO Jen Wong shared with Adweek earlier this year. (Based on their latest earnings call, it sounds like ad sales make up the rest.) Anyway, if third-party archiving efforts keep getting caught up in the fight over AI scrapers, we might have to rely on publishers and platforms themselves to keep their own records. Which, as any journalist who’s seen all their clips disappear overnight can tell you, is not a great long-term solution. Read The Script AI scrapers are reshaping the web in another way: They skip over JavaScript. For one thing, all the LLM operators aside from Google (like Claude, ChatGPT and Perplexity) don’t index JavaScript, as confirmed and elaborated in a blog post by SEO consultant Glenn Gabe. That sounds innocuous, but it’s a major wrench in the online publishing machine – and a huge miss for the non-Google AI chatbots. JavaScript is how most visual or interactive elements are rendered online. This New York Times article on persuasive delusions based on ChatGPT convos, for instance, is heavy on JavaScript elements. Without JavaScript, key context goes missing. Google’s AI bot knows JavaScript because the Google Search crawler knows JavaScript. The net result is, in the new world of AI-based SEO, sites must package their site text, metadata and displays in basic ways that are most digestible to LLM bots. It’s sad that AI chatbots are missing so many of the fun videos that were hits on the early web. Also, notably, ads often render in JavaScript. Google’s AI bot might thus incorporate the ads that appear on a page into its model – ads appear in the Wayback Machine, too, for example – whereas other chatbots don’t see ads on pages, only empty white boxes. But Wait! There’s More! With hundreds of millions of hours of streaming content to sift through, Olyzon.tv uses AI to classify and target CTV inventory.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: Can The Trade Desk turn walled gardens’ retreat into open web gains?

Hear from execs at The New York Times, Thomson Reuters, Trusted Media Brands and many others This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → If you’re reading this, you’ll likely have seen at least some of the latest financial results posted by the ad tech sector’s coterie of publicly listed companies, with AppLovin and The Trade Desk leading the pack in earnings (see below). Both companies, talismans of independent ad tech, saw their stock prices dip in early hours after issuing Q2 earnings — despite reporting a 77% and 19% annual increase in revenues, respectively.In The Trade Desk’s case, this included an immediate 30% plunge. The declines were tied to “the narrative,” with analysts deeming guidance remarks underwhelming. AppLovin retained its lead as top earner, with The Trade Desk, now in the S&P 500, nearing $700 million in revenue for the period. Indies eye gains from Google’s troubles and walled garden retreat A common thread across several earnings was the potential to benefit from Google’s mounting legal troubles with the Justice Department. The week began with news that OpenX is seeking compensation for Google’s anticompetitive actions as part of an ongoing ad tech antitrust case. Meanwhile, Magnite leadership expressed similar concerns during their Q2 earnings call (see above). In a Q&A after The Trade Desk’s August 7 earnings call, CEO Jeff Green said these trials are creating opportunity for independent ad tech as marketers grow wary of Google and other Big Tech platforms. Green noted “the supply-side demand imbalance” favoring “the open internet” over walled gardens like Amazon, Google, and Meta. “Consumers spend more of their time in the premium open internet than they do inside of walled gardens,” he said, adding that walled gardens have an inherent conflict of interest. “I believe TTD and the open internet have a bigger TAM than Facebook has… Our goal is to buy the entire open Internet objectively for buyers.” He also claimed, “As Google and Facebook have largely abandoned the open internet, The Trade Desk is the largest source of third-party demand for many publishers around the world.” Profit trumps transparency in adland and finance While investors punished perceived weak growth forecasts, they appeared forgiving of structural flaws in the ecosystem. Several high-profile criticisms of the cohort barely registered in analyst questioning across calls. The last 12 months have been turbulent for the sector, with short-sellers targeting multiple companies, including AppLovin and Zeta Global, causing stock price volatility. Yet Q2 results suggest advertisers largely ignored these claims. In Q1, AppLovin’s stock fell 20% after Muddy Waters alleged unethical data use, prompting a rare off-calendar defense from leadership. In Q2 disclosures, executives emphasized plans to drive advertiser growth via AI and greater adoption of its self-serve platform, reducing reliance on sales or product teams. It also aims to expand internationally so its customer base is evenly split between the U.S. and global markets. With a Q4 rollout, AppLovin is targeting SMBs, expanding beyond in-app into broader web and e-commerce. CEO Adam Foroughi said testing has brought in hundreds of advertisers, “The new type of platform that comes to our platform is extremely incremental to our business… We expect that will increase the advertiser count quite quickly, and also allow us to go through live examples of advertisers coming in self-service [and then] all the way to scale on our product.” Despite revenues of $1.2 billion, up 77% year-over-year and beating expectations, AppLovin’s stock still fell 7% after the announcement — a sign of investors’ counterintuitive moves. Earlier in the week, Zeta Global, which faced short-seller reports late last year, posted similarly strong results. Earnings rose 35% year-over-year to exceed $300 million, signaling client confidence despite prior allegations. Analysts focused more on Zeta’s competitive positioning, particularly with agencies under pressure to develop high-margin software tools. Also under scrutiny in 2025 have been ad measurement and brand safety giants DoubleVerify and Integral Ad Science. Both reported Q2 growth: DoubleVerify at $198 million, up 21% year-over-year, and IAS at $149.2 million, up 16%. These gains came despite reports highlighting brand safety shortcomings. In March, Adalytics alleged DoubleVerify and IAS failed to block ads to declared bots despite advertisers paying for pre-bid bot filtration, and routinely allowed general invalid traffic, implying advertisers were misled about protection levels. This followed an earlier report claiming both allowed ads on sites with child abuse content, triggering a class-action suit against DoubleVerify. The company has responded with its own defamation case against Adalytics. Despite the controversy, revenue momentum and advertiser contracts appear to be sustaining both companies. On DoubleVerify’s August 5 call, leadership highlighted rising activity in social and CTV — up 14% and 45% annually, respectively — while fielding questions about relevance as the open web wanes. CEO Mark Zargorski, discussing AI’s rise, said, “So many of the AI solutions don’t include a lot of transparency on what’s going on… That’s part of our role, to drive transparency and open up that black box a bit.” He added that value remains strong among customers on Meta and other platforms using AI tools “without a lot of transparency or clarity on how we’re getting there.” LiveRamp also posted results for the quarter ending June 30 — “Q1 2026” in its reporting. Revenue rose 11% year-over-year to $195 million. Guidance for the next quarter was $197 million, with a full-year forecast of up to $818 million. “Google went from organizing the world’s information to stealing it, taking a sledgehammer to the implied contract the open web has relied on for so long.” –Odysseas Papadimitriou, WalletHub CEO, in a blog post explaining how his company has removed 40,000 pages of its financial content from the reach of Google and other AI search engines. Instead, this content will now be exclusively available to logged-in WalletHub users. Future of TV Briefing: 5 reasons CTV’s ROI comes up short for advertisers Despite the hype, CTV is still not the miracle media channel for advertisers. The reason? It’s still impossible to justify the costs, according to UM Worldwide chief investment officer Marcy Greenberger. ‘You can nullify the effects of what looks like change’: OpenX CEO John Gentry on its legal quarrel with Google After filing legal papers citing Google’s alleged misdeeds to subvert and dominate the online display ad ecosystem, notably in the Eastern District of Virginia, the same jurisdiction where the biggest company in advertising is doing battle with the Justice Department, seeking damages, and adding to calls for a structural remedy. Omnicom’s Samardzija To Join Stagwell In The Fall After Digiday first covered news of a pending leadership shakeup at Omnicom Media Group, with the pending exit of Annalect CEO Slavi Samardzija, it has subsequently been announced that he will join independent media agency Stagwell, with precise details of his role yet to be confirmed. The State of Digital, 2025, by LUMA Partners The macroeconomic environment improved throughout 2024, but uncertainty over the tariff policies to be enacted by the current U.S. administration caused market instability. Despite this, digital ad spend has rebounded, and AI is now considered a fundamental requirement for marketers, with the amount of mergers and acquisitions in the space experiencing a notable uptick in the opening quarter of 2025. More Like No Yield: A New Book Explores How Google Soaked Up The Web’s Ad Profits AdExchanger’s James Hercher sums up Ari Paparo’s book, “Yield: how Google bought, built and bullied its way to advertising dominance.” It features a host of familiar names such as Stephanie Layser, Jana Meron, Brian O’Kelley, Michael Barrett, Michael Rubenstein and many other industry leaders play prominent roles, all of whom help chronicle how Google ingested DoubleClick, and later went on to cross almost every tier of the market with a series of rollouts such as Project Poirot, Project Bell, Project Bernanke, Project Jedi Blue, Project Liberty, Project Wolf and Project Centillion. This Ad Tech OG’s AI-Powered Analytics Startup Just Raised $9M In Series A Funding Newton Research, a company led by ex-Data Plus Math exec John Hoctor has raised $9 million two years after it was founded, taking its total funding to $14 million. Contributors to the latest Series A round include Greycroft and Bessemer Partners, along with S4S Ventures, Aperiam Ventures, plus LiveRamp’s investment arm. Fortunes are fluctuating, despite earnings increases across the board… time for consolidation?

Title: Stripe Is Building A Blockchain: Can Openness Survive Branded Rails?

ByChristian Catalini ByChristian Catalini, Contributor. Fintech powerhouse Stripe is secretly building a high-performance blockchain called “Tempo,” per a now-removed job posting and Fortune’s reporting. This payments-optimized chain would fill a critical gap in Stripe’s crypto stack, complementing its recent acquisitions of stablecoin startup Bridge and wallet infrastructure provider Privy. Stablecoins promise to make crypto mainstream by delivering faster, cheaper, more interconnected global payments. The paradox: the same move could undercut what the technology set out to achieve. Add the rush to branded rails—Robinhood’s chain on Arbitrum, Coinbase’s Base on the OP Stack, and now Stripe’s Tempo—and we could end up close to where we started, just with block explorers. Worse, market concentration may rise if a few players use stablecoins to reach previously unimaginable scale. With the GENIUS Act now law, the next 12–18 months will likely determine the outcome. We’ve seen this tension before in the early internet’s open web versus walled gardens. In the history of technology, the pendulum regularly swings between centralization and decentralization. Even when a technology has a decentralizing effect, economies of scale in a new dimension—whether complementary resources, talent, brand, or distribution—inevitably become vectors of concentration. Once concentration becomes too high, the ingenuity of entrepreneurs and developers invents a new approach to reverse it. A prominent example is the early internet, which brought a wave of entry and competition to the heavily concentrated industries of telecommunications, retail, and media—only to create the perfect conditions for today’s tech giants to scale through network effects and capture a sizable share of value. Although the underlying internet protocols remained open and neutral, massive digital platforms at the application layer walled off participants from competing services by strategically breaking interoperability. From email to social media to payments, we spend most of our time and money within the confines of what the tech giants have designed for us. And while we are clearly better off—more choice, lower prices—it’s increasingly clear that some would prefer a world where platforms do not have as much power and influence over them. Crypto’s reason for existence was to break free from centralized intermediaries. After the 2008 financial crisis, Satoshi wanted to create a world where anyone could exchange value without having to trust a central bank or financial institution ever again. And while the original Bitcoin vision of a fully democratic network—“one‑CPU‑one‑vote”—didn’t pan out due to economies of scale in mining, Bitcoin did deliver what more and more financial institutions and some governments now recognize as a novel and neutral financial asset. Inspired by Bitcoin, entrepreneurs and developers have applied the same principles in an attempt to bring decentralization back to other digital platforms—starting with payments, but branching out into finance, marketplaces, messaging, and social media. Overall, progress toward decentralization is mixed: while it’s true that Bitcoin allows anyone around the world to be their own bank, the vast majority of consumers and institutions rely heavily on intermediaries for custody and use. Similarly, solutions that offer consumers greater control over their private data and the content they create have stayed niche—often because they lag in usability and convenience relative to the centralized counterparts they’re trying to replace. Convenience eats privacy for lunch any day—and it’s difficult to undo the entrenched network effects of the leading digital platforms. In payments, the most critical battle is unfolding now. Legacy infrastructure is siloed, and incumbents have tremendous power over what we can access—and on what terms. Because of winner‑take‑all dynamics, markets can become so concentrated that the public sector has to step in—the most salient example is China’s introduction of a central bank digital currency to unravel the payments oligopoly established by Ant Group and Tencent. Crypto is a natural, market‑driven solution to this. It provides neutral and decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, as well as truly open and interoperable financial rails via their base layers. But as the technology has matured, two core problems have emerged. The first problem is that cryptocurrencies are volatile and therefore expensive for payments and financial contracts. To address this, the market has focused on fiat‑backed stablecoins; this inevitably leads to centralization because issuance and sound management require a regulated financial entity to be in charge of—and accountable for—reserve operations. While distributed governance of a stablecoin network is technically possible, it is extremely difficult to get the design right. Libra is the most prominent example: despite backing from more than two dozen leading global companies and countless resources dedicated to establishing credible distributed governance, the project was always perceived as Meta’s initiative. Banks have tried for more than a decade to come together as consortia in response to crypto, and, to date, no joint project has delivered anything tangible. The reason is obvious: until the situation is truly dire, competitors are unlikely to commit to a joint solution—so, in the meantime, everyone hedges their bets across multiple tracks. Intuitively, distributed ownership of a stablecoin network makes sense and is not that different from what ultimately made Visa scale in the 1970s—when Bank of America relinquished control of the BankAmericard credit card program to respond to increasing competition from the consortium that would become Mastercard. Networks of crypto exchanges and fintechs, such as the Global Dollar Network, may be able to move faster, given the agility of the new entrants backing them, but they will still need to strike the right balance between economic incentives and governance to shift members from a wait‑and‑see mode—where everyone hopes to free‑ride on others’ efforts—into action. Even Circle’s Centre Consortium, which had only Circle and Coinbase as members, was dissolved and converted into a simple revenue‑sharing agreement. So, while there might be a solution to the decentralized governance of a stablecoin, what we know is that, to date, the only working model is one that places a single entity in charge of everything. This is, of course, problematic in the long term, and while issuers today control only the asset, they have already started expanding their offerings in ways that limit openness. For example, Circle announced its payment network (CPN), which places it at the center of how payments are executed—from defining rules and eligibility, to inserting itself into every API interaction and price and liquidity discovery, to, of course, collecting a fee. Put together, this setup is not that different from the model that has allowed Visa and Mastercard to dominate payments for decades. The second problem crypto has run into is one that is deeply tied to its roots: decentralization is expensive. The economic consequence is that you can only afford it where it truly matters. To date, among networks at scale, that’s been true only for the base layers of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana. At most, that yields a few thousand decentralized transactions per second globally across all of them combined—a far cry from what global payments would require, even before you layer financial services on top. As a result, most transactions no longer occur on the base layers (L1s) but on a sprawling ecosystem of high‑throughput scaling solutions (L2s). L2s offer near‑zero fees and instant settlement, and they’re profitable because they internalize Maximal Extractable Value (MEV)—the gains from reordering, inserting, or omitting transactions in a block. While crypto purists might decry this trend, it aligns precisely with economic theory: users are willing to pay a premium for decentralization and censorship resistance at the core settlement layer, yet they readily trade some of that for greater centralization in higher layers to gain lower costs and faster speeds. The base layers remain open and trustless, and depending on the application, participants may compromise further—even embracing fully trusted, centralized solutions. This trade‑off is broader than a user’s decision to be their own bank and self‑custody funds versus accepting some degree of trust in a third‑party wallet. When building products, Coinbase, Robinhood, and the like care deeply that the underlying network stays neutral and does not play favorites among applications, developers, or businesses—the way the tech giants do on their platforms. Essentially, they are willing to pay for decentralization and neutrality to reduce the risk of hold‑up and expropriation—something that has repeatedly played out on traditional digital platforms. To fully grasp what fast, low‑cost L2s will do to payments and competition in crypto, look no further than what the internet did to news and media: as the cost of distributing—and now, with AI, also generating—large swaths of content fell to zero, business models had to evolve drastically, and massive aggregators (Google, Facebook, Spotify, etc.) emerged to take advantage of the new economics at play. Because L2s remove friction, offer convenience, and allow builders to deliver experiences much closer to traditional fintech products, they are the obvious layer where most of the value will be created—and appropriated. Furthermore, as basic money becomes free and commoditized, competition shifts to the value‑added services and workflows associated with it. That’s exactly where fintechs, neobanks, crypto exchanges, and even traditional financial institutions have a significant advantage. Any one of these players, if it executes well over the next couple of years, can use the technology to establish the first truly massive and global financial network. Once it reaches scale, it could also progressively degrade interoperability, appropriating more of the value—much as today’s internet giants did. So what’s the most likely scenario? Based on how strong and persistent network effects have been in crypto over the last decade, it’s safe to assume that payments and financial services will disproportionately gravitate toward a couple of leading blockchains. The remaining chains will need to specialize within an industry vertical to stay relevant. Most activity will take place not on their decentralized base layers but on scaling layers branded and shaped by crypto and fintech players (e.g., Base, Robinhood Chain), applications (e.g., Unichain, World Chain), and financial institutions (e.g., Kinexys, Fnality, Partior). Players that control distribution—whether on the consumer, merchant, or institutional side—have a massive advantage, as they own the interface between the blockchain and the real world. Blockchains drastically lower the cost of verifying and coordinating onchain data, but their value is limited without a strong nexus with complementary offchain information—identity, compliance, credentials, creditworthiness, and more. That’s where friction persists—and where economies of scale will decide winners and losers. This is why stablecoin issuers have strong incentives either to commoditize the rails—by issuing on multiple networks and positioning themselves at the center of interoperability across them (e.g., Circle’s Cross‑Chain Transfer Protocol)—or to nudge most activity to a network they control, such as a new L2 or a higher‑level protocol like CPN. Either strategy gives them a shot at becoming massive global fintech leaders and capturing most of the value the technology creates. Meanwhile, crypto and fintech players will want to shift those same valuable transactions to a network over which they have more sway, such as a branded L2. In doing so, they’ll also want either to commoditize stablecoins and other tokenized assets, or to issue their own. In the latter scenario, stablecoins may well be used as a loss leader to expand the reach of a fintech’s offering, and domestic stablecoins will be issued to gain more control over the FX market and support local use cases. Real‑world assets (RWAs), memecoins, other tokens, and applications that are truly differentiated and exclusive to those networks may also help these branded chains retain volume within their borders. The same companies will be able to develop clever rewards and loyalty programs that increase consumer and business stickiness within their ecosystems. As convenience and economic reality win over dogmatism, crypto will look very different than it is today. The good news is that, as part of that transformation, it will be far more useful. And while that may come with more centralization, the fact that the underlying protocols are open source and forkable means that, no matter how large some players may become, they face more pressure to retain greater interoperability than under the status quo. It is also possible that because crypto protocols allow for new market design and incentives, the ultimate solution will be something that was not quite achievable for the internet protocols—which did not have built‑in monetization mechanisms. Regardless, once centralization materializes, some clever group of developers will work hard to undo it, and the cycle will repeat.

Advertisement August 11, 2025 | 7 min read Listen to article 4 min Barry Dudley of Green Square dissects the fledgling talks between S4 Capital and MSQ Partners, exploring strategic fit, the market forces driving the potential deal and what it could mean for Sir Martin Sorrell’s “new-age” marketing group after a turbulent few years. Sir Martin Sorrell founded S4 Capital in 2018 after leaving WPP S4 Capital, Sir Martin Sorrell’s ‘new-age’ digital marketing group, has confirmed that it is in very preliminary deal talks with MSQ Partners, the creative and technology agency network that is majority-owned by US private equity firm One Equity Partners (OEP). The potential deal – which S4 says would be structured as an acquisition of MSQ by S4 Capital rather than a takeover of S4 – comes after a bruising period for the group. S4’s share price has fallen more than 90% from its peak only a few years ago. The current market capitalization sits at around £140m, a fraction of the multibillion pound valuation it once enjoyed. I’ve heard rumors and seen reports of other interested parties in the past, including the likes of Stagwell, New Mountain Capital and Accenture. I suspect Sir Martin has had many conversations come at him, or indeed he has sought them. Probably even more are incoming right now. S4 Capital was founded in 2018 after Sorrell’s high-profile exit from WPP. Built on aggressive M&A, it focused on digital content production, programmatic advertising and data-driven marketing through acquisitions such as MediaMonks and MightyHive. Its client base reads like a tech-sector who’s-who: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta to name just a few. However, that narrow tech focus has been a double-edged sword. When the sector tightened budgets and many reallocated spend towards AI investments, S4’s revenues took a hit – compounded by accounting missteps, economic headwinds and rising interest rates. MSQ Partners, on the other hand, offers a broader spread of clients – more than 250, including Unilever, Haleon, Lego, P&G and Booking.com – across consumer goods, healthcare, financial services and B2B. It operates through a decentralized network of specialist agencies spanning advertising, PR, design, digital, and tech. Since being acquired by OEP in 2023, MSQ has invested in integrated, creative-plus-tech delivery models. We recently advised Precious Media, a connected commerce digital agency, on its sale to MSQ. So how could they fit: Complementary client bases – S4 is over-indexed to tech; MSQ brings balance through FMCG, healthcare, and finance. Capability cross-sell – MSQ’s creative brand-building could bolster S4’s digital execution; S4’s programmatic and data expertise could sharpen MSQ’s digital performance offering. Geographic scale – S4’s US and APAC strength could mesh with MSQ’s European roots, giving a broader footprint without heavy duplication. AI positioning – Both have leaned into AI narratives, but a combined group could pool their R&D resources. Advertisement The marketing services sector is undergoing its biggest structural shift since the holding-company era of the 80s and 90s. AI is reshaping creative workflows, media buying and data analytics. Clients are consolidating their agency rosters, looking for faster, integrated delivery. The network groups have been re-engineering their own businesses to face this new way of working, with WPP recently merging its media offer under one brand. All are focussed on, and investing in, AI to help them deliver across media, creative and processes. But these are big legacy firms… and big ships can find it notoriously difficult to change course quickly. This has created fertile ground for private equity–backed roll-ups and mergers of complementary mid-scale networks. We’ve seen a plethora of PE firms coming into the market and appetite isn’t abating. For OEP, combining MSQ with S4 could create another top-tier independent rival, not only to snap at the heels of the mega groups, but also some of the smaller challenger brands and the other PE-backed indies. It could also give MSQ more muscle in terms of its own future expansion, both geographically and in terms of capability infills it may need. Advertisement Will OEP take it off the stock market? I suspect it will, not least because it removes that historical peak – which was arguably a significant over-valuation – which will otherwise be a benchmark that continues to be referenced under the current listing. That said, maintaining the listing could open up other options in terms of financing future acquisitions. And where will Sir Martin end up if this goes through? His voting control and personal stake mean no deal happens without him seeing a clear path for himself. Wherever things go, he looks set for another defining chapter in his career.

Title: Is the A.I. Boom Turning Into an A.I. Bubble?

When Jensen Huang, the chief executive of the chipmaker Nvidia, met with Donald Trump in the White House last week, he had reason to be cheerful. Most of Nvidia’s chips, which are widely used to train generative artificial-intelligence models, are manufactured in Asia. Earlier this year, it pledged to increase production in the United States, and on Wednesday Trump announced that chip companies that promise to build products in the United States would be exempt from some hefty new tariffs on semiconductors that his Administration is preparing to impose. The next day, Nvidia’s stock hit a new all-time high, and its market capitalization reached $4.4 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, which is also heavily involved in A.I. Welcome to the A.I. boom, or should I say the A.I. bubble? It has been more than a quarter of a century since the bursting of the great dot-com bubble, during which hundreds of unprofitable internet startups issued stock on the Nasdaq, and the share prices of many tech companies rose into the stratosphere. In March and April of 2000, tech stocks plummeted; subsequently many, but by no means all, of the internet startups went out of business. There has been some discussion on Wall Street in the past few months about whether the current surge in tech is following a similar trajectory. In a research paper entitled “25 Years On; Lessons from the Bursting of the Technology Bubble,” which was published in March, a team of investment analysts from Goldman Sachs argued that it wasn’t: “While enthusiasm for technology stocks has risen sharply in recent years, this has not represented a bubble because the price appreciation has been justified by strong profit fundamentals.” The analysts pointed to the earnings power of the so-called Magnificent Seven companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla. Between the first quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of this year, Nvidia’s revenues quintupled, and its after-tax profits rose more than tenfold. The Goldman paper also provided a salutary history lesson. Between 1995 and 2000, it pointed out, the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose fivefold, and at the peak of the market a widely used valuation measure for the stocks that trade on it—the price-to-earnings ratio, or “P/E”—topped a hundred and fifty, a level not seen before or since then. By comparison, the five-year period from March, 2020, to March, 2025, had been relatively tame. It’s true, the Nasdaq had roughly doubled, and the P/E ratio had gone up considerably; but it hadn’t got anywhere near three figures. Having written extensively on the dot-com boom and bust, I found some of Goldman’s analysis persuasive. Many people have either forgotten, or are too young to remember, the extremes reached during the dot-com years. In the logic of speculative hysterias—from the seventeenth-century “tulipmania” in Holland to the rise of Pets.com—greed, FOMO, and the greater-fool theory of investing eventually combine to banish caution, common sense, and financial gravity. Back in March, there was plenty of FOMO and trend-following on Wall Street, but it hadn’t reached the levels of the late nineties. Five months on, however, echoes of the dot-com era are getting louder. Consider Palantir Technologies, whose A.I. software is used by the Pentagon, the C.I.A., and ICE, not to mention by many commercial companies. A couple of days before Huang visited the White House, Palantir released a positive earnings report. By the end of the week, according to the Yahoo Finance database, the market was valuing the company at more than six hundred times its earnings from the past twelve months, and at about a hundred and thirty times its sales in that same time span. Even during the late nineties, figures like these would have raised eyebrows. Eye-popping I.P.O.s, another feature of the dot-com era, are also making a comeback. At the end of July, Figma, a firm that makes software used by internet developers, and which has added A.I. features to its suite of products, issued stock on the New York Stock Exchange at thirty-three dollars a share. When trading started, the price jumped to eighty-five. It closed the day at $115.50—a two-hundred-and-fifty-per-cent gain on the offering price. Watching this market action, I was reminded of August 9, 1995, when Netscape, which made the Netscape Navigator web browser, went public. Its stock was priced at twenty-eight dollars, rose to seventy-five, and closed at $58.25. In percentage terms, this leap was smaller than the first-day rise in Figma’s stock, but it’s often described as the beginning of the dot-com bubble. It should be noted that, since Figma’s I.P.O., its stock has fallen back to below eighty dollars. This could be interpreted as a sign of sanity prevailing, but, given that the shares are still trading at more than double the offering price, other privately owned A.I. companies will be encouraged to enter the stock market. Renaissance Capital, a research firm that specializes in I.P.O.s, lists eight prominent candidates: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, Databricks, SymphonyAI, Waymo, Scale AI, and Perplexity. Almost all of these companies are unicorns: they have been valued at more than a billion dollars in fund-raising deals with venture capitalists and other early investors. But, across the country, according to the research firm Tracxn, there are about seven thousand smaller and lesser-known A.I. companies, more than a thousand of which have already received Series A funding from external backers to finance their operations. The ready availability of early-stage funding means that a necessary condition for a dot-com-style bubble is in place. So are three more: excitement among investors about a pathbreaking technology—generative A.I. clearly has the potential to impact great swaths of the economy; a Wall Street production line staffed by investment bankers eager to earn fees for organizing I.P.O.s; and accommodative policy. Last month, the Trump Administration announced an “AI Action Plan,” which aims to remove barriers to the deployment of the new technology and to deter individual states from introducing “burdensome” regulatory A.I. laws. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, appears to be preparing to cut interest rates next month, which could give another boost to the markets. There are, however, some important differences between now and the nineties, one of which is that the online economy is no longer a vast open plain on which enterprising individuals can propose to build castles to the sky. It is a redoubt of monopoly capitalism, in which Big Tech dominates the horizon. During the dot-com era, or its early stages, anyway, small startups could reasonably hope to exploit first-mover advantage, gain early traction, and create durable business franchises. In the A.I. economy, it seems possible that many of the rewards will go to top firms that can afford to build and maintain large A.I. models and can use their market power and financial might to ward off, or buy out, potential competitors. A vigorous antitrust policy could perhaps prevent this from happening, but, as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, the Administration’s pledge to pursue such a policy is now under threat from lobbyists and power brokers with close ties to the President. If investors decide that monopolies are the future of the A.I.-driven economy, the outcome in the stock market could well mean further gains for existing industry giants rather than a broad-based bubble. All of this is uncertain, of course. The A.I. boom is still in the stage of building out infrastructure—training large language models, building data centers, and so on. A.I. applications are just beginning to diffuse throughout the economy, and nobody knows for sure just how transformative, and profitable, the technology will be. In this environment, many investors are following the time-honored gold-rush strategy of buying the shovel-makers and big mine owners. But history teaches us that even this strategy is far from risk-free. In an interesting analysis that was posted on the financial-news platform Seeking Alpha, an analyst identified as KCI Research compared Nvidia to Cisco Systems, one of the firms whose stock went parabolic in 1998-99. Just as Nvidia’s G.P.U.s (graphics-processing units) are now widely regarded as must-have components of A.I. infrastructure, Cisco’s routers and other network equipment were viewed as essential components of the internet build-out; for a time, demand for them seemed virtually unlimited. Like Nvidia, Cisco was an innovative and highly profitable company. But, in April of 2000, its stock dropped by almost forty per cent, and a year later it had fallen by about eighty per cent. A quarter of a century on, it still hasn’t recovered the high it hit in early 2000, although, lately, it has come close. The Nvidia-Cisco comparison was a useful reminder of a dictum from the pioneering stock analyst Benjamin Graham, who was a mentor to Warren Buffett: in the short run, the stock market is a voting machine, but in the long run it is a weighing machine that weighs the cash flows that companies generate. Ironically, the Nvidia-Cisco analogy also inadvertently demonstrated how long the short run can last for, and how dangerous it can be to predict its end date. The analysis was posted in February of last year. Since then, Nvidia’s stock price has risen by another hundred and fifty per cent. ♦

Title: Artificial workforce: Microsoft’s layoffs are a canary in the coal mine for white-collar jobs

This is a Mint Premium article gifted to you. Subscribe to enjoy similar stories. In July, Microsoft announced it was laying off 9,000 employees, bringing the total job cuts this year to over 15,000. This isn’t a company in trouble. Quite the opposite: Microsoft just reported a quarterly net income of $27.2 billion, and its stock price has soared past $500 per share. So, why is it laying off thousands? The answer is chilling and profoundly important: Microsoft’s layoffs are not a sign of distress—they are a strategic reallocation of resources in response to a fundamental shift in how work gets done in the artificial intelligence (AI) era. These cuts are the canary in the coal mine—an early but unmistakable signal that the world of work, especially knowledge work, is about to be dramatically reshaped by AI. The implications are as important for tech leaders as they are for educators, entrepreneurs and policymakers. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella described the layoffs as a difficult but necessary part of aligning the company’s workforce with its strategic priorities. Those priorities are now unmistakably centred on AI. Also Read: Layoff riddle: Why are companies getting worse at letting employees go? So far, Microsoft has invested over $80 billion in building its AI infrastructure. Tools like GitHub Copilot are now writing as much as 30% of its code. In other words, AI is already replacing work previously done by humans—starting with highly-skilled engineers. The jobs cuts, however, swept through gaming studios, legal teams, sales departments and even marketing. Several promising creative projects, such as the long-anticipated reboot of Perfect Dark, were quietly cancelled. Some affected studios were unionized, a sign that even organized workforces are not immune. This is not a temporary cost-cutting exercise. It is a strategic reshaping of the workforce. The new mantra inside Microsoft—“Intensity, clarity, and bold execution"—isn’t just motivational. It reflects a shift toward a leaner, faster and increasingly automated workforce. Microsoft’s central position in enterprise software and cloud infrastructure gives it an unmatched view of business sentiment and technology trends. When Microsoft cuts jobs, it often foreshadows broader shifts in the economy. In this case, the warning is stark: AI is not just a tool to augment jobs—it is replacing them outright. Also Read: AI didn’t take the job. It changed what the job is. Amazon, Google, Meta, Salesforce and many others have also made deep cuts, some citing AI directly. Even traditionally ‘safe’ white-collar roles are increasingly vulnerable. A recent report from Microsoft Research listed programmers, mathematicians, customer service agents, translators, researchers, writers, legal assistants and salespeople among the first in line for disruption. This challenges a popular myth—that only routine or low-end jobs are at risk. AI excels at generating code, writing and summarizing documents, and analysing large data-sets. And it is improving rapidly. Many tech CEOs like to downplay the coming tsunami with soothing ideas such as “AI won’t replace you—a person using AI will" and “every technology destroys some jobs but creates many others and AI is no different." These are simplistic and self-serving. Be very clear: in the medium and short terms, which are what matter for most of us, AI will likely have a devastating impact on a lot of white-collar jobs and wages. For countries like India, this poses both risks and transformative opportunities. On one hand, millions of our white-collar jobs in information technology (IT) services, business process outsourcing (BPO) and content creation are at risk. These sectors have been engines of upward mobility and economic growth. If we are not proactive, AI could erode much of this progress. On the other hand, AI has the potential to unlock new solutions in education, healthcare, agriculture and public services. It can dramatically increase productivity, personalize services and bridge gaps in human capacity. But only if we invest in the right infrastructure, skills and safety nets. Also Read: Devina Mehra: Yes, AI is coming for our jobs; it’s the old story of new tech How the AI revolution plays out isn’t a given; it will be shaped by the choices that we make as CEOs , policymakers and leaders. As a tech and development leader, I believe we need a radically new playbook to navigate this transformation. Re-imagine education and skilling: We must move beyond traditional degree-based learning and embrace lifelong, flexible and tech-enabled skill development. Foundational digital literacy, data fluency and adaptability must be priorities. Support mass entrepreneurship: If formal employment is shrinking due to automation, we must create the conditions for millions to become self-employed or run micro-enterprises. In the 21st century, entrepreneurship is not a career choice—it is a life skill. Governments and the private sector should invest in promoting entrepreneurship, small businesses and strengthening local entrepreneurship ecosystems. Build an inclusive AI strategy: AI should not be designed only for the rich. India must lead the world in AI applications that serve small farmers, frontline health workers, teachers, small business owners and informal workers, ensuring that the revolution lifts the many, not just the few. Foster humane corporate cultures: The way layoffs are being handled—often without notice or severance—risks breaking trust in organizations. Companies must find a more responsible and compassionate approach to workforce transition. Culture, after all, is a competitive advantage. Create public policy for resilience: Governments must track labour market shifts in real time and build social safety nets that are fit for the AI era, whether that means unemployment insurance, portable benefits or incentives for reskilling.

It was to act quickly when signs appeared. Microsoft’s layoffs are that sign. They tell us that AI is not something for the distant future. It’s already here, and is changing how work takes place, who gets employed and what skills matter. We simply cannot afford to sleepwalk into this future. We must act now—with clarity, courage and care. This is not just a tech issue. It is a social, economic and moral challenge that will define our generation. Let’s not waste the warning. Let’s build a future where AI empowers and uplifts, rather than excludes and displaces.

Title: OpenAI to give employees ‘special’ million-dollar bonuses amid AI talent wars

OpenAI has announced a ‘special one-time award’ to its AI researchers and engineers across several departments, including applied engineering, scaling, and safety. The bonuses were announced a day before the Microsoft-backed AI startup unveiled GPT-5, its latest and most advanced large language model (LLM). More than 1,000 OpenAI employees are eligible for the bonus, according to a report by The Verge. The ChatGPT-maker is currently valued at $300 billion. While the exact bonus amounts are not known, it will likely depend on the role and seniority of qualified employees, with the highest million-dollar payouts reportedly going to OpenAI’s prized AI researchers, who already draw salaries worth millions of dollars every year. The engineers, on the other hand, will reportedly receive bonuses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars on average, the report said. However, these bonuses are not likely to be paid out at once. Instead, it will be disbursed over the next two years with qualified workers having the option to receive the money in OpenAI stock, cash, or both. “As we mentioned a few weeks ago, we have been looking at comp for our technical teams given the movement in the market,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was quoted as saying by The Verge. “We very much intend to keep increasing comp as we keep doing better and better as a company. But we wanted to be transparent about this one since it’s a new thing for us,” Altman added. This is reportedly the first time that OpenAI has offered bonuses to such a large number of employees, about one-third of the company’s full workforce. The move comes against the backdrop of a rapidly intensifying war for AI talent. Several companies have poached OpenAI researchers with lucrative offers, and Meta has led the charge. Since the one-time special bonus does not apply to all employees, OpenAI risks losing more workers, who may feel overlooked, to other companies. Mark Chen, OpenAI’s research officer, has previously likened Meta’s aggressive poaching spree to a home invasion. Shengjia Zhao, one of the creators of ChatGPT, was recently named as the chief scientist of Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Besides Meta, Elon Musk’s xAI has also reportedly been making aggressive offers to lure away OpenAI’s top talent. Thinking Machines, an AI rival lab started by ex-OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, also comprises several of OpenAI’s technical staff. Meanwhile, OpenAI also reportedly plans to allow current and former employees to cash out with millions by selling their vested stock to investors. However, Altman has reportedly said that employees might be able to sell at a much higher share price than the current $274 per share at a higher valuation of $500 billion, according to a report by Bloomberg.
