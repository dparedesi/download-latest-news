OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. Shares of Broadcom rose more than 10%. The companies said on Monday that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million U.S. households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. Most analysts do not expect the deal, the latest effort by a tech company to develop custom AI chips, to challenge Nvidia’s grip on the AI accelerator market, given the significant challenge of designing, scaling and manufacturing in-house chips from the ground up. The OpenAI-Broadcom deal is the latest in a string of massive chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry’s surging appetite for computing power as it races to build the most sophisticated AI systems. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data-center systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. A one-gigawatt data center can cost between $50 billion and $60 billion, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in August, adding that Nvidia products, powering the data center, can represent more than half of those costs. The 2026 timeline set out by OpenAI for the build-out is aggressive, but the startup is also best positioned to raise the funds required for the project, given the heights of investor confidence, said Gadjo Sevilla, an analyst at eMarketer. “Financing such a large chip deal will likely require a combination of funding rounds, pre-orders, strategic investments, and support from Microsoft, as well as leveraging future revenue streams and potential credit facilities.” The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on costly, supply-constrained Nvidia processors. However, similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports. Still, the rise in demand for custom chips has turned Broadcom into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. Broadcom unveiled a $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer, which some analysts speculated was OpenAI. However, a company executive on Monday alluded that OpenAI was not that unnamed client. Broadcom and OpenAI said on Monday that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom’s Ethernet and other networking gear, challenging Nvidia’s InfiniBand networking solution. A moving AC sleeper bus caught fire on the Jaisalmer-Jodhpur Highway, leaving around 20 people dead and many others with severe burns. The bus, carrying 57 passengers, caught fire due to a short circuit and quickly engulfed in flames. The Jaisalmer District Collector has requested family members to identify the deceased.

Title: Carbon credits are failing to help with climate change — here’s why

Achieving the global temperature targets set in the Paris climate agreement requires deep, rapid cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions, and therefore the swift phase-out of fossil fuels. Many factors stand in the way. One of the most pernicious is carbon offsets. Offsets are tradable credits from projects that claim to reduce emissions, either by avoiding them or by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Businesses and countries trade these credits — each representing the equivalent of one tonne of CO2 — to ‘neutralize’ their own emissions. Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Net zero needs AI — five actions to realize its promise Although conceptually appealing, this reliance on offsets has fatal flaws. In practice, it’s difficult to ensure that they represent real emissions reductions rather than ‘hot air’, with the claimed climate benefits existing only on paper. Equally challenging is ensuring that emission reductions are ‘additional’, meaning that they would not have occurred without the incentive provided by the sale of carbon credits. For projects credited for sequestering carbon, it is also crucial to ensure that the CO2 is locked away permanently and not released back into the atmosphere later. Most carbon-offset schemes fall foul of one or more of these requirements. Thus, offsets undermine decarbonization by enabling companies and countries to claim that emissions have been reduced when they have not. This results in more emissions, delays the phase-out of fossil fuels and diverts scarce resources to false solutions. Yet, climate-policy processes continue to rely on them. The operationalization of Article 6 of the Paris agreement and full implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation, both achieved in 2024, are set to turbocharge demand for carbon credits. In parallel, voluntary carbon markets are promising to raise standards as a way of further legitimizing and scaling up offsets. Of greatest concern is the expanding role of offsets in domestic carbon-pricing schemes, such as emissions trading and carbon taxes. Although the European Union’s Emissions Trading System phased out offsets in 2020, they still feature in most major carbon-pricing schemes outside Europe, including in China, Korea, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, California, Canada and Australia. They are even permitted as a substitute for paying carbon taxes in countries such as South Africa, Mexico, Chile and Colombia. Such practices threaten to undermine global decarbonization efforts. Low-quality offsets artificially depress carbon prices, which dilutes the incentive for industries to cut their emissions and weakens the effectiveness of carbon-pricing schemes. Here, we outline the problems and call on decision makers to exclude offsets from carbon-pricing schemes. Carbon offsetting sounds simple on paper. In practice, it is anything but. It is extremely difficult to evaluate the emission reductions achieved by offset projects because calculations require comparing outcomes with ‘business-as-usual’ projections. For example, calculating the climate benefits from a project that avoids deforestation involves comparing a forest’s actual carbon stock to that in a counterfactual scenario in which the project did not happen. The hypothetical nature of such calculations invites manipulation and can tempt project developers to overestimate business-as-usual emissions to generate more credits. Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Heatwaves linked to carbon emissions from specific companies Fundamental imbalances in the information used in offset schemes leave them vulnerable to these outcomes. In most cases, only project leaders and developers know whether their projects are dependent on credit revenues and are therefore truly additional. This makes it difficult for administrators to screen out shoddy projects. Even where projects are additional, errors can arise from inaccurate measurement of emissions and carbon stocks. These risks are most acute when the sources and sinks are variable. For example, stocks of soil organic carbon vary naturally across landscapes and through time. This is a product of diversity in soil characteristics, topography and vegetation cover, as well as in seasonal, annual and decadal changes in temperatures and rainfall. The variability makes it difficult to accurately measure changes in the carbon stock and ensure that the credited carbon storage is fully attributable to the project1. It is also difficult to ensure that credited carbon removals remain sequestered. Many carbon sinks are susceptible to natural disturbances, such as droughts and wildfires, which can release carbon stored in trees and soils. Carbon stocks can also be lost through the clearing of vegetation and other changes in land-management practices. Despite these risks, most offset schemes mandate that credited sinks be maintained for only 40 years or even less. Given that CO2 emissions require thousands of years to be reabsorbed by Earth’s climate system2, credited removals need to lock away carbon for a similar period to genuinely neutralize the warming caused by the emissions that are claimed to be offset. In most markets, the risks associated with the supply of low-quality goods and services can be alleviated if consumers are able to judge quality and seek redress when standards are not met. With offsets, however, the complexity and a lack of transparency make it close to impossible for buyers to make informed decisions about the quality of most credits. Moreover, many buyers are not incentivized to care. Typically, their priority is to procure credits at the lowest possible cost, a fact evidenced by a 2024 study revealing that the largest corporate buyers consistently choose low-priced credits over higher-quality alternatives3. Why the green-technology race might not save the planet Why the green-technology race might not save the planet For these reasons, the integrity of offset schemes hinges on the skills and efforts of administrators, but they are often incentivized to prioritize supply over integrity. In voluntary offset markets, registries rely on project registrations and credit issuances for revenue, while competing with one another for market share. Tightening integrity standards can therefore reduce revenue and put this business model at risk. Government-regulated offset programmes linked to carbon-pricing schemes show a similar dynamic. The main reason that pricing schemes allow the use of offsets is to lower compliance costs for polluters, thereby reducing resistance to climate policies4. Yet the focus on cost reduction places pressure on regulators to ensure a plentiful supply of low-cost credits, frequently at the expense of environmental integrity. These interlinked issues make integrity failings inevitable. The science reflects this, with studies repeatedly showing that few of the major offset types in use today deliver real, additional or permanent abatement. A 2024 meta-analysis examining some 2,300 offset projects — amounting to around one-fifth of all issued credits — found that less than 16% achieved the emissions reductions claimed by developers5. In-depth evaluations of avoided deforestation6, renewable energy7 and clean cooking-stove projects8 have also exposed persistent problems with additionality, inaccurate measurement and impermanence. Recognizing these flaws, some stakeholders advocate a shift from projects that avoid emissions to those that remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, carbon-removal projects tend to have similar integrity problems. Engineering-based techniques are scarce, and so most removal projects currently involve less durable nature-based approaches, such as tree planting, improved soil management and production of biochar (plant-derived charcoal). And just as with emissions-avoidance projects, studies reveal persistent integrity failings, particularly regarding the crediting of non-existent and non-additional removals9,10. Bad offsets cheat the climate by failing to deliver their promised emission reductions. And they do further damage by distorting carbon-pricing schemes. Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them Six roadblocks to net zero — and how to get around them In a well-functioning emissions trading scheme, the carbon price will reflect the marginal cost of reducing emissions, whether at a polluting facility or through an offset project. When offsets lack integrity, credit prices reflect the cost of supplying pretend, rather than real, emission reductions, which artificially lowers the carbon price. The same is true for carbon taxes: low-integrity credits reduce the carbon price faced by polluters by allowing them to surrender cheap credits in place of paying the tax. or

UPDATED 19:15 EDT / OCTOBER 13 2025 by Maria Deutscher JPMorgan Chase & Co. today announced plans to invest up to $10 billion in technology and infrastructure companies. The news sent several quantum computer makers’ shares soaring more than 20%. JPMorgan will invest mainly in U.S. companies with the goal of supporting their engineering and manufacturing operations. The bank will make the investments as part of a new program, the Security and Resiliency Initiative, through which it plans to support “industries critical to national economic security and resiliency.” In addition to investing its own capital, the bank will provide participating companies with $1.5 trillion worth of financing over 10 years, 50% more than what it had planned to offer before. The Security and Resiliency Initiative will focus on 27 different areas that the bank has organized into four categories. The first category, which JPMorgan calls frontier and strategic technologies, includes five technology verticals including quantum computing. Shares of quantum computer developers D-Wave Quantum Inc. and IonQ Inc. rose more than 20% on the news, while Quantum Computing Inc. closed 12% higher. It’s possible JPMorgan’s interest in the quantum technology market isn’t limited solely to computers. The bank listed sensor hardware as a focus of its new investment initiative. Many of the most advanced sensors in development today use quantum mechanical phenomena, such as the behavior of low-temperature atoms, to detect environmental changes. IonQ, one of the quantum computer makers that logged stock price gains today, entered the quantum sensor market earlier this year. Alongside its frontier and strategic technologies category, JPMorgan plans to invest in three other areas. They include supply chain and advanced manufacturing, defense and aerospace and energy independence and resilience. Those categories also include technology-related subfields. JPMorgan’s supply chain and advanced manufacturing investment plan, for example, will partly focus on companies developing autonomous mobile robots. The bank will also seek to back chipmaking equipment providers. In the energy sector, battery storage is among the technologies that JPMorgan lists as a priority. The Wall Street heavyweight will hire bankers, investment professionals and other experts to support its new financing initiative. It will also appoint an external advisory council to help guide the program. “Our security is predicated on the strength and resiliency of America’s economy,” said JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. “America needs more speed and investment.” Another major financial institution, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is also sharpening its focus on the tech sector. The investment bank today announced plans to acquire San Francisco-based venture capital firm Industry Ventures for $665 million in cash and equity. Goldman Sachs will pay an additional $300 million through 2030 if certain performance goals are met. Industry Ventures has 45 staffers who manage $7 billion worth of assets. The firm has backed Meta Platforms Inc., Uber Technologies Inc. and other major consumer tech firms over the past 25 years. Its portfolio also includes enterprise software companies such as Datadog Inc., a publicly traded observability provider.

Title: Is the AI Conveyor Belt of Capital About to Stop?

reading time 8 minutes The American economy is little more than a big bet on AI. Morgan Stanley investor Ruchir Sharma recently noted that money poured into AI investments now accounts for about 40% of the United Statesâ GDP growth in 2025, and AI companies are responsible for 80% of growth in American stocks. So how bad is it that the most recent major deal among AI giants, agreements that have driven up stock prices dramatically, look like a snake eating its own tail? In recent months, Nvidia announced that it would invest $100 billion into OpenAI, OpenAI announced that it would pay $300 billion to Oracle for computing power, and Oracle announced it would buy $40 billion worth of chips from Nvidia. It doesnât take a flow chart to get the feeling that these firms are just moving money around between each other. But surely thatâs not happeningâ¦right? Itâs a little harder to get assurances of that than you might think.Â Many of these agreements are, on their face, mutually beneficial. If everything is on the level, while these deals might be circular, they should be moving everything forward. Rishi Jaluria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, told Gizmodo that deals like these could result in a âless capacity-constrained world,â which would allow for faster development of models that could produce higher returns on investment. âThe better models we have, the more we can realize a lot of these AI use cases that are on hold just because the technology isnât powerful enough yet to handle it,â he said. âIf that happens, and that can generate real [return on investment] for customers â¦ that results in real cost savings, potentially new revenue generation opportunities, and that creates net benefits from a GDP perspective.â So as long as we keep having AI breakthroughs and these companies figure out how to monetize their products, everything should be fine. On the off chance that doesnât happen, though?Â âIf that doesn’t happen, if there is no real enterprise AI adoption, then it’s all round-tripping,â Jaluria said. Round-tripping, generally speaking, refers to the unethical and typically illegal practice of making trades or transactions to artificially prop up a particular asset or company, making it look like itâs more valuable and in demand than it actually is. In this case, it would be tech companies that are trying to make it appear like they are more valuable than they actually are by announcing big deals with each other that move the stock price.Â So what might suggest whether this money is actually accomplishing anything other than serving as hot air in a rapidly inflating bubble? Jaluria said heâs watching for faster developments of models, advancements in performance, and overall AI adoption. âIf this leads to a step function change in the way enterprise is adopting and utilizing AI, that creates a benefit,â he said. Whether that is happening currently or not is kind of in the eye of the beholder. OpenAI has certainly shown advancements in its technology. The release of its Sora 2 video generation model has unleashed a fresh hell upon the world, used to generate significant amounts of copyright violations and misinformation. But the latest version of the companyâs flagship model, GPT-5, underwhelmed and failed to live up to expectations when it was released in August.Â Adoption rates of the technology are also a bit of a Rorschach test. The company boasts that 10% of the world is using ChatGPT, and nearly 80% of the business world says that itâs looking into how to utilize the technology. But the early adopters arenât finding much utility. According to a survey from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 95% of companies that have tried to integrate generative AI tools into their operations have produced zero return on investment. Where these investments are generating a return is in the stock market. Which, frankly, does not quell concerns about these firms simply boosting one anotherâs bottom line. Take Oracle, for example. Last month, the cloud provider had aÂ rough quarter by all traditional indicators. It missed on both its revenue and earnings projections, and its net income was flat year-over-year. And yet, the stock price soared. The reason: the company’s plump list of remaining performance obligationsâfinancial agreements that will provide revenue that have not yet been fulfilled. There, the company showed a massive amount of growth, a 359% increase from the year prior, with a projected $455 billion coming in.Â That money is not real yet. Nor is the growth the company has promised, claiming that its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue would grow from under $20 billion to nearly $150 billion before the start of the 2030s. But all of it was sufficient for investors to drive up Oracle’s share price enough to slingshot CEO Larry Ellison into the top spot on the world’s richest person list, briefly leapfrogging Elon Musk.Â Most of this promised revenue will come from OpenAI, which made a commitment to purchase $300 billion worth of computing power from the company over five years. The clock on that contract doesn’t start until 2027, but assuming it actually happens, it would be one of the largest cloud computing deals in history. It’s also one of the most unlikely, just based on where the companies involved currently stand. In order to provide the compute that it has promised to OpenAI, Oracle will reportedly need to generate 4.5 gigawatts of power capacity, more than two Hoover Dams’ worth of power. On the other side of the deal, OpenAI will have to pay about $60 billion per year to fit the bill for the agreement. It currently generates about $10 billion in revenue, which, statistically speaking, is less than $60 billion. You can see a similar circular shape to OpenAIâs recent deal with Nvidia rival AMD, too. The exact details of the agreement werenât reported, but chipmaker AMD expects to generate tens of billions of dollars over the next half-decade as it sells its AI chips to OpenAI. As part of the agreement, OpenAI gets a swath of shares in AMD, with options to buy up to 10% of the company. Lucky for OpenAI, thereâs really no better time to get your hands on some AMD shares than right before it announces a big AI-related deal. The companyâs stock price surged by about 35% following the announcement.Â With those two most recent deals on the books, OpenAI has agreed to more than $1 trillion worth of computing deals so far this year. Thatâs a lot for any company to spend, but itâs especially a lot for a still-private company that reports just $10 billion in projected revenue through 2025. Even by its most recent funding rounds, the company as a whole is currently valued at about $500 billion. Most of those deals have contingencies attached. For instance, Nvidiaâs investment in OpenAI isnât actually $100 billion, but an initial $10 billion for one gigawatt of data center capacity with the potential for $100 billion if 10 gigawatts are ultimately achieved. But the stock prices and valuations certainly seem to treat these deals as if they are set in stone. And OpenAI seems to be operating that way, too. The company claims that itâll more than 10x its revenue in the next few years, and projects itâll hit $129 billion annually by 2029. That type of potentially inflated revenue figure is the kind of thing that makes some people think of the Dot Com bubble of the early 2000s, where we saw companies like Commerce One receive a $21 billion valuation despite barely having any revenue. But Peter Atwater, Adjunct Professor of Economics at William and Mary and President of consulting firm Financial Insyghts, sees a different reflection in the AI bubble: the housing market collapse.Â âWhat we saw at the top of the mortgage market was all of these conveyor belts of capital, money flowing from one party to another party to another party. And what you started to see was that there were multiple points of relationship so that any participant in the system was then dependent on every other conveyor belt in the system working simultaneously to keep the system going,â he told Gizmodo. âIn many ways, we’re seeing the same developing web of capital flows across the AI space.â This creates some obvious problems. The circular deals that, in theory, are wheels moving the whole thing forward all have to keep turning. If any of them stop, the whole thing stops, because they are all so interconnected that no failure is truly isolated.Â Atwater said that the types of major, metric-contingent deals that have been dominating headlines in the AI space arenât all that different from some of what was happening in the mortgage industry back in 2007, where some of the financial commitments required mortgages to meet certain conditions. âIn the frenzy of a bubble, everyone overcommits. The purpose of overcommitting is to stake a claim in what you believe will be an intensely scarce commodity in the future. So you have buyers overcommit and you have sellers agreeing to overprovide as a result,â he explained. âWhat we find over and over is that commitments are among the first obligations to be cut off once conditions change, once confidence begins to fall.â Right now, thereâs a stomach for those commitments. That isnât guaranteed to be there in the future if all of these promised returns on investment donât materialize. Atwater said that the market requires credit markets being willing to continue to extend massive sums of money to cover the agreements made, equity markets that value these transactions at âan extraordinary multiple,â and suppliers capable of delivering the promised products. Thereâs no guarantee that all of those factors will hold.Â The math is already pretty tricky. As tech commentator Ed Zitron has pointed out, major firms like Microsoft, Meta, Tesla, Amazon, and Google have invested about $560 billion in AI infrastructure over the last two years. Theyâve brought in a combined $35 billion in AI-related revenue. OpenAIâs commitments are even bigger, with returns that are arguably even smaller.Â The companyâs development and expansion of its services will rely in no small part on massive data center projects, which will require the same amount of energy to operate as New York City and San Diego combinedâenergy that currently isnât even available. And, once again, there is no guarantee that the end product, once all of that energy is spent and data centers are built, will actually generate revenue. âUltimately, if you do not have a consumer for the product, there will be no AI space because these companies can’t continue to do this for nothing. Listening to a lot of the calls in the last couple of weeks, there’s a clear open question as to how these companies are going to make money at this,â Atwater said. For the moment, everyone is seeing green, and hope springs eternal. As long as that is the case, no one will ask where the revenue is coming from. âRight now, the AI sector is operating in a forever mindset. They are acting as if they have a very long period of time under which they can figure this out and make money,â Atwater said. âAs long as confidence is high, this entire ecosystem can offer fantasy. When confidence falls, they’re going to be expected to deliver real-term performance in a very short time frame.â Unfortunately, should that happen, it wonât just be these companies that bear the brunt of the failure. âYou have to look at this as a larger ecosystem. To talk about AI today, it means we have to talk about the credit market, we have to talk about the credit market. Wall Street and AI are a single beast,â Atwater said, warning that a very small number of firms currently have a major grasp on the whole of the American economy.Â Lots of investors are piling into the AI space, fearful of missing out on a market that seems like it can only go up. But few of them are looking at why those valuations and stock prices keep climbing, showing little curiosity as to what might happen if all of this money is just getting shifted around, artificially inflating the actual value of the companies they are betting on.Â ââWhy?â,â Atwater said, “is the last question asked in a bull market.” Explore more on these topics Share this story Subscribe and interact with our community, get up to date with our customised Newsletters and much more.

Title: The A.I. Boom and the Spectre of 1929

As stocks plummeted on the morning of October 24th, 1929, a large crowd gathered on Wall Street outside of the New York Stock Exchange. Pat Bologna, a local shoeshiner whose life savings were invested in the market, dodged into a packed brokerage nearby. “Everybody is shouting,” he later recalled. “They’re all trying to reach the glass booth where the clerks are. Everybody wants to sell out. The boy at the quotation board is running scared. He can’t keep up with the speed of the way stocks are dropping. The board’s painted green. The guy who runs it is Irish. He’s standing at the back of the booth, on the telephone. I can’t hear what he’s saying. But a guy near me shouts, ‘the sonofabitch has sold me out!’ ” The stock-market crash of 1929 occupies a dark but indelible place in the national imagination, and for good reason. In the age of online trading and algorithmic traders, the next stock crash, whenever it comes, will be a largely digital phenomenon. But its consequences will certainly play out in the analog world: wealth destruction, human anguish, fallout in the rest of the economy. On Wall Street, as the speculative A.I. boom continues to grow, even some financial titans are acknowledging that it might not end well. “There will be a check at some point, there will be a drawdown,” David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said at a recent conference. Last week, Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, told the BBC that he was “far more worried” than others about the possibility of a big fall in the market. A few days later, when Donald Trump threatened to impose new tariffs on China, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dived nine hundred points, only to rebound on Monday after Trump softened his rhetoric. Perhaps the most alarming feature of the 1929 crash was that it wasn’t a one-off. After peaking in September, 1929, the Dow Jones Industrial Average entered a downward trend that lasted nearly three years; by July of 1932, it had sunk by about ninety per cent. The crash’s giddy prequel, dramatic unfolding, and shattering aftermath—the Great Depression—has long provided compelling material for writers. In 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen, of Harper’s Magazine, described in his book “Only Yesterday” the speculative frenzy that preceded the crash: “Stories of fortunes made overnight were on everybody’s lips. . . . Wives were asking their husbands why they were so slow, why they weren’t getting in on all this, only to hear that their husbands had bought a hundred shares of American Linseed that very morning.” Almost a quarter century later, John Kenneth Galbraith brought an economist’s eye and a dry wit to the subject with “The Great Crash 1929.” The book detailed how, in the summer of that year, when stock prices were already sky-high, the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, in partnership with the utility baron Harrison Williams, launched two huge investment trusts, the Shenandoah Corporation and the Blue Ridge Corporation, which employed leverage—that is, borrowed money—and a pyramid structure to magnify investors’ gains (or, as it turned out, their losses). “If there must be madness something may be said for having it on a heroic scale,” Galbraith wrote. In 1979, the fiftieth anniversary of the crash, the co-authors Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan-Witts published “The Day the Bubble Burst,” which included the anecdote about the shoeshiner. Now, four years before the hundredth anniversary, comes “1929,” a new book by Andrew Ross Sorkin, a financial columnist for the Times and a co-anchor on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” As in Sorkin’s previous book, “Too Big to Fail,” a best-selling account of the financial crisis of 2008, he focusses mainly on the financiers and policymakers at the center of the crisis, drawing on private letters, transcripts, oral histories, architectural plans, memoirs, newspaper accounts, corporate filings, and prior histories. His narrative extends from February of 1929 to well beyond the crash, to the failed efforts of Herbert Hoover to revive a stricken economy; the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt; the U.S. Senate’s famous Pecora Commission, which exposed a great deal of Wall Street self-dealing; and the passage of the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, which curbed some of the Street’s excesses by separating commercial banking (making loans and taking deposits) from investment banking (selling and dealing in securities). Other reforms introduced under Roosevelt included the founding of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had a mandate to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets, and the federal insurance of bank deposits, which ended a calamitous wave of bank runs. In historical terms, the 1929 crash and the election of F.D.R. marked the dividing line between the untrammelled financial capitalism that had emerged during the Gilded Age in the late nineteenth century, and the managed capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. For several decades, this system delivered strong economic growth and a more equal income distribution, until inflation upended it and ushered in the neoliberal era of financial deregulation. (In 1999, Bill Clinton signed into law the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which repealed key parts of Glass-Steagall.) During the nineteen-twenties, Sorkin writes, “Wall Street became like a giant balloon floating above the common people, its self-mythologizing leaders enjoying the comforts of what felt like a privileged realm.” His leading characters include Charles Mitchell, the chairman of National City Bank, a predecessor of Citibank, who, in March of 1929, resisted efforts by the Federal Reserve to restrict bank lending to speculators in the market; Thomas Lamont, a senior partner at J. P. Morgan & Co., who, during the panic selling on October 24th, organized a futile effort to stabilize the market; and Jesse Livermore, a storied speculator who made and lost several fortunes before eventually shooting himself in the cloakroom of the Sherry-Netherland hotel. There are cameos by everyone from Al Smith and William Randolph Hearst to Winston Churchill and Groucho Marx, both of whom speculated heavily in the market and paid the price. No two speculative booms are exactly alike, of course, but they share some common elements. Typically, there is great excitement among investors about new technology—in today’s case, A.I.—and its potential to boost profits for companies positioned to take advantage of it. In the twenties, commercial radio was a novel and revolutionary medium: tens of millions of Americans tuned in. Sorkin points out that, between 1921 and 1928, stock in Radio Corporation of America, the Nvidia of its day, went from $1 ½ to $85 ½. Another hallmark of a stock bubble is that, at some point, its participants largely give up on conventional valuation measures and buy in simply because prices are rising and everybody else is doing it: FOMO rules the day. By some metrics, valuations were even higher during the late-nineteen-nineties internet stock bubble than they were in the late twenties. And according to the latest report from the Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee, which was released last week, valuations in the U.S. market are, by one measure, “comparable to the peak of the dot-com bubble.” That’s true according to the cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio, which tracks stock prices relative to corporate earnings averaged over the previous ten years. If, instead of looking back, you focus on predictions of future earnings, valuations are less stretched: the Bank of England report noted that they remain “below the levels reached during the dot-com bubble.” But that’s just another way of saying that investors are betting on earnings growing rapidly in the coming years. And this is a moment when many companies have so far seen precious little return for their A.I. investments. To be sure, not everyone agrees that stock prices have departed from reality. In a note to clients last week, analysts at Goldman Sachs said the market’s rise, which is heavily concentrated in Big Tech stocks, “has, so far, been driven by fundamental growth rather than irrational speculation.” Jensen Huang, the chief executive of Nvidia, whose chips power A.I. systems at companies such as OpenAI, Google, and Meta, said that he believed the world was at “the beginning of a new industrial revolution.” However, even the authors of the Goldman report acknowledged that there are elements of the current situation “that rhyme with previous bubbles,” including the big gains in stock prices and the emergence of questionable financing schemes. Last month, Nvidia announced it would invest up to one hundred billion dollars over the next decade in OpenAI, the parent company of ChatGPT, which is already a big purchaser of Nvidia’s chips and will likely need more to power its expansion. Nvidia has said OpenAI isn’t obligated to spend the money it invests on Nvidia chips, but the deal, and others like it, have sparked comparisons to the dot-com bubble, when some big tech companies engaged in so-called “circular” transactions that ultimately didn’t work out. Another recurring feature of the biggest asset booms is outright chicanery, such as fraudulent accounting, the marketing of worthless securities, and plain old stealing. Galbraith referred to this phenomenon as “the bezzle.” In hard times, he noted, creditors are tight-fisted and audits are scrupulous: as a result, “commercial morality is enormously improved.” In boom times, creditors are more trusting, lending standards get debased, and borrowed money is plentiful. But there “are always many people who need more,” Galbraith explained, and “the bezzle increases rapidly,” as it did in the late twenties. “Just as the boom accelerated the rate of growth,” he went on, “so the crash enormously advanced the rate of discovery.” Sorkin traces the fates of Albert Wiggin and Richard Whitney, who, at the time of the crash were, respectively, the C.E.O. of Chase National Bank and the vice-president of the New York Stock Exchange. Both men were involved in the failed effort, orchestrated by Lamont, to stabilize the market. In 1932, Wiggin went on to become a director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But, during the Pecora investigation, which began that same year, it emerged that, beginning in September of 1929, Wiggin had secretly shorted the stock of his own bank, using a pair of companies he owned to make the trades. He was forced to resign from the Fed. In 1930, Whitney, the scion of a prominent New England family, became the president of the stock exchange, but he was ultimately exposed as an embezzler and served more than three years in Sing Sing. On being reminded of stories like these, it’s tempting to cast the leaders of nineteen-twenties Wall Street as a bunch of crooks. Sorkin resists the impulse. In an afterword, he writes, “The difficulty is that, other than the disgraced Richard Whitney and Albert Wiggin, it is hard to make the case that any of the era’s other major financial figures did anything appreciably worse than most individuals would have done in their positions and circumstances.” Given the role that Wall Street’s élite played in inflating and promoting the bubble, this is either a generous view or a jaded commentary on the fallen nature of mankind. In any case, though, it’s true that speculative booms tend to take on a life of their own, creating incentives and opportunities that warp people’s judgment at all levels of the economy, from small investors and professional intermediaries to major corporate and financial institutions. One aspect of the current boom that hasn’t received sufficient attention is how it has extended from the stock market to the credit markets, where there has been enormous growth in so-called “private lending” by non-bank institutions, including private-equity companies, hedge funds, and specialized credit firms. Last week, news organizations reported that the Department of Justice had opened an investigation into the collapse of First Brands, an acquisitive Cleveland-based auto-parts firm that, with Wall Street’s help, had apparently raised billions of dollars in opaque transactions. One creditor told a bankruptcy court that up to $2.3 billion in collateral had “simply vanished,” and called for the appointment of an independent examiner. A lawyer for First Brands said the company denied any wrongdoing and attributed the collapse to “macroeconomic factors” beyond its control. The sudden demise of a single highly leveraged company that operated in a sector far from the A.I. frontier may be a one-off event, with no broader implications. Or it could conceivably be a harbinger of what lies ahead. We won’t know for a while—perhaps a good while. But in the words of the nineteenth-century English journalist Walter Bagehot, whom Galbraith quoted, “every great crisis reveals the excessive speculations of many houses which no one before suspected.” This time is unlikely to be different. ♦

Title: OpenAI-Broadcom agreement sends shares of chipmaker soaring
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/openai-broadcom-chipmaker-artificial-intelligence-data-center/
Time Published: 2025-10-13T16:08:52Z

Broadcom Inc. shares jumped after OpenAI agreed to buy the company’s custom chips and networking equipment in a multiyear deal, part of an ambitious plan by the startup to add artificial intelligence infrastructure. In a pact announced Monday, OpenAI agreed to buy custom chips and networking components from Broadcom to help power its artificial intelligence services. OpenAI had already struck deals for data centers and chips that easily top $1 trillion, and the company plans to spend tens of billions of dollars more on Broadcom chips, according to people familiar with the matter. By customizing the processors, OpenAI said it will be able to embed what it has learned from developing AI models and services “directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” The hardware rollout should be completed by the end of 2029, according to the companies. For Broadcom, the move provides deeper access to the booming AI market. Monday’s agreement confirms an arrangement that Broadcom Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan had hinted at during an earnings conference call last month. Investors sent Broadcom shares up as as much as 11% on Monday, betting that the OpenAI alliance will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in new revenue for the chipmaker. But the details of how OpenAI will pay for the equipment aren’t spelled out. While the AI startup has shown it can easily raise funding from investors, it’s burning through wads of cash and doesn’t expect to be cash-flow positive until around the end of this decade. OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has inked a number of blockbuster deals this year, aiming to ease constraints on computing power. Nvidia Corp., whose chips handle the majority of AI work, said last month that it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new infrastructure — with a goal of at least 10 GW of capacity. And just last week, OpenAI announced a pact to deploy 6 GW of Advanced Micro Device Inc. processors over multiple years. As AI and cloud companies announce large projects every few days, it’s often not clear how the efforts are being financed. The interlocking deals also have boosted fears of a bubble in AI spending, particularly as many of these partnerships involve OpenAI, a fast-growing but unprofitable business. While purchasing chips from others, OpenAI has also been working on designing its own semiconductors. They’re mainly intended to handle the inference stage of running AI models — the phase after the technology is trained. There’s no investment or stock component to the Broadcom deal, OpenAI said, making it different than the agreements with Nvidia and AMD. An OpenAI spokesperson declined to comment on how the company will finance the chips, but the underlying idea is that more computing power will let the company sell more services. A single gigawatt of AI computing capacity today costs roughly $35 billion for the chips alone, with 10 GW totaling upwards of $350 billion. But a chief reason OpenAI is working to develop its own chip is to bring down its costs, and it’s unclear what price Broadcom’s chips will command under the deal. OpenAI might be trying to emulate Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which made its own chips using Broadcom’s technology and saw lower costs compared with other AI companies, such as Meta Platforms Inc., according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Google’s success with Broadcom might have steered OpenAI to that chipmaker, rather than suppliers such as Marvell Technology Inc., Singh added. In announcing the agreement, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said that his company has been working with Broadcom for 18 months. The startup is rethinking technology starting with the transistors and going all the way up to what happens when someone asks ChatGPT a question, he said on a podcast released by his company. “By being able to optimize across that entire stack, we can get huge efficiency gains, and that will lead to much better performance, faster models, cheaper models.” When Tan referred to the agreement last month, he didn’t name the customer, though people familiar with the matter identified it as OpenAI. “If you do your own chips, you control your destiny,” Tan said in the podcast Monday. Broadcom has increasingly been seen as a key beneficiary of AI spending, helping propel its share price this year. The stock was up 40% so far this year through Friday’s close, outpacing a 29% gain by the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index. OpenAI, meanwhile, has garnered a $500 billion valuation, making it the world’s biggest startup by that measure. By tapping Broadcom’s networking technology, OpenAI is hedging its bets. Broadcom’s Ethernet-based options compete with Nvidia’s proprietary technology. OpenAI also will be designing its own gear as part of its work on custom hardware, the startup said. Broadcom won’t be providing the data center capacity itself. Instead, it will deploy server racks with custom hardware to facilities run by either OpenAI or its cloud-computing partners. A single gigawatt is about the capacity of a conventional nuclear power plant. Still, 10 GW of computing power alone isn’t enough to support OpenAI’s vision of achieving artificial general intelligence, said OpenAI co-founder and President Greg Brockman. “That is a drop in the bucket compared to where we need to go,” he said. Getting to the level under discussion isn’t going to happen quickly, said Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group. “Take railroads — it took about a century to roll it out as critical infrastructure. If you take the internet, it took about 30 years,” he said. “This is not going to take five years.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

OpenAI has partnered with Broadcom to produce its first in-house artificial intelligence processors, the latest chip tie-up for the ChatGPT maker as it races to secure the computing power needed to meet surging demand for its services. The companies said today that OpenAI would design the chips, which Broadcom will develop and deploy starting in the second half of 2026. They will roll out 10 gigawatts' worth of custom chips, whose power consumption is roughly equivalent to the needs of more than 8 million US households or five times the electricity produced by the Hoover Dam. The agreement is the latest in a string of massive AI chip investments that have highlighted the technology industry's surging appetite for computing power as it races to build systems that meet or surpass human intelligence. OpenAI last week unveiled a 6-gigawatt AI chip supply deal with AMD that includes an option to buy a stake in the chipmaker, days after disclosing that Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in the startup and provide it with data centre systems with at least 10 gigawatts of capacity. "Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI's potential," OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. Financial details of the agreement were not disclosed and it was not immediately clear how OpenAI would fund the deal. The tie-up with Broadcom, first reported by Reuters last year, places OpenAI among cloud-computing giants such as Alphabet-owned Google and Amazon.com that are developing custom chips to meet surging AI demand and reduce dependence on Nvidia's costly processors that are limited in supply. The approach is not a sure bet. Similar efforts by Microsoft and Meta have run into delays or failed to match the performance of Nvidia chips, according to media reports, and analysts believe custom chips do not pose a threat to Nvidia's dominance in the short term. The rise of custom chips has, however, turned Broadcom - long known for its networking hardware - into one of the biggest winners of the generative AI boom, with its stock price rising nearly six-fold since the end of 2022. The company unveiled a blockbuster $10 billion custom AI chip order in September from an unnamed new customer that some analysts and market watchers speculated was OpenAI. Broadcom and OpenAI said today that the deployment of the new custom chips would be completed by the end of 2029, building on their existing co-development and supply agreements. The new systems will be scaled entirely using Broadcom's Ethernet and other networking gear, giving the company an edge over smaller rivals such as Marvell Technology and challenging Nvidia's InfiniBand networking solution. © RTÉ 2025.

Title: Why Oracle Stock Rose 122% In 6 Months
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/13/why-oracle-stock-rose-122-in-6-months/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 122.2% change in Oracle (ORCL) stock between April 13, 2025, and October 10, 2025, was primarily driven by a 119.3% expansion in the company’s P/E multiple. There’s more to this story than numbers alone—but first, let’s break down the movement and its key contributors. Single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach we take with Trefis High Quality Portfolio. We go beyond just equities. Is a portfolio of 10% commodities, 10% gold, and 2% crypto in addition to equities and bonds - likely to return more during the next 1-3 years, and protect you better if markets crash 20%? We have crunched the numbers. Coming back to the "change": The change in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue and margins, has an underlying business and investor sentiment story behind it. Below, we have identified key developments that influenced stock price movement for ORCL stock. Before that, as a quick background: ORCL provides cloud software as a service, industry-specific cloud solutions, application licenses, license support, an enterprise database, a development language, and middleware services. Opinion: We currently find ORCL stock relatively expensive. Why so? Have a look at the full story. Read Buy or Sell ORCL Stock to see what drives our current opinion. Risk: That said, Oracle isn’t immune to big drops. It plunged nearly 77% in the Dot-Com Bubble and slid over 41% during the Global Financial Crisis. The Inflation Shock wasn’t kind either, with a 40% dip. Even the smaller events — 2018 Correction and Covid Pandemic — pushed it down around 19% and 29% respectively. Solid fundamentals matter, but when sell-offs hit, Oracle can see serious pullbacks. Picking winners on a consistent basis is not an easy task - especially given the volatility associated with a single stock. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

October 12, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 24th issue of our Weekly Report. Sorry for showing up in a cap today. I’ve been dealing with a very serious case of shingles on my head these past few days, which has affected my condition a bit. Everyone, please also take good care of your health and get enough rest. On EAI Flywheel this week, starting with S1 User Ecosystem: This week, FX signed a deposit agreement for 1,000 units of FX Super One with ZEVO, the pioneer of peer-to-peer EV sharing platform in the U.S. The agreement includes non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders, and the non-refundable deposit has already been received. The signing of this agreement not only marks that FX’s Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model has expanded into Texas, the second-largest EV market in the United States. It also represents another innovative breakthrough in our B2B2C sales model. Following the car rental, FX Par, real estate brokerage, and MCN agencies, FX has now also entered the rapidly growing peer-to-peer car-sharing market. Based in Dallas, ZEVO not only allows individual car owners to list their own EVs for user-to-user sharing but also provides flexible short-term rental programs for ride-hailing and instant-delivery drivers. Its business has now expanded to core cities in Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Through the cooperation with ZEVO, FX not only further expands the sales and use cases of FX Super One, but is also expected to speed up the implementation of our co-creation and sharing ecosystem. At the same time, when the car-sharing business and CXC10’s Three Growth Engines spark meta-chemistry — especially through the EAI + Crypto Dual-Bridge RWA products — new possibilities will emerge. The value of real-world mobility will be redefined and expanded in Web3 scenarios. This meta-chemistry could greatly accelerate the convergence of Web2 and Web3, and of EAI and Crypto, creating the greatest value for our stockholders. This week, we also held a "Car Home Crypto Co-Creation" delivery event with Pinnacle. Calvin Gong is our first Co-Creation Officer since we announced the “EAI + Crypto” Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. We look forward to creating meta-chemistry between real estate, automotive, and crypto together with industry leaders like Pinnacle. This could help us co-create greater value and enable users to share more benefits. Now going to S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: The FX Super One U.S. year-end vehicle off-line target has officially entered the final two-month sprint stage. This week, the company established a dedicated project team to coordinate and drive the work. Key areas — including engineering, supply chain, homologation, manufacturing and so on— are all accelerating across the board. On S6 Middle East: Our global teams are working across three locations in full force to prepare for the October 28th UAE Super One Product Final Launch. As the strategic third pole, the UAE will host its major Super One product launch for the first time and take the lead in initial vehicle deliveries — a milestone of great significance for FF and FX’s global strategic layout. The experience gained through this event will also help ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming vehicle off-line and final launch activities in the U.S. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up: This week, members of our government affairs team were invited to attend a gala in Washington D.C. that brought together political, media and entrepreneurial leaders from across the U.S. We continue to strengthen our government affairs capabilities, and they are making progress assisting the company in public sector engagement, policy incentives, tariff strategy, and more. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: Following the completion of the strategic investment in Qualigen (QLGN), the Crypto team has been advancing its business operations while accelerating the transition work. The special meeting of QLGN stockholders is currently scheduled for November 2025. If the transaction is approved, QLGN is expected to be rebranded as CXC10, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Crypto and AI operations for that company. Next week, we will announce a major milestone related to the first FX Super One vehicle off-line target in the United States. Please stay tuned for the update. Okay, I'll see you later.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to The New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model (LLM) developer raised a €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a U.S.-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open source LLM offers a less-expensive alternative to closed source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI chief technology officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Arkon Energy, is building data centers in the U.K. and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an additional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise LLM provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received an AU$330 million (approximately $215 million) in funding at an AU$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient “AI factory” in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in the $203 million funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May 2024, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In April, Nvidia participated in Runway’s $308 million round, which was led by General Atlantic and valued the startup developing generative AI models for media production at $3.55 billion, according to PitchBook data. The chipmaker has been an investor in since 2023. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Reka AI: In July, AI research lab Reka raised $110 million in a round that included Snowflake and Nvidia. The deal tripled the startup’s valuation to over $1 billion, according to Bloomberg. Update: The post has been updated to reflect that Nvidia is one of several meaningful investors in Reflection AI. This post was first published in January 2025.

Title: Are US stocks overvalued? What investors should know about the rally

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany, writes Mark Lister. THE FACTS It’s been a fantastic run for the United States sharemarket. The S&P 500 index is up 18% in the past 12 months, and 83% over three years. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has commented on this, noting that “equity prices are fairly highly valued” during a recent speech. To be fair, he was responding to a question, rather than feeling the need to proactively offer an opinion. For the record, I don’t believe US stocks are in a bubble. I do, however, agree they’re looking pricey. That means investors need to tread carefully, and think a little harder about how they spread their exposures. Valuations for the US market are at the highest levels we’ve seen in some time. The widely used price/earnings (PE) ratio is 22.8, well above the average since 1990 of 16.6 and the 18.7 average of the last decade. The only time it’s been higher was in the late 1990s, in the days that preceded the dotcom boom and bust. Things are eerily similar today, with the market strength being driven largely by companies associated with AI trends. The big three – Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple – together make up more than one-fifth of the S&P 500. Last month Deutsche Bank produced a fascinating chart to really put this into perspective. It showed how Nvidia’s market value had surpassed the total value of every country in the world’s entire listed stock exchange apart from the US, China, Japan and India. Let that sink in. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany. The US market is more concentrated than we’ve seen in decades and while that’s a risk, it also makes those PE comparisons less useful. The tech behemoths of 2025 have increasingly dominant positions, high margins and very profitable business models. Can you really compare them with the biggest companies of 20 years ago? In 2005 Exxon Mobil was the largest stock on the market, while Citigroup, General Electric and Walmart were in the top five. The earnings power of this class of 2025 is hugely exciting, if you’re a believer in the productivity growth potential of AI. It can’t be overstated how important this is, because it’s earnings growth that ultimately drives share prices (at least in the longer term). Earnings for the US tech sector grew 23% in the June quarter, relative to a year ago. The communication services sector (where the likes of Meta and Alphabet reside) saw an even larger gain of 46%. Looking ahead to 2026, analysts are projecting earnings growth for the S&P 500 index of almost 14%, double the long-term average of about 7%. The so-called Magnificent 7 are expected to contribute as much as two-thirds of this. Even if the earnings tailwinds can justify the higher valuations and keep pushing the US market higher, there’s a strong case for diversification right now. Other sharemarkets look more reasonable when we compare current valuations to long-term averages. The UK and Europe are trading in line with history, emerging market shares are only slightly higher, while Japan looks cheaper. Even within the US itself, there are sectors which have lagged and look better value. Healthcare, energy and real estate are trading in line with their longer-term average PE, while utilities and consumer staples are only at a modest premium. Each of those regions and sectors will be facing its own unique backdrop, and valuation alone isn’t an indicator of where prices will go in the next year or two. However, for investors feeling uneasy about the ongoing strength of American equities, there are plenty of ways to hedge your bets. Valuations across the US sharemarket are indeed high, but it could keep performing well if the economy remains resilient, the Fed keeps reducing interest rates and the tech sector keeps delivering solid earnings. At the same time, it would be unwise to ignore the risk things are a little overdone. The astute investor is probably ensuring they have an exposure to markets outside the US, while maintaining a healthy foothold in the world’s biggest economy.

Title: Why International Stocks Are Surging And What US Investors Should Know

ByBill Stone, Contributor. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so. – Warren Buffett After several years of underperformance, international stocks are outperforming the US, igniting a discussion about whether investors should increase their exposure to foreign stocks. A broad measure of international stock performance is the MSCI ACWI, excluding the US, which has a total return of 26.7% year-to-date through the third quarter. The MSCI ACWI index includes both developed and emerging markets. In comparison, the US’s S&P 500 has risen 14.8%. The MSCI EAFE is a subset of developed international markets, while the MSCI EM covers the stock markets of emerging countries. While past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future returns, investors in international stocks have been quite disappointed relative to US-centric investors over the past five, ten, and twenty years. Over the past twenty years, the S&P 500 has achieved a total return of 700.6%, significantly outperforming the 233.3% return from broad international markets. More about this later, but one of the major drivers for US stocks was the tremendous performance of the US technology sector, which soared by 2,053.8% over the last twenty years. An additional variable for US-based investors owning international stocks is the impact of foreign currencies. US investors experience higher returns from their international holdings when the US dollar depreciates relative to the foreign currency of the international stocks they own. Given the weakness of the US dollar relative to many currencies this year, this has juiced the returns of foreign stocks. In fact, the year-to-date move in currencies provided 9.3 percentage points of the 11.9 percentage points of outperformance of the MSCI ACWI Ex-US over the S&P 500. The year-to-date boost to international investments is unlikely to be repeated if history is any guide. In fact, foreign exchange has reduced the returns of US-based investors in foreign stocks over the past twenty years. Even the emerging market stock index that benefited the most from currency tailwinds only gained 68.7% over twenty years, due to foreign currency exposure, which equates to a 3% annualized gain resulting from currency translation. Despite the currency help, the S&P 500 outpaced emerging markets stocks by a wide margin. While some might extoll the virtues of currency diversification, most US investors have their liabilities almost exclusively in US dollars. Thus, an extensive currency mismatch between assets and liabilities should be viewed as a risk, not a positive attribute. Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing. – Warren Buffett Many academics and some practitioners argue that US investors suffer from a home country bias, as they do not own a sufficient number of international stocks to aid in diversification. They consider a market capitalization-weighted allocation to be a proper baseline, which suggests that US stocks should comprise 49% of a stock portfolio, according to their calculations. Beyond ignoring the foreign exchange risk, this argument overlooks the reality that the US occupies a privileged position relative to most countries. The US benefits from an embrace of capitalism and the rule of law. Furthermore, our markets are already fully diversified across sectors, which is not the case for all countries. Because many of our US companies are global leaders and competitors, over 40% of the revenues for the S&P 500 are sourced internationally, allowing investors to gain international exposure by holding large-cap US stocks. Another lens to consider is that an allocation to international indexes is a bet against technology. The S&P 500 is 35% technology, while the foreign markets' tech weighting is 14%. Instead, the international markets have a significantly higher exposure to financial companies and banks than the US. It is fair to argue that focusing solely on the technology sector overlooks the actual impact of technology leaders in the US. Adding Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to the mix increases the technology-related US exposure to 46%. The US is fortunate to be home to many of the world's leading technology companies. While it can be debated whether technology is where you want to be overweight at the moment, those considering international index investing should be aware of the inherent wager in making that move. Another argument used by some advocates for international investing is that valuations are cheaper than in the US. The forward estimated price-to-earnings ratio is 14.7 times for international stocks versus the US's 22.1 times. While the valuation is lower, US stocks should trade at a higher valuation due to a superior return on equity, which measures the earnings that a company produces from the capital provided by shareholders. US companies also have superior profit margins, which is the percentage of revenue that ends up as bottom-line profits. The US technology sector is a crucial reason why the S&P 500 boasts exceptional profitability. There can be reasonable disagreements about the size of the valuation premium appropriate for US stocks. Still, the mere fact that international stocks as a whole are cheaper is necessary but not sufficient to argue for sustained outperformance from them. The five very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. – Warren Buffett referring to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in the Japanese trading companies. Although the US has a large share, there are well-managed and dominant companies domiciled outside the country. Rather than a predetermined percentage allocation of a stock portfolio with international stocks, investors should seek specific opportunities worldwide, while being mindful of the additional risks associated with foreign currencies and particular locales. Even though he primarily invests in US securities, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) can provide a good example. Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. In Buffett's 2024 annual letter, he noted that all five companies had agreed to relax the previously agreed-upon 10% ownership ceiling. At the recent annual meeting, Buffett said he "won't give a thought" to selling them and expects Berkshire to own them for fifty years or more. Berkshire now owns around 10% of each of these trading companies. Interestingly, Buffett mitigated the foreign exchange risk associated with these companies being traded in Japanese Yen by having Berkshire Hathaway issue Yen-denominated bonds, thereby better currency-matching assets and liabilities. While individual investors can't issue foreign-currency-denominated bonds, currency-hedged investments are available to mitigate currency risk. For example, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (DXJ) provides exposure to dividend-paying Japanese stocks, currently including most of Buffett's Japanese trading houses, while hedging the currency to remove as much of the Yen-currency risk as possible. Alternatively, a non-currency-hedged individual foreign stock position can be perfectly reasonable if it presents an attractive opportunity, even when considering the currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks of the country.

I am a long-time shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

UPDATED 23:51 EDT / OCTOBER 10 2025 by Mark Albertson A major shift in U.S. government sentiment toward cryptocurrencies combined with innovation from AI are making the stablecoin market an emerging force in the digital asset economy. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that crypto is having its “ChatGPT moment” and stablecoins are leading some of the largest companies in the world into programmable finance. Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., X Corp., Airbnb Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Google LLC and Uber Technologies Inc. are all reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins on their platforms. Ten major banks, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, are also investigating whether to issue stablecoins as part of their offerings. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currency, often the U.S. dollar. “It seems like everyone is launching a stablecoin,” said Amy Kalnoki, co-founder and chief operating officer of Bitwave Inc. “Investing in digital assets has gone mainstream. It’s no longer a question of whether enterprises will adopt digital assets, but when.” Kalnoki spoke Thursday at the BuildETH Conference in San Francisco, a gathering of leaders in the Ethereum decentralized blockchain community. She noted that stablecoin transfer volume now exceeds that of global credit issuers Visa and Mastercard, reaching $27 trillion last year. A major reason for the tailwind behind stablecoins is the emergence of a U.S. law establishing the first comprehensive regulatory framework for the fledgling currency. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was signed by President Donald Trump in July and reduced regulatory uncertainty for financial institutions, issuers and investors. The GENIUS Act, coupled with a “Project Crypto” initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize rules and regulations that will enable crypto trading, have infused real financial power in the issuance and settlement of digital currencies, according to Gary Yang, founding partner at Eureka Finance. “The GENIUS Act and Project Crypto are redefining the rules of the financial game,” Yang told the BuildETH audience. “If everyone can print money, then you have to build up the pricing power of your money. This is what the GENIUS Act is doing.” Missing from this recent wave of regulatory permissiveness is the answer to a key question: How will consumers be able to use stablecoins as a ubiquitous currency if they are dependent on each issuer’s platform? This question of interoperability has not been resolved by the U.S. government, and it’s a prime topic of interest to those in the crypto world today. Amy Kolnaki of Bitwave described the growth of stablecoin adoption. “The key question is will stablecoins be interoperable or will they be siloed?” Kalnoki noted. “It is a really interesting time of how fractioned things are right now. It’s an interesting time to see who will win the stablecoin race.” The influence of AI in the crypto industry may push digital currency providers to build interoperable models for stablecoins. This is currently playing out as major players grapple with implementing a consistent payments standard, potentially using the x402 open protocol that has existed on the internet for decades. The x402 protocol is a “payment required” status code that sits on top of HTTP. Last month, Cloudflare Inc. and Coinbase Inc. launched the x402 Foundation to further the development of an open internet standard for payments. There is some urgency behind this initiative, as enterprises continue to adopt and implement AI agents. It’s expected that agents ultimately will shop, make buying decisions and execute payments on behalf of users. The x402 standard, along with the Agents Payment Protocol or AP2 under development by Google, provide early looks at how AI will automate consumer purchases. Kevin Leffew of Coinbase highlighted enterprise interest in the x402 standard. “The goal for x402 is to be something analogous to Kubernetes,” Kevin Leffew, go-to-market lead for the Coinbase Developer Platform, told the BuildETH gathering. “It’s driving value across platforms.” For the x402 standard to succeed as the agentic payment protocol, it has to be fast. This is not a simple problem to solve inside the crypto world which was built on the often-cumbersome application of per transaction settlement fees called “gas.” At the software company Edge & Node, developers are working on an enhancement for x402 that will allow for deferred payment schemes via signed vouchers that reduce gas costs and settle micropayments on-chain. The company previously built the Graph infrastructure for indexing on-chain data and views the agent payment protocol as a significant next step. “Trillions of dollars will flow agent to agent,” according to Edge & Node CEO Rodrigo Coelho. “We’ve got to surf this wave rather than being inundated by it.” The current momentum behind stablecoins and the crypto world has also brought renewed scrutiny on the industry’s privacy and security. If the floodgates open for agentic payments in decentralized finance, there is also a risk that users will end up disclosing far more than they bargained for. The blockchain uses a “mempool,” a public queue of unconfirmed transactions waiting in line for addition to the next available block. Malicious actors can exploit this process, known as a MEV or Maximal Extractable Value exploit, by remining blocks for theft or leveraging the visibility and force victims to sell at a lower price. Losses in this category are beginning to pile up. There have been reports that Coinbase lost $300,000 to MEV bots in August, and one user was victimized by a MEV exploit for $1 million in stablecoin last month. SKALE Labs Inc. has developed a BITE Protocol designed to encrypt blockchain transaction details before they are sent to the chain. It’s what co-founder and CEO Jack O’Holleran called passing the “Barista Test.” You want to buy coffee from your friendly barista, but you don’t want to expose all of your financial details in the process. “There’s so much innovation happening, but at some point you’ve got to deliver and reach the masses,” O’Holleran explained. “You are going to have a lot of robot baristas. We need to live in a world where you can buy things with stablecoins and not expose what you own.” Social engineering attacks and inadvertent disclosure of private keys have also exposed new vulnerabilities in the crypto world. That was reinforced in February when alleged hackers from North Korea stole $1.5 billion from an Ethereum wallet controlled by Bybit Technology Ltd., an exploit believed to be the largest cryptocurrency heist to date. Yevheniia Broshevan of Hacken outlined security risks confronting the crypto world. “Getting access to private keys is something we keep seeing over and over,” said Yevheniia Broshevan, co-founder and CEO of Hacken. “Be really cautious what you are clicking and who it is coming from.” Despite setbacks and ongoing risk in the cryptocurrency market, enthusiasm for stablecoins and mainstream growth in decentralized finance continues to grow. The optimism is fueled by a desire to become a force in “forex” or the foreign exchange market, which has a daily trading volume of $9.6 trillion and a total value range of $3.4 quadrillion to $3.9 quadrillion. By any measure, that’s real money. “The foreign exchange market is ultimately the only market these stablecoins are going after,” said Matthew Chruscielski, ecosystem lead at ZetaChain Inc. “Who wouldn’t want to be a part of $3.9 quadrillion?” Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Here’s How High The XRP Price Would Be With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Among all the cryptocurrencies in the industry, few have seen as many comments and predictions as XRP. Once trapped under legal uncertainty, XRP has begun to reclaim attention thanks to favorable legal developments and the anticipated launch of Spot XRP ETFs. However, XRP’s current valuation is significantly below that of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But what if XRP were to rise to the same market capitalization as Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf offers a glimpse into how much each XRP token would be worth if it reached Bitcoin’s current market cap. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached heights that rival and even surpass some of the world’s largest multinational corporations. Notably, Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.415 trillion places it shoulder to shoulder with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the eighth-biggest asset by market cap, just behind Silver and Amazon, and well ahead of Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Saudi Aramco. XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but its market cap is far below Bitcoin’s lead. However, many analysts and market commentators believe XRP stands out as one of the few assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. This belief originates from XRP’s alignment with traditional finance. Its established partnerships with banks and payment providers give it a practical use case that most cryptocurrencies do not have. At the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $168 billion, not even up to one-tenth of Bitcoin’s market cap. According to MarketCapOf, if XRP were to reach Bitcoin’s current market cap, each token would be worth approximately $40.68. Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 53.4 billion tokens, this price prediction represents an increase of over 14,000% or 14.35x, from its current level of around $2.8. In practical terms, an early investor holding just 1,000 XRP today would see their holdings valued at more than $40,000 under this scenario. The comparison provides a valuable perspective on XRP’s long-term potential and the scale of value transfer possible within the crypto market. It also shows how far XRP needs to go in order to reach Bitcoin’s current level. Bitcoin’s dominance today is due to its first-mover advantage and its acceptance as a store of value. However, XRP is growing in remittances and real-world asset tokenization, and Ripple’s stakeholders are working to challenge SWIFT. This gives the cryptocurrency a utility foundation that could cause the growth of its market share. If Ripple continues to secure partnerships with central banks, payment providers, and institutional investors, as Ripple has increasingly done in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, then the idea of XRP closing even a fraction of the gap with Bitcoin becomes less far-fetched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83. Another factor that could contribute to this projected price growth is if Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US and they perform well.

Title: Ceasefire Working

Israel Liz Wolfe | 10.10.2025 9:30 AM Israeli troops retreating: The ceasefire came into effect at noon local time in Gaza, and Israeli forces stopped their advances, repositioning themselves according to the demarcated lines. Israel's cabinet convened and signed off on the deal early this morning, which starts the 72-hour clock for Hamas to release all hostages. Per the deal, 250 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails in exchange. The U.S. will reportedly send 200 troops to the Middle East—possibly not directly into Gaza, but adjacent to it—to monitor the ceasefire's implementation; soldiers from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates will also be involved in monitoring the situation. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Meanwhile, "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly implied for the first time that not all the deceased hostages held captive in Gaza will return," reports CNN. "In a televised address, Netanyahu said that Israel will work to locate all of the dead hostages in Gaza 'as soon as possible,' underscoring previous assessments that Hamas may not be able to find and return all of their remains." Twenty-eight hostages are believed to be dead, while 20 are still living; Netanyahu has long conditioned the ceasefire on the total return of all hostages. "We will bring the deceased hostages to burial in Israel," Netanyahu reminded the Israeli people. "We will work to locate all of them as soon as possible, and we will fulfill this as a sacred duty of mutual responsibility." Disarmament is still being negotiated, and there's still the disheartening possibility that further negotiations will be snarled. But so far, early news from the region is very promising. Letitia James indicted in mortgage fraud case: New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted by the Department of Justice, seemingly directed specifically to pursue this case by President Donald Trump, on charges that she committed one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution when buying a home in Norfolk, Virginia. "The indictment accuses Ms. James of violating a mortgage agreement on a Virginia house she purchased in 2020 by using it as a rental property," reports The New York Times, but James' lawyer says his client "flatly and forcefully denies these charges" and that the case is instead "driven by President Trump's desire for revenge." Some evidence has emerged that James did, in fact, receive favorable terms on her loan that let her save just under $20,000 over the full life of the loan. (It's not clear that James does rent the property out: Someone familiar with her situation told The New York Times that the property is just occupied by family members who have no lease.) You're not mistaken in thinking this is evocative of the civil fraud case James brought against Trump, and also of the accusations levied against Federal Reserve Board Chair Lisa Cook. This is the predictable outcome of lawfare: races to the bottom, to dig up as much dirt as possible on one's enemies, and to waste as much time and money as possible litigating it all instead of doing more valuable law-enforcement work. (This applies whether it's this case against James or her civil fraud case against Trump, to be clear.) Everything's TV: "A spooky convergence is happening in media," writes Derek Thompson on his Substack. "Everything that is not already television is turning into television." Nowadays, "only a small share of time spent on its social-networking platforms is truly 'social' networking—that is, time spent checking in with friends and family. More than 80 percent of time spent on Facebook and more than 90 percent of time spent on Instagram is spent watching videos, the company reported. Most of that time is spent watching content from creators whom the user does not know." Ditto for podcasts—formerly basically radio—shifting to YouTube; everything's TV now. Same with Sora and Vibes, new artificial intelligence tools from OpenAI and Meta, respectively; everything's TV. So why is this a problem? TV isn't inherently bad, per se. "Television speaks to us in a particular dialect, [Neil] Postman argued," continues Thompson. "When everything turns into television, every form of communication starts to adopt television's values: immediacy, emotion, spectacle, brevity." This extends to, and warps, our politics: "The right-wing president is a reality-TV star. The most exciting new voice on the left is a straight-to-camera savant. Mastering the grammar of television—especially short-form television—does not feel secondary to political success in America; it is political success in America." Isn't this literally the world described in Harrison Bergeron? The TV always on, the mental-handicap radio zapping the father's head so he can't complete a thought. pic.twitter.com/W9HQS9cved — Liz Wolfe (@LizWolfeReason) October 10, 2025 I'll level with you: I don't like the great convergence, in which many forms of media become TV. I don't like the hit to our attention spans. I don't like people's inability to sit with their own thoughts. I don't like the fact that proportionality is lost when everything is portrayed as urgent and important. I don't like the algorithm-driven attempts to jockey for my attention via ALL-CAPS in headlines and obnoxiously expressive thumbnails and a constant stream of emotive language. And, mostly, I'm worried about what habits will be developed by generations who are raised on TV slop, whose attention spans are not safeguarded, and whose critical thinking skills were never given a chance to form.

Title: Is Oracle Or Palantir The Smarter AI Stock To Buy?

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle focuses mostly on database software, where it is a leader, and data centers. The company's potential stock upside may be higher.Palantir’s strategy is dispersed across more market segments, making its growth prospects much higher.Oracle may be the better bet given its superior risk return. Although risk-loving traders may try to ride the Palantir rollercoaster. OpenAI and Nvidia get most of the headlines around artificial intelligence, but there are many other company's stocks that investors could trade to profit from the AI boom. How so? Companies in the AI cloud services and AI-powered applications software sectors – along with providers of hardware and power for AI data centers – present compelling opportunities. For example, is AI cloud-services provider Oracle or AI-powered data analytics company Palantir a better investment? Oracle may be the better bet given its superior risk return. Although risk-loving traders may try to ride the Palantir rollercoaster. Read on for a comparison of the companies’ AI business strategies, growth trajectories, financials, valuation and investor sentiment. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s partnerships drive the company’s AI strategy. Although Oracle is the fifth largest global provider of cloud infrastructure, with about 4% share, OCI is growing faster than its larger rivals, such as AWS (31% market share), Microsoft Azure (22%) and Google Cloud (12%). OCI’s growth has benefited from Oracle’s partnerships with leading AI chatbot providers and the chipmaker Nvidia. Partnerships include OpenAI, xAI (Elon Musk's AI company), and Meta, according to Oracle’s most recent earnings call transcript. Oracle also benefited from its rivals’ use of its database software. For instance, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use Oracle’s multi-cloud database – yielding 1,529% growth in the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 report by deploying “34 cloud regions inside competitor platforms,” Oracle founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said in a company release. Palantir operates in various market segments, including data analytics, AI platforms and mission-critical decision systems. The company enjoys a competitive advantage from decades selling to the U.S. government, and Palantir’s success launching AI platforms quickly and effectively. For instance, Palantir has spent more than 20 years working with the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Army. Moreover, the company’s rapid deployment of its AIP — fewer than “two months from bootcamp to production,” according to Futurum Group — has helped Palantir win new contracts. Palantir’s value for customers is reflected in the company’s 128% net-dollar retention rate, indicating strong upselling to existing customers, according to Yahoo! Finance. Customer success stories“include "Cleveland Clinic reducing ER wait times by 38 minutes and Tampa General Hospital shortening sepsis patient stays by 15%,” according to a Palantir investor update. Oracle’s business strategy, financial performance and prospects, and the stock's upside differ significantly from Palantir’s. Oracle focuses mostly on database software – where it is a clear leader – and data centers, and the company's potential stock upside may be higher. Palantir’s strategy is dispersed across more market segments, making its growth prospects much higher. However, Palantir’s stock risks falling: The company has a very high valuation and growth is expected to slowdown. Oracle supplies products mostly for enterprises, while Palantir’s services are more specialized and mostly aimed at governments. Oracle’s services included OCI, enterprise applications — enterprise resource management, human capital management and customer relationship management — as well as database services. Oracle sells to companies of all sizes in many vertical markets and works extensively with partners and other resellers. Palantir supplies more specialized services, including data integration, analytics and an AI platform. While it's expanding its commercial footprint, Palantir has mostly worked with governments, which accounted for more than half the company’s revenue last year. Oracle is growing more slowly, has greater potential for revenue acceleration and has been more consistently profitable. Palantir is growing faster, could suffer a slowdown and first became profitable as recently as the fourth quarter of 2022, Reuters reported. Oracle’s growth rate has accelerated in the last four quarters. The company’s OCI unit grew faster than rival cloud services providers, and the company has a significant backlog. For example, Oracle’s revenue growth increased from 7% to 12% between the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of FY 2026, when the company earned a 19.6% net margin. In first-quarter 2026, OCI revenue increased about 53% – faster than AWS (18%) and Microsoft Azure (about 24%). Most impressively, Oracle’s Remaining Performance Obligations backlog in September 2025 soared 359% to $455 billion, as I wrote last month on Forbes. Palantir grew faster, however analysts expect the company’s growth to decelerate below management’s projections. Between Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, Palantir’s revenue growth went from 27% to 48%. In the most recent quarter, Palantir’s net margin was 32.5%, up from 24% in the first quarter of 2025. However, Palantir’s growth appears to be slowing down. Management projects 45% growth for 2025, according to a company release, although analysts forecast growth moderating to between 25% and 45% in 2026, Simply Wall Street reported. Palantir has a higher valuation than Oracle and analysts see greater downside risk to holding Palantir stock. Oracle trades at a price-to-sales ratio which is roughly equal to the enterprise software industry average of 8 to 12. Given Oracle’s significant revenue backlog in its OCI unit, the company's valuation could be considered low, TradingView noted. Palantir’s price-to-sales ratio was 127 on Oct. 6 – nearly seven times more than rival Snowflake’s P/S ratio of 19. Both Oracle and Palantir face significant risks. Oracle’s worries include large capital expenditures to supply OCI demand and intense rivalry. Palantir’s high valuation would mean any execution failure could sink its stock. While Wall Street maintains 74% "Buy" ratings on Oracle because of its high valuation, analysts are more skeptical of Palantir despite its superior operational performance. Consensus ratings on Palantir show "Hold" with between 60% and 65% of analysts neutral, according to TipRanks. Palantir stock is 9% overvalued according to TipRanks, which sets an average price target of $165. Oracle’s price target of $341 suggests the stock has 19% upside. If you have a big appetite for risk, go with Palantir. If you are looking for relatively predictable growth at a reasonable price, consider buying Oracle stock. Analysts have more confidence in Oracle’s upside because it has a more reasonable valuation and a large backlog of future OCI orders. By contrast, analysts see growth slowing for Palantir, making its eye-popping valuation hard to justify. Of course, if Palantir keeps beating and raising, the stock will pop.

Title: Tesla package pays Musk billions even if he misses goals

When Tesla's board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of "Mars-shot milestones" to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. The board's proposal said Musk would have to "completely transform Tesla and society as we know it" in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get "zero" unless he meets those "incredibly ambitious" goals. Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving. He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board's easier goals that will not necessarily revolutionise Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found. Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple's Tim Cook, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar. Musk's vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That is a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024. Tesla earlier this week unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales. Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: "The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met." The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven and a half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them. Musk said last month on his social media platform X that the package is "not about 'compensation' but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots." In its proposal, the board said Musk is "motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation." Self driving cars, robotaxis and robotics Each goal grants Musk 1% of Tesla stock if he also reaches valuation milestones between $2 trillion and $8.5 trillion. One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) software, which can’t currently drive itself without human intervention. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said yesterday it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes. Musk's performance goal contains no requirement that Tesla make FSD fully autonomous, instead requiring only an "advanced driving system". That is a "made-up term" with no industry-standard definition, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specialising in autonomous driving. Autonomous-driving experts say the subscription target might be easily met by dropping the price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month. Tesla's leading electric-vehicle rival, China’s BYD, already offers a similar system for free. "If I were Musk’s personal employment lawyer, I would like these definitions," said Matthew Wansley, a professor at New York’s Cardozo School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. Another goal requires one million robotaxis in commercial operation and specifies cars "without a human driver in the vehicle." That is a potentially more restrictive definition but four autonomous-vehicle experts said it could be interpreted to allow for humans controlling vehicles remotely or from the passenger seat - as Tesla does now in its first small-scale robotaxi test in Austin, Texas. Musk's employment deal also sets a target of one million robots, an apparent reference to the Optimus humanoid robots Musk has long promised. But the goal does not specify "humanoid" and could be interpreted broadly, two robotics-industry experts said. It defines "bot" as "any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence." "It’s a totally vague formulation," said Christian Rokseth, an analyst with market research firm Humanoid.guide specialising in robotics and artificial intelligence. Investors, he said, are expecting a humanoid robot. Modest targets worth billions Hitting any two product goals in a decade, along with a $2.5 trillion valuation, pays Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Hitting three targets and a $3 trillion valuation pays him $54.6 billion. That means Musk could earn these amounts without delivering driverless Teslas, the signature product he has promised for a decade. Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, said that despite the loose language in his performance agreement, investors would ultimately hold him accountable for delivering transformational products. "If people start smelling there's something goofy here, he's in trouble," Munster said. In its pay proposal, Tesla's board declared Musk the only person capable of transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut. The board added that Musk, during negotiations, raised the prospect of "prioritising other ventures" if he and the board could not agree on compensation. Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a huge risk by so explicitly staking its future on one leader. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said Tesla's board has granted Musk a "monopoly" on its top job. Good corporate governance, she said, requires embracing a "competitive and fluid market for CEOs." The hard part - profits Musk's hardest performance targets are likely those involving profit, a measure with no room for interpretation. The directors set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared to Tesla's 2024 earnings of $16.6 billion. Tesla's EV business, which accounts for almost all its revenue, is deteriorating with aging models facing fierce competition. Its only newer model, the Cybertruck, has flopped. The way Musk's compensation is structured, however, allows for massive payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal combined with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock payout. So Musk gets the same pay for meeting the relatively easy vehicle sales and FSD-subscription goals, for instance, as he would for boosting earnings five-fold to $80 billion. The board's valuation goals may prove far easier than its profit targets. Tesla's value could hit $2 trillion, for instance, if shares grow a modest 6.4% annually over the decade following the board's September 3 pay-package approval. That is slower growth than the S&P 500’s 8.5% annual average over the past 30 years and less than half the Nasdaq’s 13.2% average. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Tesla, said its valuation could easily hit $3 trillion or more over a decade with market-average performance. He pointed out, however, that Tesla's value is already largely based on "future products that don’t exist today." For Musk to claim the biggest payouts offered by Tesla’s board, Goldstein said, "we’re going to start having to see real products." Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and an expert witness for Tesla in defending Musk’s 2018 pay package, acknowledged that the vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation goals are not "much of a stretch" but simply reaching those will not appease shareholders. Neither will the "handful of billions" for lower-rung goals matter much to Musk, who cares more about historic technological achievements, Murphy said. Shareholders, he said, have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk - and only Musk - can hit them. "Is it worth it?" Murphy said. "Shareholders seem to think so."

Title: Time Bomb: How Uninsured Stablecoins and Crypto Derivatives Threaten Financial and Economic Stability

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser,what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, original reporting Yves here. In our post on the high odds of an eventual AI stock bubble collapse, we pointed out that debt or dollar distress could, as happened in 1987, set off a stock market unraveling. We were remiss in that post in not pointing out how runs on stablecoins and collapses in the value of stablecoin derivatives could in and of themselves trigger a crisis, or trigger a series of financial asset value plunges. This article helps remedy that lapse. By Arthur E. Wilmarth, Professor Emeritus of Law, George Washington University. Originally published at the Institute of New Economic Thinking website The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. On July 18, 2025, the President Trump signed into law the ‘‘Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” (GENIUS Act). The GENIUS Act – despite its Orwellian sobriquet – is a profoundly misguided lawthat creates enormous dangers for our financial system, economy, and society. The GENIUS Act authorizes nonbanks to issue uninsured stablecoins to the public without the essential safeguards provided by federal deposit insurance and the prudential regulations governing FDIC-insured banks. In addition, the GENIUS Act gives federal and state regulators broad authority to allow nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell highly-leveraged crypto derivatives and other speculative crypto investments to the public. As shown below, the GENIUS Act plants the seeds for a crypto-fueled “Subprime 2.0” financial crisis that could be even worse than the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The GENIUS Act places the federal government’s seal of approval on uninsured and weakly-regulated nonbank stablecoins as well as hazardous crypto derivatives. By doing so, the GENIUS Act has greatly increased the likelihood that future runs on stablecoins and fire sales of crypto derivativeswill trigger systemic crises in our financial markets that have devastating spillover effects on our economy. The GENIUS Act also opens the door for Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to issue and distribute stablecoins and conduct a crypto-based banking business. Allowing commercial and technology giants to offer stablecoins and other risky crypto investments will greatly increase the risk that future crypto crashes will engulf our entire economy. In view of the federal government’s massive debt burden and rapidly rising debt service costs, it is extremely doubtful whether federal agencies could arrange another set of comprehensive bailouts without triggering a sovereign debt crisis. To remove the intolerable threats posed by uninsured nonbank stablecoins and crypto derivatives, Congress should repeal the GENIUS Act and pass legislation requiring all issuers and distributors of stablecoins to be FDIC-insured banks. Congress should also pass legislation requiring crypto derivatives to comply with the prudential rules established by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for non-digital derivatives. Uninsured Nonbank Stablecoins Are Highly Vulnerable to Investor Runs, Which the GENIUS Act Will ot prevent A stablecoin is a crypto-asset whose issuer represents that the stablecoin’s value will maintain parity with a designated fiat currency or some other referenced asset or group of assets. About 98% of global stablecoins are linked (“pegged”) to the U.S. dollar. Dollar-linked stablecoins are functionally equivalent to bank deposits because their issuers represent that their stablecoins will be redeemed or transferred to third parties, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, on their holders’ demand or within a specified time. The global stablecoin market is highly concentrated. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC account for over 80% of the $300 billion market capitalization of all global stablecoins. Stablecoins are primarily used as payment instruments for speculating in crypto-assets with fluctuating values, with about 90% of stablecoin payments being linked to crypto trades. Stablecoins are also widely used for conducting illicit transactions. In 2023, stablecoins were used as payment instruments for 60% of unlawful cryptocurrency transactions (including crypto scams, ransomware, evasion of capital controls, money laundering, and tax evasion) and 80% of all cryptocurrency transactions conducted by sanctioned regimes and terrorist groups. Dollar-linked stablecoins are used to a limited extent for cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments, especially in developing countries with high inflation rates, unstable currencies, and unreliable banking and payment systems. In those countries, dollar-linked stablecoins provide a more stable form of currency, a more secure form of payment, and a hedge against inflation. At present, however, only 6% of stablecoin transactions involve cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments. In addition, some governments view dollar-linked stablecoins as a threat to their monetary sovereignty and are considering measures to ban or limit the use of dollar-linked stablecoins in their countries. Despite the promises made by stablecoin issuers, stablecoins have proven to be anything but stable. More than 20 stablecoins collapsed between 2016 and 2022, and every leading global stablecoin – including USDT and USDC – lost its “peg” on multiple occasions between 2019 and 2023. Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations. The global market value of outstanding stablecoins dropped from $180 billion to $130 billion during the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, when the price of Bitcoin and the total market capitalization of all crypto-assets dropped by 70%. When large numbers of investors are suddenly obliged to liquidate their stablecoins, they must rely on the ability of stablecoin issuers and stablecoin exchanges to redeem stablecoins quickly at the “pegged” value of $1 per coin. The GENIUS Act permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to hold all or most of their reserves in uninsured financial instruments, such as uninsured bank deposits, money market funds (MMFs), and repurchase agreements (repos). Those uninsured reserves make nonbank stablecoin issuers vulnerable to serious disruptions in traditional financial markets. When Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed during the regional banking crisis of 2023, SVB’s largest uninsured depositor turned out to be Circle, which held $3.3 billion (8%) of USDC’s reserves at SVB. USDC broke its $1 “peg” after SVB failed, and its value fell to $0.87. USDC’s stablecoin holders launched a major run, and Circle was forced to liquidate $8 billion of its assets to satisfy redemption demands. USDC avoided a complete collapse – which could have caused a systemic meltdown in crypto markets – only after federal regulators invoked the systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and bailed out Circle and SVB’s other uninsured depositors. The federal government’s rescue of Circle represented the first government bailout of uninsured nonbank stablecoins. As SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw observed in April 2005, “there is always a risk, particularly in times of market stress or if the price of a stablecoin drops, of a ‘run’ scenario” where crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers “cannot honor all redemption requests in real time,” triggering a “self-reinforcing cycle of redemptions and fire sales of reserve assets.” The runs that have already occurred on nonbank stablecoins resemble the runs on uninsured deposits, MMFs, repos, and other uninsured, short-term financial claims that have taken place during U.S. financial crises stretching from the nineteenth century through 2023. The federal government rescued uninsured depositors in 1980-92, 2008-09, and 2023 to prevent banking and financial crises from becoming full-blown economic depressions. For similar reasons, the federal government protected investors in MMFs and other uninsured short-term financial instruments (such as commercial paper and repos) during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the pandemic financial crisis of 2020-21. The foregoing crises demonstrate that uninsured nonbank stablecoins, like other uninsured, short-term financial claims, are highly vulnerable to investor runs whenever there are substantial doubts about the ability of obligors to repay those financial claims in a timely manner. The GENIUS Act ignores the lessons of history because (1) it establishes a very weak and woefully inadequate regulatory regime for stablecoins, (2) it fails to provide a federally-supervised insurance fund or a federally-authorized lender of last resort to ensure the timely repayment of stablecoins, and (3) its only mechanism for dealing with defaults by stablecoin issuers is a deeply flawed bankruptcy regime, which will encourage stablecoin holders to run at the first sign of trouble. The GENIUS Act Will Not Improve Our Payments System or Increase Financial Inclusion Crypto advocates claim that uninsured nonbank stablecoins will greatly improve the U.S. payments system and increase financial inclusion. In fact, nonbank stablecoins operating on permissionless public blockchains do not offer a viable technology for providing fast, reliable, and cost-effective general-purpose payments or other large-volume financial services. Permissionless public blockchains suffer from two major problems – lack of scalability (the inability to process large numbers of transactions quickly) and immutability (the inability to correct mistaken, fraudulent, and unauthorized transactions). Those two problems – which arise out of the basic tenets of public blockchains – prevent public blockchains from providing a feasible technology for high-volume financial services. To mitigate the scalability problem, public blockchains have used “Layer 2” strategies such as sidechains and off-chain processing. “Layer 2” strategies delegate responsibility for processing and validating transactions to designated groups, which transmit the results of their work to the public blockchain. Such delegations of responsibility to trusted parties cause public blockchains to resemble permissioned distributed ledgers, which are administered by banks, broker-dealers, clearing facilities, and other traditional financial institutions. When public blockchains change their operations to function like permissioned ledgers, they effectively become financial intermediaries, and there is no longer any possible justification for regulating them differently from traditional financial intermediaries. As SEC Commissioner Crenshaw pointed out in January 2024, “If [public blockchain] technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?” In addition to their unsuitability for general-purpose payments, nonbank stablecoins have not shown any ability to increase financial inclusion. Stablecoin holders must open bank accounts to convert their fiat currency into stablecoins, and to convert their stablecoins back into fiat currency. Stablecoin holders must also have internet access and financial sophistication, which many “unbanked” households lack. The crypto industry’s past dealings with underserved communities have included widespread predatory practices, including fraudulent marketing of high-risk crypto-assetsand “crypto ATMs” that charge high fees and are widely used to promote crypto scams. If Congress truly wants to promote a faster, cheaper, and more inclusive payments system, Congress should pass legislation that would (i) support tokenization of deposits on permissioned distributed ledgers administered by FDIC-insured banks, (ii) encourage faster implementation of real-time settlement services for bank payments, and (iii) require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility. Such legislation would promote much-needed improvements in our payments system and increase financial inclusion without undermining the integrity and effectiveness of our federally-insured banking system. The GENIUS Act Creates a “Shadow Banking 2.0” Crypto Regime and Unleashes Crypto Derivatives That Will Inflate a “Subprime 2.0” Crypto Bubble. The GENIUS Act allows uninsured nonbank stablecoins to become a dangerous new form of “shadow deposits” comparable to MMFs, thereby creating a dangerous “Shadow Banking 2.0” crypto regime. Nonbank stablecoin issuers will siphon away large amounts of deposits from FDIC-insured banks because the GENIUS Act permits affiliates of stablecoin issuers and crypto exchanges to pay “rewards” on stablecoins. The loss of bank deposits will severely impair the ability of community and regional banks to provide much-needed loans to consumers and Main Street businesses. Nonbank stablecoin issuers cannot replace those lost loans because they must invest virtually all their assets in designated short-term financial instruments held as reserves. The GENIUS Act also permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell to the public a potentially unlimited range of crypto derivatives and other crypto investments that are approved by federal and state regulators as being “incidental” to the activities of crypto asset service providers. Crypto derivatives – including futures, options, and swaps – account for about three-quarters of all crypto trading activity, and most crypto derivatives trades occur on unregulated foreign exchanges. Perpetual crypto futures contracts enable investors to make highly-leveraged, long-term bets on movements in crypto prices without owning the underlying crypto-assets. In addition, SEC has approved crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the value of both individual and multiple crypto-assets. Crypto ETFs are rapidly proliferating, as are “crypto treasury companies” that invest in crypto-assets. The explosion of high-risk crypto derivatives and other risky crypto investments is inflating a “Subprime 2.0” crypto bubble by generating multiple, highly-leveraged bets on extremely volatile crypto-assets that do not have any underlying tangible assets or independent cash flows. The rapidly growing pile of speculative bets on crypto-assets resembles the toxic pyramid of bets on subprime mortgages, which financial giants created during the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom of the 2000s by issuing trillions of dollars of derivatives whose values depended on the performance of subprime mortgages. The collapse of the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom in 2007 unleashed a global financial crisis. The bursting of the speculative crypto bubble produced by “Shadow Banking 2.0” and “Subprime 2.0” will almost certainly cause a similar crash, with potentially devastating spillover effects on our financial system and economy. Federal agencies will be very hard-pressed to contain such a crash with bailouts comparable to those of 2008-09 and 2020-21. Given the federal government’s huge debt burden, implementing such bailouts would be likely to trigger a crisis in the Treasury bond market as well as a significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The GENIUS Act Opens the Door for Big Tech firms and Other Commercial Enterprises to Conduct a Crypto Banking Business, Magnifying the Risks of the Current Crypto Bubble Under the GENIUS Act, Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises can acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers and use those issuers’ funds and services to establish crypto-based financial empires. Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Walmart, and X are already developing plans to offer stablecoins. The GENIUS Act allows privately-held technology firms, like Elon Musk’s X, to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The statute also permits the “Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,” chaired by Treasury Secretary Bessent, to authorize publicly-traded Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The GENIUS Act undermines our nation’s long-established policy of separating banking and commerce and creates enormous risks for consumers and Main Street businesses. Allowing Big Tech firms to issue and distribute stablecoins will give technology giants access to their customers’ private financial data, including detailed information about their financial assets and spending patterns. That access will increase exponentially the ability of Big Tech firms to surveil, sell, and monetize their customers’ private information. Acquisitions of stablecoin issuers by Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises will create a new category of “too-big-to-fail” financial giants. Those acquisitions will also greatly increase the likelihood that future crypto crashes will spread across the entire span of our economy, inflicting catastrophic losses on our financial system, economy, and society. Conclusion The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Why make those FDIC insured, but not Money Market Funds? MMF are securities like mutual funds and are protected to some degree by the SIPC. “To some degree”…I know They brought up the all important FDIC for this BS. Why not FDIC insurance for money market funds, which are often offered by FDIC insured banks? The article isn’t asking for stablecoin and crypto to be protected by SIPC “to some degree” or something like SIPC. Why would they get the special FDIC treatment and not money market funds? Did you miss that money market funds ARE now insured up to $250,000 like bank deposits? I didn’t see that dollar amount in the article. It mentioned some times of not letting MMFs go bust, but didn’t specify that it was an FDIC gaurantee. Please be careful of the terminology: Money Market Deposit Accounts are insured to the usual FDIC levels, when offered through a bank – the MMDA just another deposit account. A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules — depending on how it’s held, it would be insured against failure of the broker-dealer by SIPC insurance. The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins, and rightly points out the history lessons that are being ignored. I haven’t seen anything that implies that the FDIC is going to expand deposit insurance to stablecoin amounts held in a bank account. (Though bailouts of uninsured holdings at banks as a result of bank failure certainly seems to be the historical norm.) https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq ” A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules —” “The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins” The article is proposing legislation be passed which “requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks.” It’s not saying a subsidiary…as you say about money market funds. I never said they were FDIC insured. The 2008 program that insured them up to $250,000 was a Treasury program, not FDIC: https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Money-market-fund-insurance-program-no-longer-in-11603673.php And that amount was chosen because it was the same amount as FDIC insurance. The discussion is whether stablecoins would be bailed out in a crisis. I loathe the idea but the precedent says they would be. Not that I am encouraging readers to bet on it, but given how freaked out the officialdom is about runs on banks and large shadow banks (and mutual funds have been demonstrated to be in that category), the odds favor a second bailout if anything were to go awry. In fact, it would be politically hard not to do so after the Silicon Valley Bank rescue of uninsured depositors. Another note re FDIC insurance: it isn’t operative in the case of fraud. See here for an example: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/5-charged-with-80m-trust-theft/ Connecting to this question, I understand that imposing regulations upon stablecoin operators similar to those applying on banks (including reserves, prudential management, etc) would help reduce the risk and quash many of the worst and riskiest practices, but (perhaps a stupid question) why on its own would a FDIC insurance prevent runs on stablecoins? Isn’t FDIC insurance capped? And by the way: “require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility.” Oh no, again a proposal that requires proving that one meets the “minimum qualifications”. What about a low-cost “Bank On” deposit account with payment services for everybody, no qualifications asked, no bureaucratic applications, no availability depending from one year to another on the vagaries of life? It’s supposed to be capped, but look what happened with the SVB and other bailouts a couple of years ago. If SICP “to some degree” or something like that is good enough for other risky assets, why isn’t that brought up as an option? FDIC protect crypto and not money market funds? There’s a reason I assume for not doing it for money market funds. But that is being skipped over in the request to do it for crypto. “Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations…” And why not make stock portfolios FDIC insured? FDIC was brought up specifically. The FDIC inspects bank portfolios and can assure compliance with regs, specifically having full backing of the stablecoins. They are also talking about having losses covered. Or are they not? I would rather have them outlawed but that horse has left the barn and is in the next county. We are now forced to look at what options are least bad. Losses for a stablecoin would be the same as “breaking the buck” in a money market fund, as in would imply the failure/insolvency of the fund. I agree with most of the points except classifying all crypto assets as risky. Spot crypto ETFs that actually hold the underlying asset without use of risky futures and other derivatives are relatively safe. So is holding a deflationary asset like Bitcoin, the digital equivalent of gold. It derives its value from the network of participants, much like gold. There’s no inherent industrial or practical use for it other than all participants agreeing to use it as a store of value. BlackRock does not describe its Bitcoin ETF as a spot EFT on its site as in as part of its official disclosures. So I am not sure your claims about “spot EFT” are as encompassing as you imply: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust The language merely says “get exposure” which is way short of proportional to any underlying coins held. All ETFs also show drift from NAV since they trade on market prices and not on NAV like mutual funds. It’s a 100% spot ETF. Their holdings are all BTC (804,308.99780) worth $97,491,540,311.23 with some negligible amounts of cash in USD, as of 9 Oct 2025. It’s shown under “Holdings” in the link you mentioned. 🚀 Your response is beside the point. That is not what its investor disclosures say. I see no evidence in the marketing materials that BlackRock is contractually obligated to operate this EFT as a “spot” ETF nor do they call it a spot ETF in their marketing materials. If that is correct (and you would expect BlackRock to say prominently if they were running the ETF as a “spot” ETF, it would be an important selling point) that means they can change how they run it any time they damned well please. You are encouraged to find the sections of the fund prospectus that prove me wrong. but I see nothing of the kind on a quick pass of major terms. The entire “stablecoin” (which, with apologies to Voltaire, are neither stable nor coins) industry reminds of little more than 19th century “wildcat banking” with some sparkly “tech” sprinkled on top to gull the rubes. So it goes … Various players are getting a pass for this nonsense (see pic below)…so these types will continue to create messes that others have to clean up: “more and more like home mortgage securitization at the peak of the housing bubble with its overlapping series of capital conveyor belts.” pic.twitter.com/ar9NiVUaXp I don’t see it as all that far-fetched that we could have a AI/stock market collapse in combination with a crypto and stable coin panic. Poor Trump-ian impulse control on the trade and/or geopolitical front would then be the icing on the gravy, generating simultaneous and intertwined economic, financial and political crises… No wonder that gold, the ultimate Fear-O-Meter, is exploding in price. In the words of the immortal Lou Gorman: “The sun will rise, the sun will set, and I will have lunch.” In Water Cooler (remember that?) Lambert used to link to Greed and Fear index. I really don’t understand why that, and e.g., the VIX (also on that page) seem so unconcerned right now, apart from a spike earlier this year… Between inflation (Best foods mayo $12 Qt) and uncertainty I expect this Xmas to be a disaster for retailers, those 750,000 Federal workers who have just been told they might not get their back pay are unlikely to splurge on Xmas. Or spend $ on anything that isn’t a necessity. One of the things I learned selling Real Estate was that uncertainty killed markets, prices and interest rates had an important impact, however it was uncertainty that mattered most. And not by a small amount. Its pretty surreal watching it all play out-having no dog in the fight aside from the possibility that we’ll pull a circa 1990 move by take your pick of South American countries that all thought by renaming their national currency, everything would be jake. That’s what is potentially going down, our national currency backed by bright and shiny new bupkis. Don’t the Silicon Valley crypto-bros have as their goal the functional abolition of the national currency ( dollar) altogether, and the replacement of the dollar with their own stable of crypto currencies? Don’t they want to destroy the dollar’s value ( and retro-steal the value of every dollar saved right up to destruction day-zero) the same way the Yeltsin team destroyed all the “old rubles” to retro-steal all the paid-for work which earned those rubles by vaporising the value of all those saved ” old rubles”? Or is my simple layman’s mind playing memory tricks on me? It seems to me I remember millions of old pensioners in Yeltsin-era Russia being wiped out by Clinton’s Yeltsin-evaporation of their “old rubles”. If my memory is correct, then my view that this is exactly why the Silicon crypto-bros are advancing their crypto plans might at least be given a caution-inducing thought or two.

Title: Musk’s Tesla package pays him billions even if he misses ‘Mars-shot’ goals

Full Content:
When Tesla’s board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals. Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving. He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found. Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar. Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024. On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales. Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: “The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.” The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them. Musk said last month on his social media platform X that the package is “not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.” In its proposal, the board said Musk is “motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation.” Each goal grants Musk 1% of Tesla stock if he also reaches valuation milestones between $2 trillion and $8.5 trillion. One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software, which can’t currently drive itself without human intervention. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes. Musk’s performance goal contains no requirement that Tesla make FSD fully autonomous, instead requiring only an “advanced driving system.” That’s a “made-up term” with no industry-standard definition, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specializing in autonomous driving. Autonomous-driving experts say the subscription target might be easily met by dropping the price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month. Tesla’s leading electric-vehicle rival, China’s BYD, already offers a similar system for free. “If I were Musk’s personal employment lawyer, I would like these definitions,” said Matthew Wansley, a professor at New York’s Cardozo School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. Another goal requires one million robotaxis in commercial operation and specifies cars “without a human driver in the vehicle.” That’s a potentially more restrictive definition but four autonomous-vehicle experts said it could be interpreted to allow for humans controlling vehicles remotely or from the passenger seat – as Tesla does now in its first small-scale robotaxi test in Austin, Texas. Musk’s employment deal also sets a target of one million robots, an apparent reference to the Optimus humanoid robots Musk has long promised. But the goal doesn’t specify “humanoid” and could be interpreted broadly, two robotics-industry experts said. It defines “bot” as “any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence.” “It’s a totally vague formulation,” said Christian Rokseth, an analyst with market research firm Humanoid.guide specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence. Investors, he said, are expecting a humanoid robot. Hitting any two product goals in a decade, along with a $2.5 trillion valuation, pays Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Hitting three targets and a $3 trillion valuation pays him $54.6 billion. That means Musk could earn these amounts without delivering driverless Teslas, the signature product he’s promised for a decade. Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, said that despite the loose language in his performance agreement, investors would ultimately hold him accountable for delivering transformational products. “If people start smelling there’s something goofy here, he’s in trouble,” Munster said. In its pay proposal, Tesla’s board declared Musk the only person capable of transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut. The board added that Musk, during negotiations, raised the prospect of “prioritizing other ventures” if he and the board couldn’t agree on compensation. Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a huge risk by so explicitly staking its future on one leader. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said Tesla’s board has granted Musk a “monopoly” on Tesla’s top job. Good corporate governance, she said, requires embracing a “competitive and fluid market for CEOs.” Musk’s hardest performance targets are likely those involving profit, a measure with no room for interpretation. The directors set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Tesla’s 2024 earnings of $16.6 billion. Tesla’s EV business, which accounts for almost all its revenue, is deteriorating with aging models facing fierce competition. Its only newer model, the Cybertruck, has flopped. The way Musk’s compensation is structured, however, allows for massive payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal combined with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock payout. So Musk gets the same pay for meeting the relatively easy vehicle sales and FSD-subscription goals, for instance, as he would for boosting earnings five-fold to $80 billion. The board’s valuation goals may prove far easier than its profit targets. Tesla’s value could hit $2 trillion, for instance, if shares grow a modest 6.4% annually over the decade following the board’s Sept. 3 pay-package approval. That’s slower growth than the S&P 500’s 8.5% annual average over the past 30 years and less than half the Nasdaq’s 13.2% average. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Tesla, said its valuation could easily hit $3 trillion or more over a decade with market-average performance. He pointed out, however, that Tesla’s value is already largely based on “future products that don’t exist today.” For Musk to claim the biggest payouts offered by Tesla’s board, Goldstein said, “we’re going to start having to see real products.” Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and an expert witness for Tesla in defending Musk’s 2018 pay package, acknowledged that the vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation goals aren’t “much of a stretch” but simply reaching those won’t appease shareholders. Neither will the “handful of billions” for lower-rung goals matter much to Musk, who cares more about historic technological achievements, Murphy said. Shareholders, he said, have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk – and only Musk – can hit them. “Is it worth it?” Murphy said. “Shareholders seem to think so.” The Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed the sale of green crackers in Delhi-NCR, but with certain conditions. The court said that offline sale of green crackers will be permitted from October 18 to October 21.

Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: PIXABAY Published Oct 10, 2025, 11:30 AM Updated Oct 10, 2025, 12:59 PM NEW YORK – In June, Mr Elon Musk predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) would become smarter than any human by the end of 2026. In July, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said his company’s product “is going to reshape the course of human history”. Mr Mark Zuckerberg has imagined creating “a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world”. The CEOs are backing up their words with dollars. Five of the biggest tech companies are together spending an estimated US$371 billion (S$482 billion) in 2025 on the massive data centres necessary to train and run complex AI models. That figure is expected to increase in the years to come: McKinsey & Co projects that data centres will require US$5.2 trillion in spending by 2030 to keep up with demand for AI. All that spending raises the question: Will AI ever produce enough revenue to justify the price? The maths is daunting. In 2025, AI technology is expected to generate US$60 billion in revenue, according to one estimate by writers Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren of AI-focused newsletter Exponential View. That number will need to increase dramatically if tech companies want to recoup costs. In September, Bain & Co calculated that Big Tech would need US$2 trillion in additional annual revenue to pay for data centre expenditures by 2030 and projected a shortfall of US$800 billion a year even under ideal circumstances. If AI giants and their investors can’t make their money back, then we’re talking about a historically large case of overbuilding and overinvestment. There might even be a word for that. “I believe it’s a bubble,” says Mr Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital Management, a self-described contrarian hedge fund with about US$300 million in assets under management. “Will there ever be a payback on this stuff? I think the answer is ‘highly unlikely’.” Covering the cost of just 2025’s build-out will require additional revenue of US$480 billion, according to Mr Kupperman’s calculations. Where that will come from is unclear, especially considering that for most users, ChatGPT is currently free. “If they charged you a couple dollars every time you queried ChatGPT, I don’t know if they’d have a market,” Mr Kupperman says. It doesn’t help that graphics processing units (GPUs) – the essential computer chips for AI that account for a significant chunk of data centre costs – depreciate quickly. In past bubbles, such as the railroad construction of the 19th century or the telecommunications build-out of the early 2000s, the overspending at least created lasting infrastructure. Even if people didn’t use the railroad tracks right away, they remained useful for decades, as was the fibre-optic cable laid in the 1990s. GPUs, in contrast, appear to have a shelf life of just a few years before they need to be reassigned to more basic AI tasks. The maths makes AI spending seem less like a flywheel than a hamster wheel. Then there are the bottlenecks, which could prevent many planned AI factories from reaching completion. While data centres typically take two to three years to build, hooking them up to an energy source can take up to eight years, according to Boston Consulting Group. So it will take that much longer for data centres to begin generating revenue. And that’s if the energy is available at all: A 2024 review by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the data centre capital of the world, concluded that meeting the unconstrained energy needs of this infrastructure would be “very difficult”, and even meeting half of that demand would be “difficult”. Sceptics also point to disappointing performance by the AI tools themselves. A much-cited study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab found that 95 per cent of AI projects piloted by businesses have produced no measurable return. McKinsey reported that almost eight in 10 companies that adopt generative AI see “no significant bottom-line impact”. OpenAI released GPT-5 in August to tepid reviews, raising questions about the industry’s assumption that more data is better when it comes to AI. Finally, observers concerned about an AI bubble point to the circularity of recent deals – for example, Nvidia is selling chips to OpenAI while also investing in it – that has echoes of the telecoms bubble. They also worry about the growing opacity of funding mechanisms. In August, Meta Platforms raised US$29 billion for data centres from private credit firms. Big start-ups such as OpenAI and CoreWeave have also leaned on private credit for data centre financing. These agreements often take the form of obscure special purpose vehicles, which keep the debt off the big companies’ balance sheets and make the health of the investments hard to track. There are also signs that the exposure of average investors to these risky bets is growing, as private credit firms raise money from insurance companies and real-estate-focused exchange-traded funds invest in data centres, according to investor and writer Paul Kedrosky. And of course anyone who owns shares in a mutual fund is most likely betting on data centres via Big Tech stocks. The AI bulls – which, judging by stock market trends, include most investors – aren’t too concerned. In their view, revenue from generative AI is growing and will continue to grow. And while the infrastructure build-out looks big, it’s not that big compared with certain past bubbles, write Mr Azhar and Mr Warren of Exponential View. As a proportion of gross domestic product, spending on railroads during that boom was four times greater than current spending on AI infrastructure. Most important, Big Tech companies have plenty of cash; they can afford to lose a few hundred billion dollars. Mr Altman and Mr Zuckerberg have both suggested they’re focused on the long game rather than immediate profits. The question is how long their investors will take the same view. The challenge of any bubble is not knowing if it will pop but when. Entrepreneurial studies clinical assistant professor Erik Gordon of the University of Michigan says the first signs of fading optimism are likely to appear in venture capital funding for AI start-ups. “You might see the size of funding rounds go down,” he says. Public stock prices would most likely follow. (For now, it’s still up, up, up.) Until then, the AI explosion is something of a Rorschach test: What you see depends on how you view AI’s prospects broadly. Haters have been calling the boom financially unsustainable for ages. Those who believe in the technology’s potential seem to have faith that it will still grow and improve fast enough to recoup costs – even if the traditional laws of the market suggest otherwise.
