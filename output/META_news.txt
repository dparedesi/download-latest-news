The U.S. celebrates Veteran’s Day today, and we are sending a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has served. Speaking of gratitude, Warren Buffett dropped his ‘farewell’ letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders yesterday and offered a master class in introspection, recognizing his own good luck, and passing on sage advice. I’d highly recommend reading the letter in its entirety, but here are a few lessons for leaders I think are worth underscoring: Curb Your Envy: “What often bothers very wealthy CEOs—they are human, after all—is that other CEOs are getting even richer. Envy and greed walk hand in hand. And what consultant ever recommended a serious cut in CEO compensation or board payments?” Learn From Failure: “Don’t beat yourself up over past mistakes—learn at least a little from them and move on. It is never too late to improve.” Measure Success Through Impact: “Greatness does not come about through accumulating great amounts of money, great amounts of publicity or great power in government. When you help someone in any of thousands of ways, you help the world. Kindness is costless but also priceless. Whether you are religious or not, it’s hard to beat The Golden Rule as a guide to behavior.” Ponder Your Legacy: Buffett talks about how FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, once revered by Americans in the 1930s, “became disgraced for misusing his post.” His advice: “Decide what you would like your obituary to say and live the life to deserve it … You will never be perfect, but you can always be better.” Bet on America: “Our stock price will move capriciously, occasionally falling 50% or so as has happened three times in 60 years under present management. Don’t despair; America will come back and so will Berkshire shares.”Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com Softbank offloads Nvidia Softbank on Tuesday sold its entire stake in chipmaker Nvidia, pocketing $5.8 billion in a surprise move. Masayoshi Son’s company more than doubled its quarterly net profit thanks in large part to its bet on OpenAI. Shutdown may ease A splinter group of Democrats joined Senate Republicans in passing a measure to reopen the government on Monday night. The legislation now goes to the House, which is expected to take it up no later than Wednesday. Meanwhile, flight cancellations and delays spread amid a shortage of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay. President Trump on Monday threatened to “dock” the pay of any controllers who take time off. CoreWeave results AI data-center and infrastructure operator CoreWeave nearly doubled its revenue backlog to $55.6 billion, surpassing a critical Wall Street benchmark, though its debt increased and it revised down its full-year revenue guidance. Investors are following CoreWeave closely since it could be “a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up,” Fortune’s Amanda Gerut reports. Turmoil at the BBC The crisis at the BBC deepened on Monday after President Trump threatened to sue the broadcaster for $1 billion over the erroneous editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021. Two BBC executives have already resigned over the matter; the president has demanded an apology and compensation for “harm caused.” The real cost of Trump’s tariff dividend President Trump’s proposed $2,000 tariff dividend for all Americans (excluding “high income people”) will cost more than twice the revenue generated by tariffs, the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found. The extra cost would have to be added to the already ballooning federal deficit. UBS economists’ labor market concerns UBS economists in their latest “US Economics Weekly” note compared the national labor market to a bathtub that is losing water (total jobs) as layoffs persist and the flow of jobs slows. “That is a material risk to the outlook,” the investment bank wrote.

Title: Ad Tech Briefing: AppLovin’s AI-fueled surge and The Trade Desk’s stumble show where investors are placing their bets

Full Content:
Join us Dec. 1-3 in New Orleans for the Digiday Programmatic Marketing Summit This Ad Tech Briefing covers the latest in ad tech and platforms for Digiday+ members and is distributed over email every Tuesday at 10 a.m. ET. More from the series → AppLovin and The Trade Desk emerged as the clear attention-grabbers in this ad tech earnings window — but for very different reasons, and with very different signals about how investors are reading the sector’s future. AppLovin stock, FTW AppLovin’s third-quarter numbers were the kind that usually end an argument. Revenue jumped 68% year over year to $1.4 billion, with net income and adjusted EBITDA growing even faster as the company leans into its AXON-driven advertising platform and shrinks its legacy gaming footprint. The market’s reaction was briskly positive, as the company’s stock popped (see table below). However, what makes that reaction stand out is what it seemed to ignore. Just a month earlier, a Bloomberg report revealed that the U.S. SEC was probing AppLovin’s data-collection practices, following short-seller allegations that it skirted platform terms to squeeze more targeting out of Meta and mobile ecosystems. The stock fell about 14% on that headline in October, and further coverage detailed how the company shut down an “Array” product that had become a focal point of those accusations. Yet when the Q3 numbers hit, Wall Street effectively compartmentalized the regulatory overhang, although, some analysts explicitly advised caution: growth forecasts point to a deceleration from the current breakneck pace, and the SEC probe is still unresolved. But for now, the combination of scale, margins and AI narrative appears to outweigh the governance red flags in investors’ models. Big Tech vs. The open web Meanwhile, The Trade Desk’s Q3 tells a more nuanced tale about sentiment toward the demand side of the ecosystem. The company delivered $739 million in revenue, up 18% year over year (22% excluding U.S. political spend), beating consensus and continuing its long streak of double-digit top-line growth. CTV outpaced the rest of the business, and video now accounts for roughly half of revenue, underscoring The Trade Desk’s role as the de facto DSP for the “open internet.” And yet, the stock fell 4–7% in the wake of the results, depending on which post-earnings snapshot you look at. Coverage framed it as a classic “great quarter, high bar”: the company beat on revenue and EPS, guided Q4 to at least $840 million, but is still working off a bruising summer reaction to its Q2 earnings. On the company’s subsequent earnings call, CEO Jeff Green again insisted Amazon isn’t a direct competitor because most of its ads target owned-and-operated inventory rather than the “open internet.” However, investors appear split on that framing, with some seeing an independent DSP with durable CTV and retail-media momentum; others worry that Big Tech and retailer networks can squeeze the open web on both inventory and data. The Q3 sell-off doesn’t signal that the market has “given up” on The Trade Desk — but it does show that continued backing for the sector’s flagship DSP now depends on more than just beating the quarter. The story investors are buying has to reconcile competition from Amazon, Google and retailer media with a credible path to sustained 20%-ish growth and healthy cash generation. Collaboration across the middle layers of ad tech is another trend investors are monitoring, and while not explicitly raised on the call, the fact that concerned parties are seeking a “grand bargain” to end months, if not years, of sniping over supply-path and auction mechanics is likely welcome. Against that backdrop, The Trade Desk and PubMatic — which reported its own Q3 earnings as Digiday was going to press (see chart) — announced a new API-based integration for deal-ID campaigns using The Trade Desk’s Price Discovery and Provisioning, or PDP, API. Observers have characterized the move as a pragmatic reset: both sides acknowledge that legacy deal-ID plumbing is too brittle for modern CTV and curated marketplaces, and are willing to align on common pipes to keep spend flowing. For markets, deals like this suggest that even when buy- and sell-side rhetoric turns heated, the largest players will still cut operational truces where there’s real money on the table. In a sector where investors have been burned by opaque auctions and fee stacks, cleaner integrations that promise more predictable yield and fewer failed deals are a modest but meaningful de-risking signal. ‘Death of the open web’ narrative The other axis driving valuations is how convincingly companies can connect AI to revenue — and how quickly they can prove it on the open web, not just in pitch decks. DoubleVerify’s Q3 is a case in point. Revenue grew 11% to about $189 million and margins remained robust, but sales came in a touch light versus some expectations, and Q4 guidance implied high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. The stock promptly dropped around 19%. On the company’s earnings call, DoubleVerify leaned hard into its new DV AI Verification suite: Agent-ID to classify LLM agents and bots, and “AI SlopStopper” to detect and block synthetic or manipulated media across the open web. Management framed AI not just as a risk but as a margin lever, arguing that generative tools can 20x–2000x labeling productivity while opening new revenue lines in social, CTV and LLM-mediated advertising. Analysts pressed on how quickly those innovations could move the growth needle, and DV sketched a medium-term goal of taking social, streaming TV and AI verification from under 30% of revenue to roughly 50%. The share-price reaction suggests investors believe the strategy, but aren’t yet prepared to pay up for it without clearer acceleration. Elsewhere, Teads, provided the cautionary mirror image. Its Q3 revenue came in around $319 million, missing expectations and down roughly 15% year over year on a pro-forma basis, with EPS swinging to a loss — and the stock slumped by about 30%. On its earnings call, management laid out a turnaround plan targeting $35 million in annualized EBITDA improvement and highlighted CTV and AI-driven initiatives as the growth engine. Analysts focused heavily on how quickly Teads could stabilize core markets like the U.S., U.K., and France and whether its AI and CTV bets would stem share loss to rivals. The verdict from Wall Street — at least for now — is that execution risk is high, with the highly leveraged 2024 deal that led to the union of Outbrain and Teads, plus the “death of the open web” narrative, dragging down its stock price. In total, the above developments from last week point to a more nuanced view of ad tech’s prospects, rather than the blanket enthusiasm (or cynicism) of past cycles. On one side are scaled platforms such as AppLovin and The Trade Desk, which can still post high-teens to high-double-digit growth, invest aggressively in AI and CTV, and throw off substantial cash. On the other hand, there are infrastructure and media players that must prove AI is more than a cost line — that it can deepen moats in measurement, verification, and curated inventory rather than simply compressing margins. “Every player is optimizing for their own incentives instead of the health of the ecosystem. And somewhere in that noise, publishers — the ones creating the content and context that make advertising possible — are being left out.” – Renowned industry consultant, Jana Meron, of Lioness Strategies, says the quiet part out loud. News Corp explores multi-LLM licensing playbook News Corp is scoping out the potential for a multi-licensing LLM portfolio strategy, according to sources familiar with the matter. Ranking is out, visibility is in as publishers chip away at AI search optimization The AI search era is rewiring the goal from ranking to visibility, and publishers are slowly but steadily tuning their playbooks. Inside Bayer’s ad tech and data strategy to find new customers and prepare for agentic AI Bayer is bringing its custom algorithm in-house so it can be more hands-on with the model that undergirds its programmatic ad placements, working with Chalice and Snowflake to achieve this aim. Google is helping WPP build Websites for AI search engines Google is giving WPP-owned agencies access to tools that help marketers better appear on AI search engines, including Google’s AI Overviews and rivals such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Perplexity. ID5 acquires TrueData, combining strengths to create the most comprehensive ID solution Financial terms of the deal were not publicly disclosed, but the U.K.-based company states that by bringing TrueData’s graph on board, the company is upping its U.S. operations and strengthening its Adaptive Identity technology. The DOJ and Google sharpen their remedy proposals as the two sides prepare for closing arguments Both sides filed new post-remedy trial briefs on Monday, with the DOJ and Google each citing the phrase in support of their conflicting viewpoints on a potential divestiture of Google’s sell-side ad exchange. At a time when media careers are often measured in months rather than years, the editorial director is something of an anomaly. While Netflix’s intention was more transparency and clarity over reach methodology, marketers aren’t yet confident in how accurate it really is. Shifts of this scale always create winners and losers. The task for agency bosses is making sure they’re on the right side of that line.

Title: CoreWeave’s earnings report highlights $56 billion in contracted revenue, but its guidance and share price tick down amid AI infrastructure bubble fears

Amanda Gerut is the west coast editor at Fortune, overseeing publicly traded businesses, executive compensation, Securities and Exchange Commission regulations, and investigations. CoreWeave needed a lot of things to go right on Monday as it released third-quarter financial results, and one of the most critical was showing that its contracted future revenues could hit a $50 billion target Wall Street had set as a benchmark for the AI data-center and infrastructure operator. In its announcement, CoreWeave confirmed it nearly doubled its revenue backlog, which includes “remaining performance obligations” (RPOs) and other amounts it estimates will be recognized as revenue, to $55.6 billion, up from $30 billion the previous quarter. The surging backlog, which represents future revenues from customers, was driven by contracts with Meta, OpenAI, and French AI startup Poolside. Earnings and revenue, meanwhile, both beat analysts’ consensus estimates. The company also reported an increase in the debt on its balance sheet, however, and it revised its full-year revenue guidance downward. Following its earnings release and call with analysts, the stock dropped 6% in after-hours trading. Some investors have trained a gimlet eye on CoreWeave as more skeptics kick the tires of the booming AI trade and the concurrent infrastructure buildout. Concerns about CoreWeave, which some see as a potential canary-like indicator of weakness in the AI ramp-up, and about the AI build-out in general have sent the stock on a journey that has seen it tumble more than 30% from mid-August highs. The downward revision in revenue guidance reflected delays in construction of some of CoreWeave’s data centers. “While we are experiencing relentless demand for our platform, data center developers across the industry are also enduring unprecedented pressure across supply chains,” CEO Michael Intrator said during the analysts’ call. “In our case, we are affected by temporary delays related to a third-party data-center developer who is behind schedule.” Chief financial officer Nitin Agrawal offered full-year 2025 revenue guidance of $5.05 billion to $5.15 billion, down slightly from the guidance Intrator offered on the second-quarter earnings call, of between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. The customer impacted by the delay agreed to adjust the delivery schedule and extend the expiration date, Intrator said, which means CoreWeave will maintain the total value of the original contract. Agrawal said the company’s 2025 capex spending would be between $12 billion to $14 billion, down significantly from the $20 billion to $23 billion Intrator forecast last quarter. However, Agrawal said CoreWeave expects 2026 capex to soar. “Given the significant growth in our backlog and continued insatiable demand for our cloud services, we expect capex in 2026 to be well in excess of double that of 2025,” Agrawal said. CoreWeave reported revenues of $1.4 billion for the quarter, up from $584 million in the same quarter last year and beat analysts’ estimates. Profitability, at least by traditional GAAP measures, remains elusive. CoreWeave reported a net loss of $110 million, although it was an improvement over its $359.8 million loss in the third quarter last year and also better than analysts expected. Adjusted net loss, which shows financial performance without extraordinary items, was $41 million for the quarter compared to the same quarter last year when it was break-even, Agrawal said. Adjusted EBITDA, which shows earnings without certain one-time expenses, were $838 million in the third quarter, compared to $379 million in Q3 2024. Operating income, a metric that shows profit from core businesses, fell to $51.9 million, compared to the same quarter last year when it was $117.1 million. Operating margins shrunk to 4% from 20%. Meanwhile, adjusted operating income, which shows a different view on core business performance, was $217 million for the third quarter, compared to $125 million in the third quarter of 2024, said Agrawal, the CFO. CoreWeave’s third quarter adjusted operating margin was 16%, due to higher revenues, lower costs, and the timing of data center deliveries from third parties. While Monday was just this side of positive for CoreWeave, analysts who are bearish on the AI cloud computing company remain leery of its finances. They see the company as at risk of being overwhelmed by the significant financial commitments it has taken on to build out data centers, which currently look disproportionately large compared to its revenues and cash flow. Based on its latest earnings release, CoreWeave has $9.7 billion in bills due within the next 12 months on its balance sheet, and a total of $14 billion in current and longer-term debt. Last quarter, those figures were $7.6 billion and $11 billion, respectively. CoreWeave also has $34 billion in scheduled lease payments on contracts that will commence between now and 2028. Interest expense reached $311 million for the quarter, nearly triple the figure from the year-earlier period, of $104 million. CoreWeave bulls, meanwhile, remain confident that revenues from the company’s book of contracts will eventually far outstrip its debt obligations. During the past three months, CoreWeave has announced a spate of significant deals, booking a $14.2 billion deal to provide Meta with computing capacity and an agreement with Poolside for a data center with 40,000 of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: CoreWeave’s stock wavers on data center delay and lower revenue forecast
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/11/10/coreweaves-stock-wavers-data-center-delay-lower-revenue-forecast/
Time Published: 2025-11-10T23:36:51Z

UPDATED 18:36 EST / NOVEMBER 10 2025 by Mike Wheatley Artificial intelligence compute infrastructure company CoreWeave Inc. delivered better-than-expected financial results today, but its stock lost ground after-hours when it revealed a tepid revenue forecast and said one of its third-party developers has fallen behind schedule on a key data center facility. The company reported a third-quarter loss before certain costs such as stock compensation of 22 cents per share, easily beating Wall Street’s estimate of a 40-cent-per-share loss. Revenue for the period rose by an impressive 134%, to $1.36 billion, also surpassing the analysts’ target of $1.29 billion. The increased revenue had the effect of narrowing CoreWeave’s net loss considerably to just $110 million, down from a $360 million loss in the year-ago period. CoreWeave Chief Executive Michael Intrator (pictured) said the company’s results are a reflection of its disciplined execution across every part of its business. “CoreWeave’s position as the essential cloud for AI has never been stronger as we drive growth through focus and innovation to power the next generation of AI,” he added. The fortunes of CoreWeave are tied directly to those of the AI industry, because the company specializes in renting out access to Nvidia Corp.’s graphics processing units and has secured numerous multibillion-dollar deals with key cloud infrastructure providers such as Microsoft Corp. and Google LLC. The company said its backlog stood at $55.6 billion at the end of the quarter, with 2.9 gigawatts in power under contract, up from 2.2 gigawatts three months earlier. The company made some big announcements during the quarter, notably including a $6.5 billion expansion of its partnership with OpenAI Group PBC. It also signed a new, six-year deal with Meta Platforms Inc. that could ultimately be worth up to $14.2 billion, along with another contract from an undisclosed “leading hyperscaler.” Despite the progress on the deal front, Intrator told analysts on a conference call that the company remains “supply-constrained.” He explained that the problem has to do with partly completed “powered-shell” data centers where the company intends to set up its own infrastructure. Intrator also admitted that one of the company’s third-party contractors has fallen behind schedule. He told analysts that the delay in construction won’t impact the company’s backlog, because the customer affected by the holdup has agreed to adjust its delivery schedule. The original value of the contract will be maintained, he added. “There was a problem at one data center that’s impacting us, but there are 32 data centers in our portfolio,” Intrator pointed out. However, one problem with that delay is that it’s likely going to hurt CoreWeave’s near-term fortunes. The company offered a full-year revenue forecast of between $5.05 billion and $5.15 billion, below Wall Street’s target of $5.29 billion. CoreWeave has enjoyed a wild ride since going public on the Nasdaq in March, when it sold its shares at a price of $40 each. The stock closed at $105.61, representing a gain of more than 165%, only to fall almost 6% in late trading today. Still, it continues to outperform the Nasdaq by a long way, with the broader index up just 32% over the same period. Holger Mueller of Constellation Research praised CoreWeave, not only for its “outstanding growth” but also for proving the many skeptics in the AI industry wrong, as it made great strides towards profitability. “Its earnings-per-share loss improved considerably, and with another quarter like this it should be in the black,” the analyst said. Having demonstrated it has a viable business, CoreWeave now needs to focus on carefully managing its growth, the analyst believes. “The focus has to shift to following the supply chain, delivering more data center capacity and running customer workloads successfully,” he said. “At the moment, it does face some challenges, with delays in one of its data center build outs, and this will need to be addressed.” Despite its impressive progress, CoreWeave has had its share of disappointments. Last month shareholders of the data center infrastructure company Core Scientific Inc. voted to decline a $9 billion acquisition offer, claiming it was undervalued and didn’t recognize its growth potential. CoreWeave chose not to increase its offer, and so the deal has been terminated. “We respect the decision of Core Scientific’s stockholders regarding our previously announced merger agreement,” CoreWeave said in a statement. “Our partnership with Core Scientific remains strong and will continue to execute on shared growth opportunities. CoreWeave’s vision and strategy remain unchanged.” Nevertheless, CoreWeave is still planning to spend lots of money in the coming months, acquisitions or not. On the conference call, Chief Financial Officer Nitin Agrawal said the company’s capital expenditures in fiscal 2026 will be “well in excess of double” its $12 billion to $14 billion forecast for the current year.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect CoreWeave Stock To Move After Earnings on Monday

CoreWeave (CRWV) is slated to report third-quarter results after the closing bell on Monday, with traders expecting a big post-earnings move for the stock. Options pricing suggests traders anticipate shares of CoreWeave could move up to 14% in either direction by the end of this week. A move of that size would push the stock up to $118.70 at the high end, erasing some of the losses incurred amid last week’s slump in tech stocks, or drag it down to $89.30, its lowest price since early September. CoreWeave has only reported quarterly results twice since it began trading, and neither has helped the stock. In May, shares fell more than 2% the day after the company's earnings were released, despite better-than-expected results, with revenue increasing more than 400% year-over-year. Shares tumbled more than 20% after earnings in August, when the company reported a wider-than-expected loss. CoreWeave shares have soared since debuting in March, with investors looking past the company's unprofitability to focus on surging revenue driven by AI demand. How investors react to the company's results on Monday could reflect Wall Street's risk appetite and sentiment pertaining to the AI stock rally. Granted, CoreWeave's shares advanced considerably leading up to both prints. The stock gained nearly 70% between its late-March IPO and May’s report, and rose about 120% heading into August’s results. This time could be different. Leading into Monday's session, CoreWeave shares were down about 30% since its last earnings. CoreWeave's revenue has soared in the last year and a half amid a surge in demand for AI-enabling cloud computing platforms. The company landed several major customers last quarter, signing a $14 billion deal with Meta Platforms (META), a $6 billion deal with Nvidia (NVDA), and a $6.5 billion expansion of its existing agreement with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The cloud computing provider is expected to report a third-quarter net loss of $284.4 million, narrowing from a loss of $359.8 million in the year ago quarter. Its revenue is projected to jump 120% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, according to analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Wall Street is split on the outlook for CoreWeave’s stock, with five of the 10 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha calling the stock a “buy,” and the other half assigning it a “hold” rating. Their mean target of $158.83 represents about 53% upside from the stock’s closing price last Friday.

An aerial view of a 33 megawatt data center with closed-loop cooling system is seen on October 20, 2025 in Vernon, California. AI’s massive energy use is giving fossil fuels a lifeline when they should be rapidly phased out in response to the climate emergency. What started as rivulets of hype, hope, and alarm over artificial intelligence have combined into a tsunami-level wave washing over the American consciousness. ChatGPT is the most downloaded application in history, AI stock prices are hitting record market highs, and the American public is giddy about its potential technological upsides and devastated by its role in mental health crises. Less discussed but deeply important are the AI boom’s clear and present dangers to our environment, health, and wallets. That lack of attention to these issues is exactly how President Donald Trump, Big Tech, and the oil and gas industry want it. As Trump attacks climate progress on all fronts, his administration is in lockstep pushing for a fast-tracked AI data center boom fed by gas and coal. It’s critical that AI become part of global climate negotiations—not as an escape hatch for how it could save the planet, but as an urgent threat to people, wildlife, and the atmosphere. It may not be immediately obvious, but AI is a gift to the fossil fuel industry. That’s because AI’s massive energy use is giving fossil fuels a lifeline when they should be rapidly phased out in response to the climate emergency. It’s a huge problem for world leaders as they gather in Brazil for this year’s annual global climate talks, known as COP30. In one of the biggest shifts since last year’s talks, data center expansion to feed energy-intensive AI is straining grids and leading companies and some countries to walk back domestic climate pledges. The Trump administration has cited the power-hungry AI beast as one big excuse for abandoning climate efforts, even as the US disproportionately leads the world in data center pollution. And the great AI energy suck is just getting started, with dozens of massive new data centers slated for construction across the country—and hundreds more around the world. Mark Zuckerberg says one Meta data center will be the size of Manhattan. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, said recently, “I do guess that a lot of the world gets covered in data centers over time.” These data centers demand immense amounts of power, land, and water for cooling. As one point of comparison, a ChatGPT AI search consumes 10 times as much energy as a normal Google search. Just how bad could data center expansion be for the climate? That’s what we set out to find in our report, Data Crunch: How the AI Boom Threatens to Entrench Fossil Fuels and Compromise Climate Goals. We found that plans for US data center growth, set to be powered primarily by fossil gas, as well as notoriously dirty coal, could triple by 2035. That comes with a huge cost to efforts to preserve a livable planet and limit the deadly flooding, extreme heat, and destructive fires of the climate emergency. Unchecked, the fossil-fueled data center expansion could account for 10% of US economy-wide emissions and 44% of the power sector emissions allowable to meet the US climate target under the Paris Agreement. With a gas-fed AI boom, all other electricity-consuming sectors, like homes and buildings, would need to cut their emissions by 60% more to keep pace with that target, set by former President Joe Biden and still in effect under Paris Agreement terms. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. If new AI data centers were instead powered by renewables like solar and wind, they’d be only 4% of power sector emissions and would barely affect our ability to meet the US climate goal. Despite Trump exiting the Paris Agreement, Biden’s target stands as the United States’ contribution to global efforts to combat climate change. While Trump dismisses climate change as a “con job,” there is broad scientific agreement that every degree of global heating worsens its deadly, destructive effects on people and wildlife. A study last month found that accelerating climate harms mean that half a million people now die every year from extreme heat—an average of one person a minute. The unbridled expansion of data centers to feed AI will only further intensify such fatal consequences and others, including crop loss to drought, spread of disease, and loss of imperiled plants and animals. These consequences are exactly what world leaders gathered in Belem, Brazil, for COP30 are trying to prevent, by limiting global heating by every fraction of a degree that they can. That goal can’t be achieved without serious guardrails on AI data center development. It’s critical that AI become part of global climate negotiations—not as an escape hatch for how it could save the planet, but as an urgent threat to people, wildlife, and the atmosphere. Before AI unleashes a fresh hell of global heating, countries should commit to zeroing out the emissions from data centers by using renewable energy and storage. From Virginia to Tucson to Kosciuko County, Indiana, communities around the country have sprouted near-overnight campaigns to protect their water and electricity from being consumed by data centers and to prevent rate hikes to subsidize two of the wealthiest industries on Earth. Besides playing defense, now is the time to be proactive and question whether data centers serve the public interest despite their many harms. If local communities still think so, they can pass strict regulations to ensure that data centers are powered fully by on-site renewable energy and batteries. If more power is needed, Big Tech companies can pay for residences to get rooftop solar and storage, heat pumps, and energy efficient appliances to free up capacity on the grid for data center neighbors. Amid all the hype and seeming inevitability of AI dominance, human beings have a chance now to proactively consider what relationship we want with this technology—and the environmental price we’re willing to pay. The COP30 climate talks will be a starting place for the world to look carefully at AI’s climate consequences. The tsunami of AI hype and the Trump destruction machine make for daunting foes. But they don’t have to wash away our resolve to leave this world better than we found it. What started as rivulets of hype, hope, and alarm over artificial intelligence have combined into a tsunami-level wave washing over the American consciousness. ChatGPT is the most downloaded application in history, AI stock prices are hitting record market highs, and the American public is giddy about its potential technological upsides and devastated by its role in mental health crises.

Δ Maybe an innovation saved a lot of our time. Or it made us live longer. Made us more productive workers who could command a higher premium on our time. Or enabled us to pack more things into the limited time we have. Some innovations have done most of the above. Innovations in time have massively improved and extended our lives over the last several centuries. And there’s no letting up. The next wave of disruption will come from those who deliberately innovate around time. Those who see time not as the tick of fixed seconds, but as a human asset whose value has almost unlimited potential. To find inspiration for the next breakthrough, decacorn, and more, catalysts should study time. No asset is more valuable, or more limited, than time. Advertisement: Scroll to Continue Each day, we get just so much. Twenty-four hours, 1,440 minutes, 86,400 seconds. If we don’t use it, we lose it. So, we try to make the most of it. To do that, we trade it, swap it and compress it, each day and over our lifetimes. We can use some of our time endowment to work and make money to buy things. By using our time to learn when we are young, we can earn more money and enjoy our time more when we are older. Just like people value their houses and businesses value their capital stocks, people value their time. In the U.S., economic studies find that the average person values their time on earth at around $13 million. That is based on looking at how much people must be paid to take risks that could end their lives. The government uses that figure to evaluate benefits and costs involving lives. That makes the value of the stock of time for the U.S. population of 340 million people around $4.5 quadrillion (340.1 million people times $13.1 million per life). By comparison, the U.S. housing stock is worth a measly $55 trillion according to Zillow; the total fixed capital stock was worth $87 trillion in 2024 according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis; and the total value of companies on public exchanges in the U.S. was $68 trillion at the end of September. A more precise estimate of the value of time would account for the fact that the value of life and life expectancy vary with age. But when you get to quadrillions, who’s really counting? Governments, businesses and innovators should treat time as what it truly is. A national and global asset. And like every other great asset, its value can grow through disruptive innovation. The better we use it, the richer the world becomes. Almost 90% of American farms didn’t have electricity as late as 1935. Robert Caro’s famous biography of Lyndon Johnson, “The Path to Power,” shows what that meant to the people living in Hill Country, Texas. A typical farm family used 40 gallons of water a day. To get it, they had to walk to a well located about 250 feet away with a bucket and carry it back to the house. A federal study found the average family spent about 500 hours a year and walked about 1,750 miles just to get water. The family devoted even more hours to hauling wood and washing clothes by hand. Tasks that consumed time and strength, especially for women who, literally, carried the heaviest load. More than half suffered physical injuries from the strain of constant standing and physical labor involved in doing both. Without electricity, there wasn’t much else to do. “No radio; no movies; limited reading—little diversion from the hard day just past and the hard day ahead,” according to Caro. “Living was just drudgery,” one person reminisced. Electrification changed all that, not just in Hill Country, but throughout the U.S. and eventually most of the world. People had more time. And more to do with that time. They could also expect to live longer as electrification reduced infant and adult mortality. Disruptive innovations can make time far more valuable. Entrepreneurs, innovators, businesses and governments have nine levers to find the next big thing in time. 1. Saving Time: Spending less time on one thing so you can spend it on another. Millennia ago, people learned to domesticate horses, which reduced the time spent traveling. Running water from electric pumps likely saved all 500 of those family hours fetching water. The invention of the washing machine reduced the amount of homemaker time to do a load of laundry from 4 hours to 41 minutes. E-commerce companies, from online retailers to meal delivery services, save people the time from traveling to and from physical locations or from cooking their own meals. 2. Making Time. Delaying the Grim Reaper’s visit as long as possible. Innovations like indoor plumbing created cleaner water and prevented the spread of disease. Vaccines largely ended many deadly diseases. The development of antibiotics saved lives. Surgical advances, imaging innovations, and drug development do too. Saving lives means extending the amount of time people have. Globally, average life expectancy increased from 32 years in 1900 to 73 years in 2023, more than doubling the amount of time people have. In the U.S., life expectancy increased from about 50 to almost 80. A perfect human specimen, with the best circumstances and the greatest luck, could make it until 125 based on the upper range for demographic studies. Using that data, in the U.S., we’ve reached only 64% of our potential. 3. Enriching Time. Packing more into the time you have. Electrification expanded the portion of the day people had light. That gave them more time to read and do things that are impossible to do in the dark. The printing press, and communication technologies from the telegraph to radio to broadband, have expanded the ability to benefit from our auditory and visual senses. Smartphones, powered by fast cellular, make those experiences on the go and on demand. Today we can listen to an audiobook, a podcast, or the radio while we’re driving, taking the subway or vacuuming the floors. 4. Monetizing Time. Using time to work to make money for people and their families. Innovations can change the amount of time people work. The time people spend working depends on whether they participate in the labor force, how many hours they work, and when they decide to retire. People can then use that money to buy goods and services, which they combine with their time (think about eating) to create value. The labor force participation of women has increased in the last century in part because household chores, which disproportionately fell on them, took up less time. People can work later in life because they are healthier and have more years available to them. Platforms make it possible for people to pick up gig jobs, participate in side hustles and work-from-home using their available time. Innovations often result in people being paid more because they are more productive. With higher incomes and savings, people can decide to work less and retire earlier, with greater incomes and more wealth. 5. Enjoying Time. Spending more time on leisure activities. The disruptive innovations for time saving and improving innovations have made leisure cheaper, because less time is needed for household chores, and more valuable, because sensory-related innovations provide better ways to spend their time. In 2024, the average American, age 15 and over, spent an average of 5.5 hours a day “in some sort of leisure and sport activity, such as watching TV, socializing, or exercising.” That’s about 37% of waking hours (the average number of hours sleeping was 9.0 hours). An economic study found that adults spent 6.75 more fewer hours a week working for pay or at home, and instead on leisure activities, between 1965 and 2003. This time was worth roughly 8% to 9% of GDP based on how much people could have made from paid work 6. Trading Time. Giving people things for free, or at a discount, in return for them giving some of their attention. Since newspapers were first invented, advertisers have been paying for people to pay attention to them. The idea is simple: advertisers buy space in media, hoping that audiences will notice their ads. People might not enjoy the ads, but they do enjoy the content. In exchange for free or cheaper access to that content, they let advertisers try to capture some of their attention. New media innovations have always created huge value by making leisure more enjoyable. Families in places like Hill Country, for instance, could spend hours listening to the radio or watching TV, paying nothing beyond the cost of the equipment and electricity. My 2020 paper on attention markets estimated that Americans spent about 500 billion hours consuming ad-supported content in 2019. That made the content they were consuming worth roughly $7 trillion, given the opportunity cost of their time. 7. Investing Time. Using time to learn and thereby increasing the value of time later in life. People, in most developed countries, invest a large part of their time through their teens, and often beyond, learning. This increases the value of their time, for working and themselves, later in their lives. A 2020 U.S. study by Fed economists found that kids, from kindergarten through high school, spent 36% of their waking hours over the week on class time and enrichment activities, including homework. (The data are from 1997, 2002, and 2007.) Investing in time differs in two main ways from the other levers of innovation. It’s not like choosing to watch TV, clean the house, or pick up hours with side hustles. In the U.S., and many countries, kids are compelled to invest time in learning by the government and by their parents. The logic is that it’s good for the kids and good for the country. Education hasn’t had a true disruption in centuries. Public schooling and standardized curricula were the last big innovations, and online learning has yet to deliver on its promise, with the exception of foreign languages. In 2024, grade 12 reading scores in the U.S. were the worst in three decades and math scores the lowest since 2005. 8. Accelerating Time. Shortening the time between the generation and delivery of information. People can make more and better decisions when they get information more quickly. Disruptive innovations have sharply decreased the time needed to convey information and, therefore, the choices people can make at any moment in time. Cheaper paper helped transmit information easily over long distances. The speed increased with the development of horse-based delivery services. In the U.S., sending mail on the stagecoach took weeks. The short-lived specialty Pony Express could move mail in days. It was replaced with the telegraph, which was nearly instantaneous aside from going to telegraph offices to send and retrieve messages. Economists have examined the value of faster time in commerce. Before the successful launch of the transatlantic telegraph on July 28, 1866, it took 7 to 16 days to send information between the U.S. and Great Britain. It was almost immediate after that. The faster transmittal times reduced the price spread for cotton between New York and Liverpool by 35%. By reducing price distortions, it resulted in economic efficiencies that were worth about 8.4% of the value of the exports. Of course, the internet and related communication technologies have massively accelerated time. Now it can take just a few seconds to buy from sellers around the world, to take just one example. 9. Multiplying Time. Increasing the total of the collective hours of everyone’s time, including their working time. Setting the warm and fuzzies aside, societies depend on the collective hours people spend working, creating, and paying taxes. People make the goods and services we consume or trade with other countries. People come up with the ideas that power innovation. And workers ultimately pay most of the taxes to finance everything from national defense to basic research to social welfare. Europe now faces an “existential crisis” in part because people work fewer hours and have fewer children, who will supply working time in the future. Most developed countries have increasingly severe time shortages and will eventually face crises too. Countries can multiply time by encouraging later retirement, higher workforce participation, longer hours, and immigration. The eight other innovations in time are important drivers. Countries can also try to encourage families to have more babies, but there’s not much evidence that works. Advanced applications of artificial intelligence might be the disruptive innovation we need to solve the great time shortage: it could create human substitutes and increase the productivity of human working time. We’re not ready to count humans out, though. Entrepreneurs, innovators and investors searching for their next breakthrough should treat time as a resource class: measurable, improvable and ripe for disruption. That goes for governments, too. The addressable market isn’t literally $4.5 quadrillion. But that is a proxy for the enormous potential of the nine levers to innovate time. And how even small gains in how we create, extend, or enhance it can generate enormous economic returns. Economists have developed clever data-driven methods for estimating the value that people place on their time that can help size investment opportunities and ROIs. We have put rigor into the old saying that “time is money.” Economists look at how much people have to be paid to give up time, say, for work. Or how much people will pay to save time, like for a faster commute. These aren’t ivory-tower exercises. They drive federal cost-benefit analysis of proposed investments. The simplest approach is based on wages. A person could go to the beach or do some chores around the house instead of working another hour. If they are willing to take $20 to work an extra hour for a gig job, then that must be more than the value of an hour doing something else. The wage-hour tradeoff is hard to pin down in practice because many people have fixed salaries or must work a set number of hours. But the after-average after-tax wage, about $17.83 now, turns out to be a good proxy for the value of time for the average person. Instacart claimed it saved people more than 700 million hours between 2012 and 2023 because they didn’t have to go to the grocery store. At $17.83 an hour, it saved people more than $1.2B. The value of time depends on the situation. An hour of work may be more or less pleasant. The time spent on a subway ride isn’t as costly if a person can listen to music on their smartphone. People hate standing in line at checkout, which is why many opt not to and order things online. To get context-specific estimates, economists conduct surveys that try to get people to reveal how much they value time spent in various activities. The U.S. Department of Transportation used these surveys to value savings in local personal travel at about $12.50 an hour. Recent studies estimate the value of spending time using social media. They find that you would have to pay people a lot to go without. Economists have also developed data-driven methods for putting a dollar value on extending life. People make many decisions that result in small changes in the probability of their dying. Many involve making tradeoffs between money and risk: paying extra for a safe car with lower fatality rates in crashes or taking a job that pays more but poses a great risk of a fatal accident. People don’t act as if their lives are worth an infinite amount of money. Most of the studies, and the most robust, look at job decisions. A review, based on 2017 data, found that an employer would have to pay a typical worker another $100 a year to take a job where 1 in 100,000 workers die from a work-related injury. To summarize these results, economists calculate the “value of a statistical life” as the total amount of money that a group of people would pay to avoid one death: 100,000 people would pay $10 million to save one life. The federal government uses this approach to estimate the benefit of investments in activities that could save or cost lives. They currently adopt the $13.1 million per life figure I used earlier. Economists have found that this figure varies across ages. Younger people have more years to value than older people. Economists also use this approach to value innovations in healthcare. A seminal economic study found that the increase in life expectancy between 1970 and 2000 “added about $3.2 trillion to national wealth per year, an uncounted value equal to half of average annual GDP over the period.” Not surprisingly, AI innovators are chasing improvements in healthcare. The real frontier of time isn’t just looking at a clock. It’s looking inside the brain, too. If you buy the Audible version, you can listen to my book, “Matchmakers,” with Richard Schmalensee. It will take you 6 hours and 53 minutes. We were surprised at how many people chose to do that. But the thing about audiobooks is that you can do lots of other things while you are listening. One survey found that 70% of listeners multitasked. A different survey found that 74% of audiobook listeners listen while driving. People also listen while engaging in lots of other activities, like running or doing household chores. They are packing more things into their heads at the same time. Lots of other time innovations do the same. When we talk about people’s time, we’re really talking about the mental processes that happen within a unit of time. What people do with their brains to consume media, work, learn, view ads and more. Economists and psychologists call these processes “attention.” That term covers what regular people call attention, but much more. (An excellent recent survey has the details.) Like money, attention is limited. Using it for one thing means giving it up for another. But unlike money, it’s powered by cognition and choice, and we can decide to engage in more mental activity. We decide what to do with our brains and senses and then do it. We can think of human time along two dimensions. One is clock time, the steady march of seconds. The other is attention per unit of time, which is the variable flow of mental energy that determines how much we accomplish within those seconds. (This is a simplification since attention has many dimensions itself.) Brain time is the flow of attention through the flow of time. This is where the nine levers of time innovation create immense value. Some of those levers give us more clock time, while others enrich attention. Often, they do both. And the beauty of brain time is that multiple levers can be processed during the same unit of time. Clever innovators can make a lot of money from brain time. Google search saved people clock time from going to the library and on other resources to get information. People could even listen to loud music or talk to their colleagues without getting yelled at by the librarian, which enriched their attention. People ended up spending a lot of time doing search queries and looking at search results pages. And they didn’t have to pay a penny. Google built its business on selling slivers of brain time to advertisers. Advertisers can put an ad on the page and have a chance that some people will pay attention. With Facebook and a smartphone, people could interact with friends anywhere anytime, including while watching TV or on the treadmill. Alphabet and Meta are worth about $5 trillion. They make almost all their revenue from the small percentage of visitors who divert brain time to ads. Focusing on time as an improvable asset, and the nine levers for increasing its value, gives entrepreneurs, innovators and businesses a rigorous, disciplined way to identify and size opportunities. It also hands governments a guide to make investments that will maximize the value of human time. The economics of brain time provides a new lens to help shape the innovations and value their potential. Some economists say the era of unprecedented growth has come to an end. After all, it’s hard to top indoor plumbing. I don’t think it’s over. The potential to improve and extend human time is enormous. The financial incentives are powerful. And AI and other new technologies provide the foundation for new leaps forward. It’s about time. David S.

Billions have poured into AI, helping stock valuations soar. But the cracks are starting to show. Slowing adoption, surging costs and elusive profits are fueling warnings that the boom may be headed for a hard reset. The artificial intelligence (AI) party is still in full swing, with tens of billions globally pouring into infrastructure, startups and attracting the best talent. Among the headline announcements this year: ChatGPT parent company Open AI, Softbank and Oracle pledged to invest $500 billion (€433 billion) in AI supercomputers, Open AI and chip giant Nvidia announced a $100 billion fund to maintain the United States' dominance in advanced chips, while Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent hiked investments to help speed up China's ambition to lead AI by 2030. Since ChatGPT’s debut in November 2022, AI-related stocks have added an estimated $17.5 trillion in market value, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, driving around 75% of the S&P 500’s gains and propelling companies like Nvidia and Microsoft to record-breaking valuations. But signs of a hangover are getting harder to ignore. AI usage by corporations is slipping, spending is tightening and the machine learning hype has massively outpaced the profits. Many economists think usage concerns, barely three years into AI going mainstream, dropkick the prevailing narrative that AI would revolutionize how businesses operate by streamlining repetitive tasks and improving forecasting. "The vast bet on AI infrastructure assumes surging usage, yet multiple US surveys show adoption has actually declined since the summer," Carl-Benedikt Frey, professor of AI & work at the UK's University of Oxford, told DW. "Unless new, durable use cases emerge quickly, something will give — and the bubble could burst." The US Census Bureau, which surveys 1.2 million US companies every fortnight, found that AI-tool usage at firms with more than 250 employees dropped from nearly 14% in June to under 12% in August. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video AI’s biggest challenge remains its tendency to hallucinate — generating plausible but false information. Other weaknesses are inconsistent reliability and the poor performance of autonomous agents, which complete tasks successfully only about a third of the time. "Unlike an intern who learns on the job, today’s pretrained [AI] systems don’t improve through experience. We need continual learning and models that adapt to changing circumstances," said Frey. As the gap widens between sky-high expectations and commercial reality, investor enthusiasm for AI is starting to fade. In the third quarter of the year, venture-capital deals with private AI firms dropped by 22% quarter on quarter to 1,295, although funding levels remained above $45 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter, market intelligence firm CB Insights wrote last month. "What perturbs me is the scale of the money being invested compared to the amount of revenue flowing from AI," economist Stuart Mills, a senior fellow at the London School of Economics, told DW. Market leader OpenAI, which is backed by Microsoft, generated $3.7 billion in revenue last year, versus total operating expenses of $8-9 billion. The company says it is on course to make $13 billion this year but is still expected to burn through $129 billion before 2029, news site The Information calculated in September. Mills thinks generative AI companies like Elon Musk's Grok and ChatGPT are "charging far less than they need to make a profit" and should raise subscription prices. Few have quantified the AI bubble more starkly than Julien Garran, partner at UK-based research firm MacroStrategy Partnership. He argues that the sheer volume of capital flowing into AI — despite little evidence of sustainable returns — dwarfs previous speculative frenzies. "We estimate a misallocation of capital equivalent to 65% of US GDP — four times bigger than the housing buildup before the 2008/9 financial crisis and 17 times bigger than the dot-com bust," Garran told DW. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Recent earnings from Big Tech have sparked cautious optimism, but also fresh doubts about AI’s staying power. Data analytics and intelligence platform Palantir's Q3 revenue surged 63% year-over-year, but its stock price fell by up to 7% on the news. AMD and Meta also saw their strong AI-related earnings overshadowed by market concerns about sustainability. That disconnect between soaring valuations and shaky fundamentals is exactly what worries Mills, who sees a widening gap between what AI promises and what it actually delivers to businesses. "The data suggests that AI is not penetrating high enough up the value chain. Loads of people are using it, but it's not being used for tasks that directly contribute to value production," he told DW. Nvidia's upcoming earnings on November 19 may prove a key test of whether the AI boom still has legs. In the second quarter, Nvidia's data center sales alone made up 88% of total revenue, which hit a record $46.7 billion. For Q3, the company has guided $54 billion, projecting 54% year-on-year growth, which would equate to a full-year total of more than $200 billion. "With the exception of Nvidia, which is selling shovels in a gold rush, most generative AI companies are both wildly overvalued and wildly overhyped," Gary Marcus, Emeritus Professor of Psychology and Neural Science at New York University, told DW. "My guess is that it will all fall apart, possibly soon. The fundamentals, technical and economic, make no sense." Garran, meanwhile, believes the era of rapid progress in large language models (LLMs) is drawing to a close, not because of technical limits, but because the economics no longer stack up. "They [AI platforms] have already hit the wall," Garran said, adding that the cost of training new models is "skyrocketing, and the improvements aren’t much better." Striking a more positive tone, Sarah Hoffman, director of AI Thought Leadership at the New York-based market intelligence firm AlphaSense, predicted a "market correction" in AI, rather than a "cataclysmic 'bubble bursting.'" After an extended period of extraordinary hype, enterprise investment in AI will become far more discerning, Hoffmann told DW in an emailed statement, with the focus "shifting from big promises to clear proof of impact." "More companies will begin formally tracking AI ROI [return on investment] to ensure projects deliver measurable returns," she added. Edited by: Uwe Hessler

UPDATED 22:49 EST / NOVEMBER 09 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by David Vellante, David Floyer, Jackie McGuire, Scott Hebner and Christophe Bertrand Our latest forecast indicates that it will take a decade or more for artificial intelligence factory operators and model builders to reach breakeven on their massive capital outlays. Our projections call for nearly $4 trillion in cumulative capital spending outlays by 2030, with just under $2 trillion in cumulative AI revenue generated in that timeframe. We have the crossover point occurring early next decade (2032 on a run-rate basis) then gains far surpassing initial investments by the middle part of the 2030s. Though such projections are invariably subject to constant revision, we believe the size and speed of the initial investments, combined with the challenges of profitably monetizing AI at scale, will require patient capital and long-term thinking to realize durable business results. A short time after we published our first AI factories revenue outlook, OpenAI Group PBC Chief Executive Sam Altman and Microsoft Corp. CEO Satya Nadella introduced new data on the BG2 Pod. As well, on Nov. 4, The Information published projections from Anthropic in an article that also included financial projections on OpenAI based on multiple unnamed sources. This fresh information gives us an opportunity to revisit our figures and do so in the context of economist Erik Brynjolfsson’s productivity J-curve, which explains why new general purpose technologies, like electricity, the steam engine, computing and AI, often experience limited productivity growth at first, because organizations must learn, adapt and reorganize in order to realize benefits. Over time, these innovations tend to outperform expectations. Importantly, our forecasts focus on the business case for AI factory operators currently funding the massive AI buildout – specifically, the big CapEx spenders, including hyperscalers, neoclouds and AI research labs building today’s large language models. We do not attempt in this exercise to go down the “rabbit hole” of forecasting the investment and productivity output from enterprises consuming AI services. These are, however, related as the pace of both consumer and enterprise AI adoptiion will ultimately fuel monetization that AI factory operators will realize. In this Breaking analysis, we analyze these new data points and debate the shape of the AI factories economic curve. We’ll briefly introduce the productivity J-curve, share snippets from the Sam and Satya statements that in many ways speak to the AI productivity paradox. We’ll then revisit our AI factories forecast and assumptions; discuss some of the headwinds the industry must overcome to reach our projections and close with a vision of the future of AI and service as software. The productivity J-curve is a phenomenon where traditional measures of productivity growth initially dip before rising after the adoption of a new general-purpose technology or GPT. This occurs because a novel technology, such as AI, requires significant, but hard-to-measure, intangible investments in areas like employee training and business process redesign. These initial investments can cause temporary negative productivity impacts, but once organizations learn to productively apply the technology, full benefits are realized and productivity growth appears, often in quite dramatic fashion. The concept of the productivity J-curve was developed and modeled by the economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Daniel Rock and Chad Syverson. Recently, on theCUBE at UiPath Fusion, we asked Erik Brynjolfsson to explain the productivity J-curve in the context of today’s AI boom: [Watch Stanford economist Erik Brynjolfsson describe the productivity J-curve and how it relates to AI] Back when I was a young student in Boston, where I guess, I think we first met over there, I was working with Bob Solow, the Nobel Prize winner, and he pointed out that the computer age was everywhere, except the productivity statistics. So he asked me to look into this, and one of the things we saw was that all these companies were investing in these really amazing technologies, but nothing very valuable was coming out. And then later, as we know, in 1995, things started really taking off. And so I did some research, and the same pattern happened with lots of earlier technologies. With electricity, it was like 30 years, in fact, before you had a big boom. The steam engine. And so when I analyzed it, what we see is that these cool technologies, to really get the benefit of them, you have to rethink your business processes. You have to invest in human capital training, and so forth, and all that takes time and energy. And while you’re doing that, there’s not a lot of new output. So you’ve got more input, not a lot of output. By definition, that’s lower productivity. But then once you figure that out, things really take off. So to me, it kind of looks like a J, and we plot it. We did a paper in the American Economic Journal about that, to kind of work out the math of it. And now we’re seeing, I think, the same thing with AI. In our view, the productivity J-curve, at least in part, explains today’s AI return-on-investment paradox. Early adoption of general-purpose technologies is messy, utilization is uneven, workflows and data aren’t ready, and traditional measures of productivity often show dips before durable gains appear in the macro. The latest MIT and recent Enterprise Technology Research data points suggest only modest near-term ROI impact – single digits to low teens of enterprises seeing sustained ROI at scale. We’ve often said that agentic AI will take most of a decade to mature and permeate enterprises broadly. If we count inputs as AI CapEx and outputs as AI factory revenue, current productivity is negative, which helps explain market jitters and bubble talk. We believe near-term skepticism is unsurprising and the payoff depends on raising utilization, improving data quality and putting governed and secure agents into operation so that spend translates to tokens, and token production converts to revenue. Industry consensus had OpenAI revenues at about $13 billion. In a conversation with Altman, Brad Gerstner asked the obvious question: “How can a company with $13 billion in revenue make $1.4 trillion in spend commitments?” This raised Altman’s ire to the point where he spilled some revenue estimates that hadn’t been previously shared. [Watch Altman bristle at the criticisms] Specifically Altman said: Our further research indicates that both of these estimates are run-rate revenue projections. As such, we put OpenAI 2025 revenue at $15 billion. Moreover, in the clip above, Nadella lends credibility to Altman’s statements by claiming he’s never seen a business plan from OpenAI that the company hasn’t met or exceeded. Jackie McGuire of theCUBE Research had the following takeaways on Altman’s and Nadella’s comments: I think their tone tells you a lot about the message. To me, Sam actually sounded a little bit defensive in the “We’re doing well more than 13 billion.” It sounded to me like on one side that we’re doing way better than that. And on the other side, “I’m telling you guys, this is a sure bet. Take the Dodgers in the World Series. I’ve never seen them not lose a game.” There was an article last week in Wired that was called AI is the Bubble to Burst Them All. And it was talking about what the different things are that characterize a bubble, how people talk about it as one of them. And yeah, I don’t know. I just found the tone to be very more defensive than I would expect for somebody that feels really, really secure in the amount of revenue they’re doing. This narrative, as the Wired article reminds us, echoes the hype around RCA in the 1920s. Andrew Ross Sorkin in promoting his new book, “1929,” makes similar comparisons, with OpenAI as today’s analog. But it has faster execution, a bigger installed base and a much more mature communications infrastructure in its favor. Pulling OpenAI’s revenue projections forward suggests a meaningfully higher trajectory for the company. Nadella’s commentary frames OpenAI as an “execution machine” and is encouraging. Coupled with about 800 million monthly active users and what the company claims is 1 million enterprise API customers, demonstrates a blistering cadence and a glimpse of what the next great software company may look like. In the graphic below, we update our earlier AI factory forecast which reframes the datacenter buildout at an accelerated pace. The relevance is this represents the CapEx that ultimately foots the AI bill. Datacenter investments require land, power, water, distribution, thermal systems, and the accelerated stack itself – compute, storage and networking. The AI piece of the forecast (dark brown bars) is astounding and forcing a stack flip to extreme parallelism. The following key additional points are notable: The pace of the buildout steepens relative to our April forecast reflecting disclosures from recent earnings prints and deal signings that indicate OpenAI has secured a disproportionate share of advanced package/graphics processing unit capacity, while Google LLC has stepped up commitments, along with other hyperscalers and Meta Platforms Inc. Taken together, these inputs justify pulling forward AI-factory outlays. As we’ll show below, revenue ramp lags in the model when assessing cumulative spend vs. cumulative revenue. The most recent forecast implies that although hyperscalers, neoclouds and specialist providers will operate much of the capacity, enterprises will ultimately need to underwrite a majority of the economics over time via consumption. This will happen extensively through cloud, neoclouds and colo channels as well as selective on-premises deployments, especially as edge AI matures. While Wall Street rightly notes the hyperscaler and neocloud GPU estates are “lit up,” enterprises running clusters of 1,000-plus GPUs often sit below 30% utilization because of thin parallel-computing muscle memory, immature workflows and data friction. That underutilization is stressed by rapid hardware depreciation; unlike dark fiber in 2000, GPUs lose value fast. In our view, if enterprises cannot translate capacity to tokens and productivity, ROI will accrue elsewhere in the value chain until operating discipline catches up. Endpoints are a potential tailwind as an AI PC refresh cycle will push more inference to the edge, and a return to pragmatic hybrid is likely as organizations balance economics, latency, privacy and the practical limits of data movement. The operational reality is we live in a 12- to 18-month replacement cycle with e-waste and labor challenges implying a perpetual “paint-the-Golden-Gate-Bridge” refresh cadence applied to rows and racks of infrastructure. Hybrid AI will also be deployed by enterprises. As such, choice and flexibility across on-prem/colo/public will matter and upgrade timelines will vary, which argues for architectures that let teams “tap the public” while local capacity evolves (the labor and talent constraints are visible in the workforce data we present later). Data gravity and storage economics are also at play. We expects a meaningful share of cost to sit in storage and data management, not just GPUs. We will likely see renewed interest in deep, economical tiers (including tape) and a storage-vendor arms race to live closer to the accelerators, because data readiness, lineage and metadata for agentic workflows are gating factors to scale. The net is the spend is real and earlier, but breakeven will stretch beyond a decade with improvements in utilization, fabric efficiency and governed data pipelines taking time. In our opinion, the operating agenda is raise money, do deals, build fast, secure power and GPUs, increase utilization, compress network latency, harden governed data planes and sequence hybrid capacity so depreciation curves don’t outrun value realization. The data below represents revenue output from AI factory operators. It does not represent the value created by mainstream enterprises driving productivity and contributing to the macro gross domestic product uplift. Forecasting that impact is a separate exercise that requires assumptions about firm level productivity impacts. Rather this forecast is meant to help us model the revenue return on the massive CapEx buildup happening with AI, which will power a massive productivity boom in our view. The following five key messages are conveyed in the data: Our updated revenue forecast reflects a steeper commercialization curve for AI factories, with OpenAI’s trajectory set higher based on the new information. The near-term ~$20 billion run rate this year and a path to ~$100 billion by 2027, is based on growth initially fueled by consumer/prosumer demand and then accelerated by a rapid cadence of APIs and software that connect to enterprise data. We group Google and Anthropic as a combined partnership because TPU capacity and tight technical alignment make joint scaling plausible even as each maintains distinct channels; and Anthropic has a close partnership with AWS. We assume China’s block rises on restricted access to U.S. technology, which concentrates domestic investment and demand. A core debate from theCUBE Research team is whether a vertically integrated, more “closed” approach can sustain leadership versus an “open grid” that standardizes inter-factory integration. On one side, we argue that without open standards and protocols, multicompany business-to-business workflows risk fragmenting into a patchwork of proprietary adapters, repeating early cloud pain and slowing the “intelligence economy.” Trust requirements (transparency, accountability) and the cost of data movement and governance reinforce the case for openness; unified enterprise data will be the gating factor and creates room for data mobility vendors to grab a piece of the market. On the other side, we note that de facto standards have repeatedly led markets – IBM/360, Windows on commodity PCs, AWS primitives, iPhone, CUDA and the like – where proprietary control plus ecosystem gravity created the interoperability that matter in practice. In that view, surviving factories will define interfaces bilaterally and at scale, then formal standards follow. Key assumption: Enterprises will mostly consume AI via APIs; interoperability will improve through a mix of de facto interfaces and selective open standards; unified, governed data is the real prerequisite to value capture. Netting it out, the forecast supports OpenAI as the current favorite in the race. Advantaged by funding, compute access, fast software/API velocity and deep partnerships, we see this compounding into share gains even if the posture is more closed than purists would like. We acknowledge the risk that openness wins the long game; however, history suggests that de facto standards often dominate first, with formal openness catching up later. Our base case therefore keeps OpenAI in the lead, while watching for evidence of durable open protocols that would shift share toward more open operators. The chart below shows our cumulative CapEx forecast required to build AI factories (orange line) and the token revenue from those factories green line. As you can see, this business is not for the faint of heart, as described by the points below. We believe the cumulative-spend vs. cumulative-revenue forecast underscores the AI productivity paradox in that a multitrillion-dollar CapEx wave begins in 2024, but revenue trails for a decade-plus, yielding an early J-curve where measured productivity looks low or even negative. The spend line reflects the full factory build – land, power, water, distribution, thermal and accelerated stacks – while the revenue line captures commercialization that starts slowly and steepens only after end-to-end solutions mature. In our analysis, three inhibitors dominate the early years: 1) Weak data quality – web data is noisy and enterprise data is also challenging – requiring time-consuming cleanup, harmonization and policy controls; 2) The need for the industry to package and ship a unified, trustworthy agentic software layer that enterprises can adopt without bespoke integration; and 3) The sheer denominator problem – so much CapEx goes out up front that catching up takes time even as utilization improves. There is broad agreement that value creation ultimately skyrockets as the operating leverage kicks in; the open question is pace. Some argue the crossover could come sooner for targeted, high-value workflows rather than blanket enterprise adoption, while others maintain that the scale of CapEx alone pushes breakeven out ~11 years. Headwinds we see: Land/power/water constraints; skilled labor and operational cadence; poor/fragmented data and governance; evolving regulations (and geopolitical frictions) that complicate data movement; and the learning curve to stand up agentic control planes. Netting it out, the forecast dovetails with our key takeaways – a large near-term gap, a long breakeven, early J-curve headwinds, heavy physical/operational constraints and a path to compress the gap by securing energy, lifting utilization, tightening fabrics and hardening governed data pipelines. We believe Deloitte’s “Can US infrastructure keep up with the AI economy?” report articulates a central constraint to our thesis: Energy and water availability – and the speed of grid expansion – will set the pace of the buildout. AI racks run hotter and denser than legacy estates, pushing a structural shift from evaporative to liquid/mechanical cooling and forcing operators to site facilities where dual utility feeds are feasible for redundancy. That is driving builds toward inland markets with favorable land and interconnects but limited local talent pools, while creating visible, localized electricity price inflation in the two to three years following large deployments. In the near term, backup generation remains largely diesel and the grid mix still leans on fossil sources; corporate power purchase agreements and new renewables help, but lead times are long. Nuclear is re-entering the conversation as one of the few scalable, round-the-clock options capable of matching multigigawatt AI clusters over the decade. In our view, this energy reality dovetails with the J-curve economics in that even if capital is available, the tempo of power procurement, water rights and cooling retrofits slows time-to-tokens and represents a headwind to revenue realization. The practical takeaway is that breakeven moves with infrastructure, not just silicon. Implications: Operators will prioritize sites with dual-feed capacity and water sources; lock long-dated PPAs while exploring nuclear options; expect localized utility rate pressure; plan for liquid cooling skills and supply chains; treat energy procurement as a first-class program office alongside networking and data governance. The Deloitte study lays out many challenges and solutions to building out AI infrastructure. Perhaps one that is most underappreciated is skilled labor. We believe a key blocker after power is people. Deloitte’s survey shows competition for skilled labor and a shortage of data-center-specific skills as the top workforce challenges. Building and operating AI factories requires niche trades – nuclear engineers, diesel-gen technicians, high-capacity chiller mechanics and specialized welders – not generic information technology staff. These workers are scarce, unevenly distributed and often unwilling to relocate to inland locations where dual-feed power and water are available, pressuring wage inflation and scheduling risk. The data underscores the point in that respondents cite competition with other sectors (~53%), a shortage of data-center–related skilled labor (~51%), geographic limits on talent (~43%), and high turnover (~42%) as primary obstacles. Labor regulation adds friction as well; notably, power-company executives flag regulation as a challenge far more often than data-center builders, reflecting state-by-state and EU-style variability. Against that backdrop, hyperscalers, neoclouds and well-funded operators will pay up for the best people, while governments are also in the hunt – tightening the market further. In our view, solving the talent gap requires a multiyear effort – national and regional programs to retrain displaced workers; vocational pipelines starting in high school for advanced welding, mechanical and electrical trades, fluid engineers that understand advanced plumbing; and increased use of robotics to service multibuilding campuses measured in football fields. Without this workforce ramp, the CapEx-revenue crossover slips, regardless of how fast silicon ships. Satya Nadella made the following statement: So the new SaaS applications, as you rightfully said, are intelligent applications that are optimized for a set of evals and a set of outcomes that then know how to use the token factories output most efficiently. Sometimes latency matters, sometimes performance matters. And knowing how to do that trade in a smart way is where the SaaS application value is. But overall, it is going to be true that there is a real marginal cost to software this time around. It was there in the cloud era too. When we were doing CD-ROMs, there wasn’t much of a marginal cost. With the cloud, there was. And this time around, it’s a lot more. And so therefore, the business models have to adjust and you have to do these optimizations for the agent factory and the token factory separately. AI is shifting the margin math again. The CD-ROM era drove marginal cost toward the price of plastic; SaaS reintroduced a cloud OpEx tax; AI adds the heaviest burden yet – rapidly depreciating GPUs, power and specialized labor – so headline gross margins compress even as volume potential explodes. Those dynamics align with recent comments about marginal cost pressure and sets the stage for what we view as the more important transition – George Gilbert’s service-as-software or SaSo thesis. In SaSo, factories expose agentic capabilities as programmable services, enterprises consume them through APIs and lightweight local runtimes, and the “software-like” economics accrue disproportionately to buyers (productivity) and to a handful of sellers that achieve scale, utilization, and distribution. We see three forces accelerating SaSo despite near-term cost gravity. First, algorithmic and systems efficiency will complement brute-force scaling – better data selection, sparsity, compilation, and workload shaping can cut compute costs materially. Second, distributed AI will split work sensibly: pre- and post-processing at the edge (including on devices) with factory inference and training behind APIs; storage tiers (including tape) and robotics will lower the cost of operating massive campuses. Third, the factories with the deepest ecosystems will ship the systems of intelligence or SoI agentic control planes, software development kits and adapters that enterprises adopt “as-is,” rather than building bespoke stacks. In our view, this means most organizations will prioritize owning and governing their data while sourcing intelligence from a few high-volume factories that improve fastest. Bottom line: The AI factory buildout is real, front-loaded, and subject to a decade-long J-curve. Power, talent and data quality/governance pace the crossover point. Revenue capture accrues to operators that 1) Drive utilization, 2) Win the networking and systems efficiency game, 3) Support the delivery of trustworthy agentic platforms as services, 4) mobilize developer ecosystems, and 5) Relentlessly work the supply chain. Buyers of AI will see software-like marginal economics. That sets up a a winner-takes-most market.

For years, markets saw Amazon and Apple as laggards in the artificial intelligence race dominated by Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Though Amazon had a huge cloud infrastructure through Amazon Web Services (AWS), investors weren’t excited about the company. However, the narrative shifted when the company posted strong September quarter earnings. A deal with OpenAI and a ramp-up in its capital expenditure signalled that Amazon was back in the AI race. AI is just one of Amazon’s many concerns. How it manages its mammoth retail operations amid regulatory pressures matters too. Market catch-upIn the past few years, post-covid and during the AI boom, Amazon was an outlier among the Big Five tech companies, but for the wrong reasons. In the past five years, Amazon shares gained 51%, while its peers doubled or tripled their market value. As Nvidia boomed on the demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoft captured headlines with its OpenAI tie-up, investors were concerned that AWS, a cloud leader and Amazon's key division, was struggling to scale. Amazon was spending heavily on AI infrastructure but was losing share to Microsoft and Google. In the second quarter of 2025, AWS’s profit margins fell sharply. The picture changed after Amazon's third-quarter earnings on 30 October 2025. Results exceeded expectations, and shares jumped 13% in after-hours trading. "There was definitely concern about AWS losing market share to Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud," Argent Capital's Jed Ellerbroek told Reuters. “But now AWS is aboard the train as well." In the past five days, Amazon was the only Big Five stock to post gains, while the others declined. AWS revivalIn the September quarter, AWS reported revenues of $33 billion, up 20.2% from $27.5 billion in Q3 2024. It outpaced the segment's 19% growth in Q3 2024 and exceeded Wall Street's 18.1% forecast. The results lifted AWS’s annualized run rate to $132 billion. During the earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy highlighted that the division was "growing at a pace we haven’t seen since 2022," attributing this to "strong demand in AI and machine learning." It addressed investors’ concerns that AWS—which holds about 31% of global cloud infrastructure, according to recent Synergy Research data—might be struggling to manage scale.

It could also leverage other changes in the market, such as the friction between Microsoft and its long-standing partner OpenAI. Earlier this week, Amazon signed a $38 billion cloud agreement with OpenAI. The deal could increase its $200 billion backlog by about 20% in the fourth quarter, according to BMO Capital Markets. It also gave AWS a clearer path to recover market share lost to Microsoft and Alphabet. Capital pushTo sustain growth, Amazon has to sustain capital spending. In Q3 2025, its capex hit $35.1 billion, or 19.5% of revenue, up from 14.8% in Q4 2024. This ratio has climbed steadily: 16.1% in Q1 2025 and 19.2% in Q2. It raised full-year capital expenditure guidance to about $125 billion, with most of the funds going to AWS data centres that support AI workloads. Spending is expected to rise further in 2026. That level of investment places Amazon among the largest spenders in the technology sector. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure add to financial strain. Throughout its history, Amazon has pursued growth through efficiency, reflected in its founder’s philosophy: Your margin is my opportunity. A substantial share of its budget is directed toward in-house technologies like Trainium chips, reducing reliance on third-party GPUs. Amazon says its own chips provide 30–40% better price-performance than comparable GPUs. Customers like Anthropic are deploying hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips for models like Claude. Adoption is growing, but it still trails Nvidia.

The layoffs, affecting about 14,000 employees, were announced shortly before the earnings release. During the earnings call, Jassy said the cuts were not AI-driven. “If you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers," he said. “Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people doing the actual work. And it can slow you down." While Jassy has emphasized culture, the broader context is a shift toward automation across Amazon’s operations. The company aims to automate 75% of its fulfillment network and has deployed more than one million robots globally. These investments suggest a gradual substitution of capital for labour. Amazon’s workforce totalled 1.56 million in 2024, roughly unchanged from two years earlier despite higher sales and output, but down from 1.6 million in the covid-hit 2021.

The focus is shifting to Whole Foods, where Amazon plans to expand locations and pilot a smaller ‘daily shop’ format designed for urban markets.

The Wall Street Journal reports that the Nasdaq Composite Index was down 3% — making this its worst week since President Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariff plan in April. Tech companies that have otherwise performed well this year were among those hardest hit, with Palantir’s stock price falling 11% this week, Oracle declining by 9%, and Nvidia losing 7%. These drops also come after earnings reports in which Meta and Microsoft indicated that they plan to continue spending heavily on AI (both companies were down about 4%). “Valuations are stretched,” Cresset Capital’s Jack Ablin told the WSJ. “Just the slightest bit of bad news gets exaggerated … and good news is just not enough to move the needle because expectations are already pretty high.” Economic factors like the ongoing government shutdown, declining consumer sentiment, and widespread layoffs are also likely dragging down the stock market. But the less tech-heavy S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average didn’t do quite as badly, with declines of 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively.

Title: Why Sam Altman Won't Be on the Hook for OpenAI's Spending Spree

Over the last few months, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has been on a tear of dealmaking, announcing multibillion dollar agreements with the biggest tech companies in the world. There’s Oracle, Nvidia, Microsoft, AMD, Broadcom, and most recently, Amazon. He’s committed to spending a grand sum total of $1.4 trillion on datacenters in the coming years — an eyebrow-raising figure for a company which claims its annual revenue is projected to reach $20 billion this year, begging an all-important question for the entire tech industry, whose fate is now tied to OpenAI: What happens if he can’t pay? At an event this week, OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar seemed to suggest that the government could act as a “backstop” for the company’s commitments — comments she later walked back. And in a long-winded post on X, Altman addressed the question of what happens to OpenAI if its web of deals falls apart: “If we screw up and can’t fix it, we should fail, and other companies will continue on doing good work and servicing customers,” Altman said. “...We of course could be wrong, and the market—not the government—will deal with it if we are.” The odds don’t look great right now. In order to come through on its compute commitments, OpenAI’s revenue would have to grow to an estimated $577 billion by 2029, roughly the size of Google’s revenue that same year, Tomasz Tunguz, a general partner at Theory Ventures, wrote in a recent blog post. That’s a roughly 2900% jump from its current projections for 2025. But OpenAI has options. One likely scenario is that the AI company pays for and utilizes only a portion of the compute it has booked, said D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria. In that case, companies like Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, CoreWeave and others will most likely renegotiate the contracts and ensure they get at least some amount of business from OpenAI, especially if the alternative is getting none at all. “They don't want OpenAI to go bankrupt, so their incentive is to renegotiate,” he told Forbes. “He’s taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” Renegotiating contracts isn’t uncommon in the data center world. These contracts are extremely complex and often spread out over a span of years; some parties can even further extend timelines in case companies aren’t able to meet commitments. Clients like OpenAI are typically billed on the basis of usage. The “big numbers” being announced are often larger than what’s actually committed under contract, largely due to variables like share price, data center construction cost and GPU price, data center expert Daniel Golding said. For instance, OpenAI has committed to buy up to 6 GW of AMD’s chips (estimated to be worth around $90 billion) in exchange for about 10% of AMD shares—no cash on either side. But that hinges on performance milestones for OpenAI’s technology and commercial business as well as AMD’s share price. The contracts often have some capital I ifs. Thanks to constraints on power supply and chip availability, there’s a possibility that some of these infrastructure providers aren’t able to deliver in time, another opportunity for OpenAI to weasel out of paying some of the top line number. OpenAI’s $22.4 billion in total contracts with CoreWeave, for instance, can be terminated by either party at any time “for cause” (legal speak for things like delays). But even with about a trillion dollars on the line, the bigger risk in Altman’s mind is not having access to enough cheap compute to train and run better AI models when the time comes— a move that is crucial for revenue growth. “We believe the risk to OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” he said, adding that the company is also exploring ways to sell compute to other companies directly, much like CoreWeave does. When reached for comment, OpenAI spokesperson Steve Sharpe said the company has “nothing to add.” Altman’s fixation on grabbing as much gargantuan compute as he can is not surprising. He has always knelt at the altar of scaling laws. Earlier this year, Altman mused on the coming of AGI, or artificial general intelligence, the company’s overarching goal of creating AI that matches or surpasses human capabilities. “The intelligence of an AI model roughly equals the log of the resources used to train and run it,” he wrote, noting you could get “continuous and predictable gains” from pumping money into those resources. “The scaling laws that predict this are accurate over many orders of magnitude,” he wrote. Even before ChatGPT was released, he told employees at his crypto-cum-identity company Worldcoin (now called World), that one of his personal operating principles is “scale it up and see what happens,” something he’s found effective with everything from large neural networks to fusion reactors, Forbes reported. And the faster the better. Scaling up “earlier than it makes sense to … is super, super valuable,” he told Worldcoin employees. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them.’” Experts note chief dealmaker Altman doesn’t have anything to lose. He has repeatedly claimed he does not have a stake in the company, and won’t have a stake even after OpenAI has restructured to become a public benefit corporation. “He has the upside, in a sense, in terms of influence, if it all succeeds,” said Ofer Eldar, a corporate governance professor at the UC Berkeley School of Law. “He's taking all this commitment knowing that he's not going to actually face any consequences because he doesn't have a financial stake.” That’s not good corporate governance, according to Jo-Ellen Pozner, a professor of management and entrepreneurship at Santa Clara University’s Leavey School of Business. “We allow leaders that we see as being super pioneering to behave idiosyncratically, and when things move in the opposite direction and somebody has to pay, it's unclear that they're the ones that are going to have to pay,” she said. Luria adds: “He can commit to as much as he wants. He can commit to a trillion dollars, ten trillion, a hundred trillion dollars. It doesn't matter. Either he uses it, he renegotiates it, or he walks away.” There are of course more indirect stakes for Altman, experts said, like the reputational blow he’d take if the deals fall apart. But on paper, he’d seemingly be off the hook, they said. As OpenAI has grown in prominence, tech giants have clamored to strike deals with the AI behemoth. “More of the world wants to work with us, so deals are quicker to negotiate,” Altman said recently. And they’ve reaped the upsides: Oracle, Nvidia, AMD and Broadcom gained a collective $636 billion in market cap on the days their deals were announced. Most recently, when OpenAI announced a $38 billion AI infrastructure deal with Amazon on Monday, the company’s stock increased 4%, adding $10 billion to Jeff Bezos’ net worth. “The math that Mr. Altman is doing in his head is ‘they need me more than I need them,’” Luria said. Companies involved in these circular deals have already indicated they’re willing to bail each other out. In September, Nvidia said it would buy CoreWeave’s unsold computing capacity through 2032, initially worth $6.3 billion. Presumably, that could expand to include anything OpenAI doesn’t use given that it’s CoreWeave’s largest customer. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank,” said Lloyd Walmsley, a Mizuho analyst who covers Meta, Google and Amazon. “ Everyone's holding hands and, and having this leap of faith that the products are so powerful.” It’s also possible that OpenAI uses all the compute it has booked, and needs more. In that case, the AI titan will need to raise more funding—either through private or public markets—and increase its revenue exponentially. Part of why Altman has spoken about a potential OpenAI IPO is that it would make raising cheaper debt much easier. Altman said on Thursday that he’s confident that revenue will continue to grow, primarily from upcoming enterprise products and categories like robotics and consumer devices. Then, take the extreme case. If OpenAI were to file for bankruptcy protection, who would get paid first? Who would, in Sam Altman’s words, “get burnt”? For one, it’s entirely possible that some cash-rich company, perhaps one on the other end of one of its big contracts like Microsoft or Oracle, buys it in a fire sale. In the very unlikely event OpenAI goes bankrupt and liquidates instead, debtholders would get their money back first. Then equity investors, and finally—if there’s anything left over—common shareholders. OpenAI has only announced one debt deal so far, a $4 billion credit facility with nine banks including JPMorgan, Citi, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The company announced the loan in October 2024 and said it is a revolving credit facility (akin to a giant corporate credit card). It’s unclear if OpenAI has additional debt, which it isn’t required to disclose as a private company. “If you owe the bank a hundred thousand dollars, the bank owns you. If you owe the bank a hundred million dollars, you own the bank.” King among OpenAI’s equity holders is Microsoft, which owns 27% of the company following OpenAI’s restructuring as a for-profit company last week. Microsoft has invested $11.6 billion of its $13 billion commitment to OpenAI, and OpenAI has committed to purchase $250 billion of Microsoft Azure’s compute services over the coming years. The companies have two-way plans to share revenue. “Of the dominoes that are going to fall when OpenAI can't pay everybody [and the question arises of] who gets paid first, and I'd argue that Microsoft gets paid first,” Luria added. Other large shareholders include Thrive, SoftBank, Dragoneer and investors in the $6 billion merger between Jony Ive’s io and OpenAI. Common shareholders—employees, cofounders and the nonprofit—would get what’s left, proportionally to how much they paid for their shares. Interestingly, OpenAI’s nonprofit holds a special “Class N” common share, which gives it majority voting and veto power in elections of board directors, though that share isn’t entitled to any financial return if the company were to go under. (The nonprofit’s 26% stake likely also includes ordinary common shares.) Altman’s wheeling and dealing is nothing short of mind-boggling, though many of the biggest payments aren’t due for a few years. In the AI universe, that’s plenty of time to figure out how he’s going to pay for it all, whether it’s additional fundraising or explosive revenue growth. Seems like nobody knows the answer just yet, not even him.

Find out more about how we test. $599.99. That's how much the latest effort from SteelSeries will set you back. And it's a price tag that's impossible to overlook. This is the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite. It joins other products that share the "Elite" branding, such as the Xbox Elite Controller, targeting users on the high end. Gamers span all sorts of purchasing power capabilities these days, and companies know it. For those with cash to burn, building products that can seemingly do everything while also sporting the most premium materials is a segment manufacturers are increasingly targeting. The Arctis Nova Elite unashamedly joins that market as the best Xbox headset for pure, decadent luxury. As a humble games blogger, I'm not sure there's a universe where I would (or even could) ever pay $599.99 for a headset, practically under any circumstances — but if I could afford it, it would absolutely be for this headset. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is undeniably the most luxurious gaming headset I have ever used, whose features and quality inarguably justify that sky-high price tag. But you're going to be a very specific type of gamer to want to buy in here. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by SteelSeries. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. For over a decade, I've been reviewing headsets of all shapes and sizes. I've tried earbuds, budget gaming headsets, and premium cans for enthusiasts. I keep all of the headsets I review for active comparisons, and could probably open my own headset store if this tech blogging lark ever folds. One thing that won't fold is my enthusiasm for recommending YOU the best Xbox and PC headsets for your use cases. As for this headset, I've also been using the previous Arctis Nova as my daily driver. How does this one compare? Read on. You know the price already. It's a beefy boy, but what about the specs to match it? Let's take a look. This is premium from every angle you look. This is a hi-res certified headset, which means it's verified by independent organizations as being able to deliver sound beyond a typical CD. This is 24-bit/96 kHz signals specifically, and to do that, requires a higher grade of engineering and materials. As far as I could tell, this is the first wireless gaming headset to achieve this standard — a level typically reserved for audiophile products and studio-grade gear. Category Arctis Nova Pro Elite Drivers 40mm carbon fiber drivers with brass surrounds Frequency response 10 Hz – 40 kHz (Hi-Res certified) Connectivity Dual USB-C, 2.4 GHz wireless, 3.5mm line-in, Bluetooth Microphone Retractable and beamforming internal retracted modes Battery system Dual hot-swappable batteries (30~ hours x2) Build materials Steel headband, aluminum hinges, premium leatherette cushions Weight ~350 g Compatibility PC, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Xbox (via DAC), mobile (via Bluetooth) Special features Hi-Res Wireless certification, AI mic noise reduction, EQ software, ANC options, full DAC with multi-platform connectivity, simultaneous audio source mixing Price (RRP) $559.99 USD It's not all about hi-res certification here, though. While premium materials definitely had a role to play here, this headset also boasts some of the most impressive versatility we've ever seen in a gaming headset. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. The Arctis Nova Elite's powerful digital audio controller looks unassuming on your desk, but it boasts monstrous capabilities. It's your platform for hot-swapping and keeping batteries charged up (with each of the 2 included cells offering up to 30 hours of playback). It also lets you mix audio signals from four different sources: two USB-C, one 3.5mm line-in, and one Bluetooth 5.3. This is the first headset that has offered the ability to mix Xbox, PS5, and PC audio simultaneously since SPDIF fell out of fashion as a result — something game streamers using consoles and capture cards might appreciate. Even the packaging is premium here, as SteelSeries guns for the audiophile and enthusiast gamer segment. It's as expensive as some Xbox Series X and PS5 models at $599.99, and it seems to have good stock levels across the board as of writing. Does the Arctis Nova Elite stick the landing? Absolutely yes, in (almost) every regard. And luckily, the parts that could be improved are software in nature and can be updated. Here are more details on the experience. When I opened up the package to this headset, I immediately knew I was about to experience something special. This is by far and away the most expensive headset I have ever reviewed, and its premium presentation will immediately command your attention. The packaging is accented in gold and comes in a sort of monolithic box as if it had descended from another planet. The Arctis Nova Elite sports a familiar design if you've seen the predecessor Arctis Nova Pro (my previous primary driver here), complete with a retractable mic, detachable magnetic side-plates housing USB-C connectivity and the battery bay, as well as a floating headband. What sets it apart is that every aspect of it is dialled up to 11. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The dials, buttons, and materials all sport a very luxurious feel. Various parts of the headset that were plastic in other models are now metal, including the textured volume dial and adjustable hinges on either side. The leatherette earcups feel incredibly comfortable, and dare I say, dreamy on the skin, easily defeating fabric-clad rivals. The floating headband is also an easy win for long, long periods of use, and retains SteelSeries' tradition for cranial comfort. One weird downside of the floating headband is that it's easy to rock the headset off your head if you get a little too immersed in the music (and immersed you will, the sound delivery on this headset is immense). It's designed for long gaming sessions at the end of the day, but it's worth being aware of. Returning is the retractable boom microphone, which now cleverly has per-configuration settings. When you retract it, you can still use it for calls, and it'll beamform your voice similar to earbuds. When you extend it, it functions as a high-quality mic for comms and potentially even light content creation. I'm not sure I'd record a full YouTube video on this mic over my Elgato XLR, but it's up there with the best gaming headset mics I've used. Indeed, the ability to retract the mic and fall back to Bluetooth 5.3 gives you lifestyle usability here that many other "gaming" headsets don't really offer. The subtle design on the black model means it won't look out of place when used during commutes or on a plane, and there's even an alternative colorway that fits a more Apple-style grey fashion aesthetic, too. The only criticism I'd offer here from a "lifestyle" perspective is that, perhaps, the logos are a bit "loud" for this type of use case. There are after-market sideplates you can buy that look a little more subtle, though, or even louder ones if you prefer. The World of Warcraft Horde ones are out of stock, though (dang.) Also, the soft-touch plastics SteelSeries opted for here tend to be fingerprint magnets too, which isn't a big deal, but on the black model, it can be pretty noticeable. When you're knee deep in corpses in a Battlefield 6 map or rocking to Nirvana while writing a gaming headset review on the internet (meta), you're likely not thinking about the side plates or fingerprints, though. How's the audio? It's fan-expletive-tastic. Let's not beat around the bush here. The Arctis Nova Elite is the most immaculate audio experience I've had in over a decade of gaming headset reviews. I put them directly head-to-head with a family member's studio-grade Beyerdynamic DT 1990 PRO and was quite stunned to find the experience pleasantly comparable. This is a gaming headset, but I've found myself using it primarily for music over the past few weeks. Rediscovering new details in soundscapes I know very well has been incredibly fun with this product, as someone who generally uses earbuds or other random gaming headsets for music typically. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. There's no distortion, no glitching, no artifacting, no muddiness, no range is overbearing or under-represented — it's simply hard to go back to anything else after using these. ANC helps eliminate background noise on planes, trains, and buses, and easy on-ear controls and a solid mobile app make them a winner for commuters. Indeed, you have multiple ways to connect to this headset, too. As noted, the digital audio controller will sit at your desk and politely allow you to connect up not one, but actually three sound sources, on top of a fourth Bluetooth signal directly into the headset. And yes, you can mix them all simultaneously. No other headset I've used allows for this absurd level of versatility and freedom. The vast majority of users won't need this, but as a game streamer that uses a laptop and an Xbox with a capture card, I've found it incredibly welcome to not need to Bluetooth to my TV to get game audio (but you can still do that if you want?!). The headset is heavily configurable, too. The Steelseries GG software on PC and mobile devices allows you to load up from a huge array of presets for various games, more so than any other headset I've tried. Even obscure games are represented here, which is impressive. The only downside is that you can't really delete any of the presets, nor favorite the ones you prefer. It can be a pain going back and forward between a gaming preset and a music preset, for example — but it's easily fixable. The software on PC in general could use a variety of improvements, as it sometimes hangs and features app downloads and things most people are doubtlessly unlikely to use (why would I need to download Discord from SteelSeries?). But, this is quite honestly my only gripe with the feature set, and thankfully, software is a comparably easy fix over a hardware flaw. This headset has no hardware flaws. The first iteration of the Arctis Nova Pro had a protrusion in the left ear that could get uncomfortable across long sessions, for example, but there's no such issue here. Maximum comfort, with maximum longevity, and superb, immaculate audio. For gaming, the SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite continues to excel. Games like Battlefield 6 and Overwatch absolutely sing on this device, giving away enemy positions with powerful tactical awareness, all without detracting from the more immersive sound design of the various virtual warzones we inhabit. The amount of tweaking you can do is impressive, too. Pushed to its extremes, the bass can get obnoxiously punchy if you want it to, or leave it thick and creamy, all while retaining maximum clarity and separation. Instruments sound like real instruments on this headset, which might sound like an odd thing to say — but you really feel the physicality of a kick drum or the slide of a bass string in this soundscape. Imagine how that translates to games with high-quality audio design, with explosions and gunfire zipping all around you. It's difficult to compare this to other gaming headsets as a result. The Arctis Nova Elite is just sublime. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The microphone experience is good, too. As you can hear in the clip above, you're looking at crystal clear comms with the microphone extended, and very good call quality when it's retracted. You can set per-config sidetone too. The sidetone quality isn't the best, but it's more than adequate for game comms. All up, it's hard to find things to gripe about here. I wish the apps were a little less bloated and more focused, but it doesn't impact the sound experience. The number of settings you can alter and control is intuitive to set up and access, even if the software itself can be a bit slow at times. And hey, it can (and will) be updated. This headset is an absolute winner, but ... it's hard to look past that price point. There's pretty much no other headset that competes with the Arctis Nova Elite. On pure audio alone, the Arctis Nova Elite stands out in its own class and is more closely comparable to other hi-res headsets that typically don't fall into the gaming category. The only other headset with this kind of wireless versatility is the Astro A50 (2025), and the Arctis Nova Elite has it utterly beaten on raw audio, comfort, and lifestyle versatility. The Astro A50 is a pure gaming headset, though, and shaves $300 off the asking price to boot. I think, unless you were planning to use this headset everywhere and anywhere as a lifestyle option, you might get more bang for your buck with the similarly versatile Astro A50 ... but you wouldn't get the sound quality, multi-USB source mixing, or hot-swappable batteries. There's simply no real comparison here. The Arctis Nova Elite is well and truly in a category of its own. The Arctis Nova Elite is the ultimate gaming headset. It's the ultimate everything headset, frankly, able to easily accommodate high-end gaming, multi-device mixing for content creation, and day-to-day lifestyle use with ANC and Bluetooth. Its hi-res certification isn't just a sticker; it's immediately recognizable the second you commit a current to this headset. The sound reproduction puts the Arctis Nova Elite thoroughly in a category of its own, with few, if any, comparable peers. But boy howdy, it ain't cheap. You're going to either need to be a true all-day audio enthusiast, particularly fiscally affluent, or (like me) a poor financial planner to justify buying this. In my headset reviews, I tend to put a big emphasis on value for "most" people. Most of us are unlikely to look at a $599.99 headset and ever consider it an option — myself included. But with this, hearing is believing. It's one of the best headsets around. I've used my Arctis Nova Pro as my "daily" headset for several years at this point, and aside from some cushion wear, it's as good as it was the day I got it (and the cushions are easily replaced, too). If you were planning to use this headset for years and years, I think even the more budget-conscious could consider this headset, particularly if you wanted something you could use everywhere and anywhere. At the same time, would you feel comfy taking a $599.99 headset on the subway in that situation? I'm not sure I would. This headset is targeting a very specific type of customer unashamedly, and given what it offers, it's hard to penalize it for its price tag alone. The price makes sense given what's on offer. Whether or not it makes sense for your budget entirely depends on you and your needs. One thing I do know is you absolutely will not be disappointed. The SteelSeries Arctis Nova Elite is a best-in-class headset boasting supreme versatility, comfort, audio, and specs. It also boasts a supreme price tag, shrugging off affordability for maximum features and luxury. You're either going to really want all of its features or have cash to burn to justify this headset, but either way, you won't be disappointed.

Title: Data-center operator CoreWeave is a stock-market darling. Bears see its finances as emblematic of an AI infrastructure bubble

Time Published: 2025-11-08T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
Jeremy Kahn is the AI editor at Fortune, spearheading the publication's coverage of artificial intelligence. He also co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. Leo Schwartz is a senior writer at Fortune covering fintech, crypto, venture capital, and financial regulation. A vast data center in Plano, Texas, is a symbol of the enormous AI infrastructure boom that has boosted stock markets and driven U.S. economic growth over the past year. The data center occupies more than 450,000 square feet and cost $1.6 billion to construct and equip. It supplies 30 megawatts of computing power to train and run AI models. Yet the company that runs it is a leading candidate to be ground-zero for a future AI financial meltdown. The data center is one of dozens around the world operated by CoreWeave, a company that develops and manages data centers and sells their computing capacity to technology companies. Its business is at the center of the AI economy—providing computing power to meet the voracious demand of the likes of Microsoft and OpenAI. But CoreWeave doesn’t own the Plano facility, nor does it own most of the data hubs it’s operating. And that is a part of the problem. The company is built, by its own admission, on a mountain of debt—obligations it has piled up as it races to build out a network of server farms for its customers. And that mountain looms far larger than the piles of cash that CoreWeave has brought in the door so far. When the company announces earnings on Monday, bulls and bears alike will be watching to see how its revenue is growing, and whether it has been able to pare its losses. CoreWeave’s earnings are likely to be a bellwether for the state of the entire AI boom, and for the industry’s massive and expensive infrastructure buildout in particular. CoreWeave has $7.6 billion in current liabilities—bills that fall due within 12 months—on its balance sheet, and $11 billion in debt overall, according to its most recent quarterly earnings report, filed in August. Coming from a tech giant like Google or Microsoft with tens of billions in free cash flow, such numbers wouldn’t raise an eyebrow. But CoreWeave’s revenues were only $1.9 billion in 2024. On its Q2 earnings call, CEO Michael Intrator told analysts that full year 2025 revenue would land between $5.15 billion to $5.35 billion. On the same call, the CEO said he expected CoreWeave’s capex for the year would total between $20 billion and $23 billion. Those short-term figures pale beside a bigger and potentially more onerous obligation that isn’t on its balance sheet: the $34 billion in scheduled lease payments that will start kicking in between now and 2028. Many of those payments are stretched over relatively long terms, of 10 years or more. Still, some of this is for data centers and office buildings that have not yet begun to operate or bring in revenue—representing a vulnerability if any of the as-yet-unprofitable startups CoreWeave sells computing services to are unable to meet their contractual obligations, or if construction delays mean CoreWeave is not able to provide capacity on time, allowing customers to cancel contracts. In a sense, Coreweave is a metaphor for the broader AI industry at the present moment, as top companies commit to enormous capex spending today in the confidence that it’ll be justified by future revenue from AI platforms and services. Investors appear to be broadly convinced by the company’s narrative: CoreWeave’s stock price is up 160% since the company’s IPO in March. But Fortune’s analysis of CoreWeave’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are laced with warnings and caveats, show how risky the company’s business model could be. In interviews with several analysts, bulls and bears agreed that CoreWeave’s fundamentals, as reflected in its filings, don’t currently add up. “A lot has to go right,” says Thomas Blakey, a managing director of software equity research at Cantor Fitzgerald, who rates CoreWeave “overweight.” (Of 26 equity analysts who currently cover the stock, 14 had the equivalent of buy or outperform ratings on the shares, while nine had “hold” ratings, and three had “underperform” or “sell” recommendations, according to data from S&P Market Intelligence.) The bears see CoreWeave as a strong candidate to find itself underwater with its mounting liabilities, making it potentially the first domino to fall in the AI ecosystem. “To say they’ll scale out of this is questionable,” says Gil Luria, the head of technology research at the investment firm D.A. Davidson. “I don’t see how it becomes more profitable.” He believes that the likeliest outcome for CoreWeave on a five-year time horizon is bankruptcy—either because its current customers will be able to rely on their own infrastructure by then, or because an increasingly stretched CoreWeave will no longer be able to borrow. In a statement to Fortune, a company spokesperson said that “CoreWeave’s capital structure and financial performance are strong and underpinned by long-term take-or-pay contracts signed with the world’s leading enterprises and AI labs who partner with CoreWeave because we deliver the best AI cloud.” The statement went on to say that the company structured its contracts to “support and repay any related debt obligations while generating additional free cash flow. CoreWeave operates in a supply-constrained market where demand far exceeds capacity, and our hyper-growth is evidence of the trust leading companies place in us to power their most critical AI workloads.” With the company continuing to make huge new spending commitments even as it books new future revenue, AI investors’ attention will be glued to its upcoming quarterly earnings report. One number that everyone will be watching is CoreWeave’s “remaining performance obligations,” or RPOs—essentially revenues that CoreWeave has booked but that have not yet been paid. (Like its scheduled lease payments, CoreWeave’s RPOs are excluded from its balance sheet.) If CoreWeave is booking the kinds of contracts that will pull it out of debt sooner rather than later, the RPOs level—and the forecast for how quickly those future bookings are likely to turn into actual cash—are where they would show up. The company has announced several major new deals since its last quarterly earnings announcement, including a $14.2 billion agreement to supply Meta with computing capacity, and an pact with AI startup Poolside for a data center stuffed with 40,000 Nvidia GPUs. So it is likely its RPO total will climb significantly. Wall Street analysts’ forecasts for the company’s 2026 revenue range from $10.9 billion to $14.9 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.Bulls argue that this is exactly how the boom will play out in CoreWeave’s favor: The revenue will come through, in great quantity, and its scale will solve the company’s problems by catching up with and then outpacing its capital expenditures. In that scenario, the company becomes the next Levi Strauss or Amazon Web Services, providing the “picks and shovels” of the AI boom, and getting filthy rich. “The potential is beyond the scope of our imagination at this point,” says Kevin Dede, a senior technology analyst at the financial services firm H.C. Wainwright, which rates CoreWeave a “buy.” But for now CoreWeave is miles away from being profitable and is bleeding cash, absent its ability to issue debt. The RPOs it reported in its most recent earnings that are likely to be realized in the next 12 months are not, on their own, sufficient to cover its current obligations and announced growth plans (more on that shortly). The company has razor-thin operating margins—1.6% in the past quarter. After accounting for its large interest expenses, those margins turn sharply negative. The company lost more than $600 million on $2.2 billion in revenue in the first six months of 2025. “That’s not great,” Luria says. “Is there any way that gap closes?”Barring an enormous surge in revenue over the next 12 months or so, the company will likely need to borrow more money, or renegotiate with creditors, in order to cover the obligations already on its books. To be sure, the AI boom could deliver that revenue surge—but even slight weakening in spending growth across the industry could hit CoreWeave disproportionately. Kerrisdale Capital, an investment management firm that is shorting the stock, is pithy in its conclusions: CoreWeave, it wrote in a September report, is “the poster child of the AI infrastructure bubble.” CoreWeave began as a crypto-mining company, a side project of a few friends who were hedge-fund traders. Crypto mining, like AI, relies heavily on graphic processing units, or GPUs, with the chips racing to solve complicated algorithms that spit out currency rewards for correctly verifying blockchain transactions, and CoreWeave was a steady buyer. Over time, Brian Venturo, one of the company’s founders, realized that the rise in AI would be a major factor fueling the surge in demand for the computing power of the GPUs that CoreWeave was already accumulating. Beginning in October 2021, CoreWeave entered into two deals with asset management firm Magnetar Capital, raising first $50 million in convertible notes, and then a year later, an additional $125 million, also in convertible notes. The company used nearly all of it to buy GPUs from Nvidia. Over the next few years, CoreWeave would secure billions of dollars in a combination of debt and equity, building out a sprawling array of data centers across the U.S., and eventually expanding to the U.K. This March, CoreWeave’s IPO made it one of the closest things to a pure-play AI company to debut on public markets. Initially, fears about the company’s debt load restrained its stock’s performance. But its shares took off in May after it reported its first quarterly earnings, including soaring revenue growth of 420% quarter-on-quarter. While the price has declined since a peak in June, CoreWeave shares closed on Friday at $104, up from a debut of $40. But as Luria puts it, the bear case for CoreWeave is simple math. The company’s business model is to borrow capital and then use that capital to build data centers filled with GPUs and then sell time on those GPUs to AI companies. “The question is, are they getting a sufficient return … on their investment to justify the interest they’re paying on their debt?” Luria says. Its most recent filings show how hefty that debt has become. The problem isn’t just the amount of CoreWeave’s debt. It’s the structure—most of it is more expensive than average for corporate debt, and much of it comes due in the next nine months. Of CoreWeave’s current liabilities, $3.6 billion is debt payable by June 30, 2026, just part of $11 billion in overall debt the company carries on its balance sheet. Much of that debt carries hefty interest rates of between 9% and 15%, according to the financial statements, with 11% being the weighted average rate overall. (This fall, rates on newly issued investment-grade corporate debt have hovered between 5.5% and 6%, according to Moody’s. The rate at which CoreWeave is able to borrow has come down over time, with most of its newer debt issued at closer to 9%. ) The majority of CoreWeave’s outstanding debt, its statements show, is in the form of two loans, called Delayed Draw Term Loan (DDTL)1.0 and DDTL 2.0. There is $1.8 billion outstanding on the DDTL 1.0, at a 15% interest rate, and $5 billion in DDTL 2.0, at an 11% interest rate. The company has begun payment on DDTL 1.0; quarterly principal payments on DDTL 2.0 are due beginning in January 2026. (The interest rates on both these loans are floating.) This is where the company’s RPOs come in. CoreWeave says that as of June 30 it had a little over $30 billion, the majority of which should turn into actual sales over the next four years. The company says 50% of that amount, or $15 billion, will be recognized in the next two years. Wall Street consensus forecasts are that the company’s revenues will be about $12 billion for next year. But if its operating margins remain at just 1.6%, the company will only generate $192 million in income from this revenue—not enough to cover its interest expenses or make the principal repayments on its debt. That implies that CoreWeave’s returns remain far below the cost of its capital. Higher RPOs, of course, would mean more revenue for CoreWeave next year. That said, there are also far more capital expenses to come. CoreWeave continues to spend heavily to purchase Nvidia GPUs—which make up the great majority of its capital expenditures—and other equipment to outfit its data centers. In the first half of 2025, for example, it invested $4.7 billion in property, plant and equipment while bringing in only $2.2 billion in revenue. The report from Kerrisdale cites similar concerns as Luria in justifying its short position. CoreWeave is “a debt-fueled GPU rental business with no moat, dressed up as innovation,” the firm writes, arguing that the stock faces a 90% downside. Luria and Kerrisdale both cite CoreWeave’s highly concentrated customer base as another potential peril—a reality that CoreWeave itself acknowledged in its last earnings report. “A substantial portion of our revenue is driven by a limited number of our customers, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in, spend from one or a few of our top customers would adversely affect our business,” the company wrote. Most notably: In the second quarter of 2025, an eye-popping 71% of CoreWeave’s revenue came from Microsoft alone. To be sure, Microsoft has a better credit rating than many countries, including the United States, and is unlikely to renege on its contract with CoreWeave. And CoreWeave’s contracts with its lessees generally require them to pay to the ends of their leases even if they don’t wind up utilizing them, except in case of “nonperformance.” Much of CoreWeave’s utility has come from offering readily available compute as those companies raced to scale up their own operations. But with Microsoft set to spend tens of billions of dollars on developing its own data centers, it may not need CoreWeave’s services in the future. “They will pay their obligations, but the likelihood of them renewing at the end of the contract is much less guaranteed,” Luria says. CoreWeave’s other major customer, OpenAI, is another matter. In March, CoreWeave entered an agreement with Sam Altman’s AI giant, with OpenAI committed to paying $11.9 billion through October 2030, with a $4 billion expansion announced in May. But OpenAI itself has made commitments far beyond its current cash flow—including commitments in the many hundreds of billions to Oracle, Nvidia and other data center providers. If OpenAI runs into any financial troubles, Luria says, CoreWeave likely wouldn’t be first to receive payments, compared to much larger OpenAI partners like Microsoft, Amazon, or even Oracle. (That’s also the case for some of the other, smaller venture-backed and loss-making AI startups CoreWeave serves, such as poolside, Cohere, and Mistral.) To rely on CoreWeave’s ties to OpenAI, he says, “You have to believe that OpenAI is going to be unbelievably successful, so much so that it can pay everybody that’s ahead in line.” All of this means there’ll be plenty at stake when CoreWeave reports earnings on Monday. The company will also be digesting a recent setback: In late October, the shareholders of Core Scientific, a crypto miner with a hoard of computing resources that CoreWeave coveted, rejected CoreWeave’s $9 billion all-stock acquisition offer. (CoreWeave will console itself with a $270 million breakup fee—an amount that will help it cover the $360 million it is expected to pay Core Scientific to lease data center capacity from it next year. Overall, CoreWeave is on the hook to pay Core Scientific some $10 billion in future lease payments over the next 12 years, which may have been one reason CoreWeave was eager to try to use its highly-valued shares to purchase Core Scientific in an all-equity deal valued at $9 billion when the offer was initially made.) The argument for CoreWeave’s success is just as simple as the math against it: AI is going to represent a transformational shift in the global economy, and CoreWeave is powering the technology’s growth. As the development of AI accelerates, so will the demand for computing power from companies aside from the hyperscalers, all hungry for the services of providers like CoreWeave. What’s more, today’s creditors may be willing to wait a little longer for that demand to materialize: The lenders behind DDTL 2.0 recently renegotiated the terms of the loan to delay the start of principal payments. Blakey, at Cantor Fitzgerald, says that CoreWeave is already diversifying its customer base, noting the recent deal with Meta. “It’s a growth business,” he says, in reference to CoreWeave’s capital expenditures. “If business is growing, you have to invest against it.” He and other bulls see a future where the company is no longer laden with debt. Once CoreWeave sheds its liabilities over the next five years, Blakey says, a growing percent of its revenue can begin coming from infrastructure that’s already paid off, boosting CoreWeave’s margins. Moreover, Blakey says that new models of chips might run more efficiently or be able to fetch a higher premium from customers, allowing CoreWeave to hold more pricing power. Blakey says that those $30.1 billion in RPOs—the revenue that has been booked but not yet delivered—are likely to increase meaningfully in CoreWeave’s next earnings, based on recently announced agreements. But the number to watch might be the additional obligations in borrowing that the company will take on to service them: If those obligations scale up alongside the booked revenue, bears say, CoreWeave still risks running out of cash unless it takes on yet more debt, raises more equity, or gets existing creditors to extend terms. Blakey acknowledges that a sustainable path forward for CoreWeave is perilous. “A lot has to go right,” he says. Still, he compares the current moment in AI to the beginning of the smartphone era, where analysts doubted Apple’s claims that it would transform global communication. “CoreWeave is a leader there in terms of this market,” Blakely says. “If they can maintain that lead … they will be able to participate in the spoils.” CORRECTIONS: An earlier version of this story stated incorrectly that Coreweave’s quarterly principal payments for DDTL 1.0 would begin in January 2026; those payments have already begun. The original version also misspelled the surname of Thomas Blakey. This article was updated to add a range of analysts’ projections for CoreWeave’s 2026 revenue. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: It’s not a bubble, because AI is already running the markets

AI isn’t a bubble. It’s already reshaping markets. Autonomous AI agents now drive trading, outperforming humans and rewriting how money moves. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World While the world debates whether AI is the next dot-com bubble, chasing valuations rather than implications, they’re missing the underlying innovation story. The same AI infrastructure fueling trillion-dollar bets is already rewriting how money moves. AI is no longer an investment theme. It’s the market itself. What few noticed is that the same AI infrastructure driving the headlines is already reshaping the markets from within. The invisible battle happening behind the candlesticks isn’t bulls and bears anymore; it’s between self-learning AIs that never sleep. Markets aren’t just humans using algorithms. They’re autonomous swarms fighting for milliseconds. Agents watch every market 24/7, spotting risks, debating strategies and executing without hesitation. Recent breakthroughs in AI and blockchain acceptance have created the perfect conditions for agentic markets to flourish. AI provides cognition; meanwhile, blockchain supplies trust, verification and payment rails. This offers the medium for AI agents to transact, prove, and exchange value freely. AI has crossed the chasm from stock picker to near-autonomous day trader. It learns and acts faster than any human. It spots what humans miss, predicts the move before it happens and never second-guesses itself. It’s the ultimate insider, without inflaming the SEC. It’s early days for agentic AI in trading, but make no mistake — it’s here and already moving the markets while most traders sleep. During the biggest crypto flash crash on Oct. 10, while the rest of the crypto market was in freefall, AI agents did the opposite. They stayed calm, shorted the chaos, and ended the week up 40%. They gave us a glimpse into the future of markets. One where the AI agents don’t just follow code, they respond like real traders. Some cut risk instantly. Others waited for confirmation. A few leaned into the drawdown. What’s striking is not just the gains, it’s the composure. Each AI agent made its own independent decisions, yet collectively, they converged on profitable outcomes. That’s the essence of agentic intelligence, autonomous systems learning to interpret chaos as opportunity. Companies describe similar behavior within trading desks, where agentic systems parse live data from public disclosures and feed execution layers in real-time. Over time, agents evolve from code to cognition. Autonomous systems that read markets, understand intent and execute strategies on their own. Acting like a digital hive mind, adjusting logic mid-session as markets shift around them. For years, quant funds and high-frequency traders have pitted humans plus algorithms against the market. Enter AI versus AI. Self-directed systems plan, reason and execute around the clock. What’s emerging is a battlefield of AIs — institutional, retail, and synthetic — talking to each other in real-time. When AI trades with AI, human intent disappears. Prices move on machine-to-machine negotiations, not emotion or fundamentals. The market begins to trade itself. Related: AI gives retail investors a way out of the diversification trap A majority of global trading volume now runs through algorithmic systems, estimates ranging from 60% to 89%, depending on the market. Within months, Symphony’s agentic trading layer was clearing $140 million in transactions, working with 15 of the world’s biggest financial institutions to test self-learning yield and execution agents. For decades, investing was about finding an edge. AI gives retail investors that power for the first time. Retail traders can soon deploy the same logic once reserved for billion-dollar funds. Swarm intelligence that scans arbitrage, simulates momentum, hedges risk and executes collaboratively. It’s the retail equivalent of a hedge fund in your pocket. The walls between institutional and retail finance are eroding. AI makes the 1%’s playbook accessible to the 99%. The next outperformers will deploy agentic swarms, rather than tracking indexes. AI versus AI warfare will define liquidity, volatility and price discovery. Humans will still set direction, risk tolerance and capital allocation, but won’t press the buttons. Markets will begin to self-trade in swarms of autonomous participants. Power will shift to whomever fine-tunes the feedback loops. When agents detect each other’s footprints, they’ll evolve meta-strategies, sometimes to cooperate, sometimes to manipulate one another. Trading floors are going quiet. The next generation of traders won’t shout orders; they’ll train AI agents. The winners won’t just be institutions, they’ll be retail traders who fine-tune their swarms alongside human judgment. We’re entering the agentic arms race. Markets of tomorrow won’t sleep or panic. Agentic AI will learn, evolve, compete and occasionally conspire at breakneck speed. While institutions continue to build layers of agents, retail investors face a choice. Follow the herd into AI stocks, or start training their own AI as their wing(wo)man. They won’t have an AlphaGo moment. Quiet, relentless outperformance hides in the charts, open to anyone brave enough to seize their AI agent. Opinion by: Saad Naja, Founder and CEO at PiP World.

Title: Bubble Trouble: Is too much being spent on AI?
URL: https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2025/1108/1542794-ai-bubble-tech/
Time Published: 2025-11-08T07:00:00Z

Adam Maguire Business Journalist Michael Burry - the man who famously spotted the US subprime mortgage crisis years before most others - thinks there's an AI bubble. This week it was revealed that he had taken a $1.1 billion bet against chip-maker Nvidia and Peter Thiel’s Palantir – where he will profit if their stock prices fall. But it’s not just professional market sceptics like Burry that think things may be overheated in tech. Jamie Dimon, the head of JP Morgan, recently warned that US stocks – in particular tech stocks - are over-heated. Morgan Stanley chief executive Ted Pick and Goldman Sachs head David Soloman have also warned of an impending correction. Even big tech cheerleaders like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos have said there is an AI bubble. Meanwhile Sam Altman, the head of AI revolution icon OpenAI, thinks valuations and spending has gotten carried away. Why do they think this is a bubble? You can get some clue of why if you look at the quarterly results some of the world’s big tech companies published last week. Microsoft, for example, said it spent nearly $35 billion on capital expenditure in the quarter. Capital expenditure wouldn’t necessarily all be AI-related but in this case the vast bulk of it is. To put that figure into context, the measures included in Ireland’s Budget 2026 were worth around €9.4 billion - or roughly $10.8 billion. So Microsoft spent more than three times the Government's annual Budget package in a single quarter. Meanwhile Facebook owner Meta said it would spend as much as $72 billion on capital expenditure this year. Google owner Alphabet said it would spend up to $93 billion. Amazon said its full year capital budget would be $125 billion this year – and even higher next year. And that’s just four of the big tech companies - it wouldn’t include AI spending by other large firms like Apple, Tesla, X, Oracle or Palantir. Nor would it include the tens hundreds of millions - or even billions - being spent by other big-but-not-massive companies. Or the money being invested by venture capitalists and private equity. And most of that money is ultimately going towards building data centres and buying high end computer chips - but it’s also being spent at employee level too. Back in June Sam Altman claimed that Meta was offering his top engineers pay packets valued at $300m if they moved over to Team Zuckerberg. That included a $100m signing-on bonus. The likes of Meta have also spent billions to buy stakes in, or acquire outright, AI startups that have promising-looking ideas. The scale of all of this is so significant that Goldman Sachs estimated that AI investment was a bigger contributor to growth in the US economy in the first half of the year than consumer spending. In fact, if you took out the money being spent on AI, the US economy was stagnant in the first half of the year. And tech companies’ valuations have risen to match – largely based on the promise and expectation that all this spending now will result in them making even more money in the not-too-distant future. Are there any signs of that happening? No - An MIT study in August found that, when you strip away all the hype, 95% of firms were getting zero return on their AI investments. It’s not entirely true to say that no-one is making money from AI… some are. Or, more specifically, one company is. So far the only clear winner from the AI race is Nvidia, which designs the computer chips that are powering all of these data centres that big tech firms are rushing to build. It’s gone from being a relatively niche player in the market to being the most valuable listed company in the world. As recently as its 2020 results, Nvidia had profits of $2.8 billion – which isn’t bad by any measure. But now, in the single quarter between May and July, it had a profit of $26.4 billion. It is now comfortably on track to make more than $100 billion in profit this year – which would be about 36 times the profit it made just a few years ago. For most others, though, it’s a different story. Despite their huge investments to date the likes of Meta, Alphabet and Microsoft have yet to really show the benefit AI has brought to their bottom line. Some are pointing to it being a cost-saving measure – Amazon’s recent jobs cuts, for example, were framed as them leaning on AI to be able to reduce bureaucracy. But if that’s the rationale it will take many more cuts to justify the hundreds of billions of investment. And it’s not just the big tech companies that are struggling to make it viable – the dedicated AI creators are not seeing a return yet either. Anthropic made a $5.3 billion loss last year. Elon Musk’s xAI is predicted to record a $13 billion loss this year. Even the poster-child of AI – OpenAI – made a $5 billion loss last year. That means that every time you ask ChatGPT to compose an email for you, or ask it to devise the best scrambled eggs recipe, it’s costing them money. Despite that, there are suggestions it could be valued at $1 trillion when it floats on the New York Stock Exchange in the not-too-distant future. So if it’s not making money, what’s the justification for that valuation? OpenAI and its backers hope it is following the same kind of playbook we’ve seen from so many tech start-ups over the years. This is where it has a great idea, great technology and great people – and once it builds a big enough customer base and gains efficiencies of scale, the profits will start to flow. And, in fairness, its revenue looks to have more than doubled year on year – and it recently started to unveil a range of products and services it plans to provide – including a web-browser, which will open the door to it service ads too. In the meantime, though, they’ve also committed to invest around $1.4 trillion in other companies over the next few years – which will include buying computer chips and data centre capacity to help handle the queries from all of those extra customers. But within those deals it’s making is also an interesting dynamic that has added to concerns about an AI bubble – and that’s how a lot of the investment that’s taking place seem to be almost circular. For example, one big part of OpenAI’s recent investments was a $300 billion deal with Oracle to tap into its data centre capacity. In turn, Oracle has committed to spend tens of billions of dollars to buy Nvidia chips to power its data centres. Meanwhile, Nvidia has invested $100 billion of its money into OpenAI. Which essentially means that the three companies are passing billions of dollars around in a circle. So if this is a bubble, what happens when it bursts? Well the first thing there is the 'when’ of the when. Just because there’s a growing consensus that there is a bubble, doesn’t mean that it’s ready to pop. Going back to Michael Burry – he made his first bet against the subprime mortgage market in mid-2005; it took pretty much two years for that bet to pay off. And as readers (or viewers) of The Big Short may remember, he received a lot of flak during those two years from investors who thought he was costing them a fortune. It should also be said that, while he was right that time, he can be wrong too. He took bets out against big tech stocks in 2023 too, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has risen by nearly 80% since then. But assuming it is a matter of ‘when’ and not ‘if’, there are a whole range of predictions around what a burst AI bubble might mean. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has kind of downplayed his company’s exposure - saying that spending all of this money on data centres now was essentially just front-loading what they’ll need in the years ahead. So, he argues, worst case scenario it’ll just mean they’ll be futureproofed against a natural growth of demand for its services in the years ahead. Amazon’s Jeff Bezos suggested that while this is a bubble, it wouldn’t be a ‘bad’ bubble like the financial crisis. Instead he said it would be a ‘good’ bubble, comparing it to the Dot Com crash. His argument is that while a lot of companies collapsed in the Dot Com crash, a handful that had good ideas and viable models – including Amazon and Google – survived and thrived. He thinks the same will happen here – the tide will go out and expose those that can’t back up all of their big talk, but the useful platforms will stick it out and usher in big changes for the world. Of course that comparison does skirt over the negative impact this kind of ‘good’ bubble can have. All of those bankruptcies and valuation write-downs means lost investments and a shock to the stock market, which perhaps impacts people’s pensions, and likely leads to job cuts too. So it wouldn’t just be a case of adjusting a balance sheet or two and moving on. But is there the potential for contagion? Again, it depends first and foremost on how much more bubbly the bubble gets before it bursts. But no more than AI investment is feeding growth in the wider US and world economy right now, a dramatic collapse in investment and valuations in the sector will have a knock-on effect on national and global GDP too. There’s also the very practical impact of jobs cuts – direct and indirect. If it turns out that the AI industry has gotten too big and expensive, some of those being hired now will likely be let go. Meanwhile companies that see the value of their AI investments getting written down may need to make cuts elsewhere to cover their losses. It could also have a knock-on impact on areas like construction and consumer spending. And one concern around a potential AI crash relates to that circularity of investment that’s being seen at the moment. A big part of the boom in Nvidia’s revenue is based on the scramble to make use of OpenAI’s tools. Oracle’s stock price also reflects the fact that it’s been promised $300 billion of business from OpenAI in the coming years. As a major shareholder in OpenAI, Microsoft’s valuation is also boosted by the belief that Sam Altman’s firm will become massively profitable in the near future. Meanwhile Amazon has done its own multi-billion dollar deal with OpenAI to provide it with data centre capacity to power its AI platforms. That means that all of those big tech companies have a lot to gain from OpenAI’s success – and a lot to lose if it turns out that the technology isn’t nearly as useful as many hope. Its importance to these major firms has led to suggestions by some that the company is already too big to fail. Some have even started to call for it to be broken up to reduce the systemic risk it poses. That’s despite the fact that it’s currently still privately held, and still losing billions of dollars a year. Business Journalist Follow@AdamMaguire © RTÉ 2025.

Title: 'Big Short' Michael Burry's $1bn market crash bet pays off as stocks suffer worst day since Trump's tariff meltdown

Skip to comments. Posted on 11/07/2025 9:24:26 AM PST by DFG The man who predicted the 2008 financial crash could soon be proven right again. On Tuesday, Michael Burry — who became a household name after predicting the 2008 crash and inspiring the film The Big Short — had wagered more than $1 billion that Wall Street's AI boom will end in tears. Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

Now the cracks are showing. US tech stocks are on track for their worst week since Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariffs rattled global markets in April. Eight of the most valuable AI-driven companies — among them Nvidia, Meta, Palantir and Oracle — have lost a staggering $1.1 trillion in market value since the end of last week. By midday in New York, The S&P 500 was down 1.2 percent, the Nasdaq 2 percent and the Dow 300 points, or 0.7 percent. The Nasdaq is on course for a 4 percent weekly loss, its sharpest decline since Trump's tariff war years. Burry specifically bet that the value of stock for Nvidia and Palantir — two of the market’s hottest AI plays — would fall, and those two have been hardest hit. Shares of Nvidia — the world's most valuable company — tumbled another 4 percent Friday, leaving them down 13 percent for the week. Palantir has plunged 17 percent since Monday, Filings show Burry's hedge fund, Scion Asset Management, disclosed put options worth about $900 million against Palantir and $187 million against Nvidia. A put option is a financial bet that pays off if a company's share price falls. CEO Jensen Huang made things worse by admitting that 'China is going to win the AI race.' He later tried to walk back the remark, but investors were already spooked. (Excerpt) Read more at dailymail.co.uk ...

Love Business Insider? Log into Google and make us a preferred source. Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up now Market musings Earnings season has been good. Perhaps… too good. The run-ups in the stock market's favorite tech darlings after earnings last week apparently pushed valuations to a point where investors decided they'd had enough. It's led to a chaotic current week, with two separate valuation-driven sell-offs in a matter of three days. The institutional class is as split as ever over what the future holds. JPMorgan is recommending investors buy any dips. Billionaire Ray Dalio sees a short-term rally, and then a Fed-driven sell-off. And then there's the overhang of what will happen with President Trump's tariffs, which are facing a prolonged legal battle. But that only tells part of the story. As retail investing has exploded in popularity, so has the influence of the day-traders populating Reddit and Discord forums. Their behavior can often be a harbinger of what's to come, and the strategy team JPMorgan has conveniently been keeping tabs. Here are the four main themes that have dominated retail trading over the past week as volatility has raged. They went on their biggest buying spree in four months, almost entirely in mega-cap tech But they're not blindly buying market dips They're getting tired of gold and bitcoin after torrid rallies They're most excited about these meme stocks Judging by a "social interest score" tracked by JPMorgan, the "most hyped" stocks this past week were: Beyond Meat, Nokia, POET Technologies, UiPath, Palantir, Nvidia, Chipotle, and Reddit. Are you a retail investor that's leaning into these trends, or doing something completely different? Let us know what portfolio moves you've been making at firsttrade@businessinsider.com. On the heels of another difficult day in the market, console yourself with another example of the value-creating impact of AI deals. Snap stock surged as much as 18% after announcing a $400 million partnership with Perplexity AI, to incorporate its AI search engine into Snapchat. It's a good reminder that — even on the toughest of days — AI deals trump all, and can carry a stock to market-beating performance. Is the gig up for gold? At least as an S&P 500-crushing speculative asset? It appears so. Following a 20% run up through September and into October, the price of the precious metal has come back down to earth. The chart above, from JPMorgan, reflects a corresponding shift in sentiment, specifically among retail investors. Note the blue line, which shows that retail buying has plateaued. Each Friday, I'll discuss and review a piece of markets- or finance-related media: movies, books, TV shows, podcasts, etc. Today's entry is the movie "Boiler Room" (2000). There are some quotes at the beginning of "Boiler Room" — namely "I just want to get in" and "nobody wants to work for it anymore" — that echo the frivolous, fundamental-lite stock market activity that characterized the meme stock era. Right away, you know this is a movie that's going to deal with a popular evergreen theme: how to get rich quick. This film is best approached by suspending belief around the illegalities occurring. The schemes are sub-Wolf-of-Wall-Street penny-stock pump and dumps, where the companies don't even exist. It would never happen, at least this flagrantly, but that's not the point. It's all merely a vessel for the movie's top-notch cast of wisecracking early-2000s actors masquerading as stock-brokers. Vin Diesel executes a pitch-perfect sales call in front of 100 associates, closing the deal to rapt applause. Ben Affleck — the firm's head recruiter — delivers two scintillating motivational monologues to a room full of new hires. Key quote: "Anybody who tells you that money is the root of all evil, doesn't f**king have any." Leading man Giovanni Ribisi excels as a whip-smart, money-hungry youngster who's looking to make the leap from backroom poker games to stock-broking millionaire. And it feels like Jamie Kennedy is acting in a different movie — perhaps channeling his "Malibu's Most Wanted" character at some points — but it doesn't matter, he steals every scene he's in. At one point, the core group of brokers sit around trading extended recitations of the original "Wall Street." There's an analogy in there somewhere. Of course, the movie doesn't take place exclusively within the walls of the Long Island-based JT Marlin (yes, it's that obvious of a play on JPMorgan). The crew ventures into NYC a handful of times to beat up rival brokers from the "real" Wall Street, and party at a hotel in celebration of a new (fraudulent) IPO launch. These are electric and hilarious scenes, and they show that the movie is at its strongest when the core cast is ripping it up, even if a lot of the dialogue is offensive enough to be left in the year 2000. It's not the best finance movie of all time. But, for my money, it's the most fun. And for that reason it gets a 10/10 rating. Do you have any ideas about what I should review next?

Title: The Vulnerability of Forests to Natural Disturbances

Full Content:
Ministèrede l'Agriculture,de l'Agro-Alimentaireet de la Souverainetéalimentaire 07 novembre 2025 Info + Partager la page Sommaire The Analysis Notes present, in four pages, the main points of discussion on a current topic relevant to the areas of activity of the Department of Agriculture, Agri-Food, and Food Sovereignty. Depending on the topic, they take a forward-looking, strategic, or evaluative approach. Analysis n°224 Forests are increasingly threatened by natural disturbances, which are being exacerbated by climate change. This note explores the growing risks that will emerge in the future. It details several vulnerability factors and the associated environmental and economic impacts. In an uncertain context, understanding the interplay between the various components of risk makes it possible to prioritise actions that can mitigate it. Proactive management of forest fuel or the recovery of storm-damaged timber, for instance, are measures that can help address this challenge. Forests are affected by so-called “natural” disturbances, whether biotic (e.g. pathogens) or abiotic (e.g. fires). Their occurrence may nevertheless be of anthropogenic origin, as is the case for the majority of fires in France. Climate change intensifies these disturbances and places an increasing threat on the functions of forests: timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity reservoir, etc. The recent multiplication of extreme events, such as the fires in France during the summer of 2022 or the wildfire events that devastated forests in the Aude department in August 2025, has heightened the visibility of these disturbances in public debate. Awareness has also grown of their role in the decline of the land carbon sink1. The concepts associated with the notion of “risk” are numerous, each carrying a specific meaning. This note clarifies the constituent elements of the risks generated by natural disturbances in forests and illustrates them with concrete cases concerning Europe (including France) and the United States. The first part defines the components of risk (hazard, asset, vulnerability) and presents trends of the future evolution of hazards for the main disturbance agents. The second part reviews some of the environmental and economic consequences of current and future disturbances. Finally, examples of practices to reduce vulnerability through forest management or organisational solutions are described. Risk is a polysemous term, defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as the potential for adverse consequences for a system to which certain values and objectives are attached2. It is a composite notion, resulting from the encounter of three components: a hazard, an element exposed to that hazard (or asset), and its vulnerability. The hazard corresponds to the physical phenomenon capable of causing harm. The notion covers both the characteristics of the event (e.g. wind speed, burnt area) and its probability of occurrence. Hazards that correspond to punctual events (e.g. fire, storm) cause catastrophic mortality, i.e. sudden and massive, in forest stands. Others have more diffuse impacts, such as droughts, which correspond to periods of thermal and/or rainfall anomalies compared to past references. The exposed element here is the forest ecosystem, which possesses use and non-use values for society and provides ecosystem services (e.g. timber production, landscape amenities). The asset corresponds to the proper ecosystem functioning of the forest. Independently of its degree of exposure, i.e. presence in a given area, a forest is characterised by a certain level of vulnerability, meaning a predisposition to being negatively impacted. It may be vulnerable due to its predisposition to damage (sensitivity) or its limited ability to adjust to and recover from damage (adaptive capacity). Figure 1 – Breakdown of the concept of risk Ce schéma montre que le risque émerge à l’intersection de trois notions : l’aléa, l’exposition et la vulnérabilité. This diagram visually represents that risk emerges at the intersection of three notions: hazard, exposure and vulnerability. Reading: risk emerges from the encounter of a hazard that affects an exposed element characterised by a certain level of vulnerability. Source : IPCC, 2022, Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability Vulnerability may be intrinsic, linked to the physiological traits of trees, the composition and structure of stands, etc.3. For instance, some species are more resistant to fires due to thicker bark, or better adapted to rapid recovery, by resprouting (e.g. oaks) or via seed banks (e.g. Aleppo pine). Conversely, a forest with a high presence of fuel (e.g. dense understorey) is more prone to high-intensity fires. Forest vulnerability may also be extrinsic, linked to forest management, spatial planning, or land use. For example, the presence of roads makes forests more accessible for prevention and firefighting, but also more exposed to fire outbreaks caused by humans. Similarly, the existence of a monitoring system enables earlier detection of pathogen invasions. Climate change increases risk by worsening disturbance regimes (the hazard component), in other words by altering the frequency, intensity and seasonality of disturbance events and the areas they affect. These effects may be direct, for example when water stress due to lack of rainfall and longer, more intense periods of high temperatures weaken trees. They may also be indirect, particularly when new pathogens migrate and become viable (e.g. pine processionary caterpillar) or when endemic species enter epidemic phases (e.g. spruce bark beetle). Between the periods 1950–2000 and 2001–2019, damage caused by natural disturbances increased by 17% in Europe. Storms accounted for 46% of damage across both periods, followed by fires (24%), bark beetles (17%), other biotic agents (8%, e.g. diseases such as ash dieback and chestnut blight), and abiotic agents (8%, e.g. drought, snow). The increase in damage has been particularly marked in recent years for fires and bark beetles (Figure 2). The latter were responsible for 50% of the timber harvest in Germany in 2021. In France, in Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, 30,000 hectares of coniferous forests containing spruces (18% of the regional total) were destroyed or harvested between 2018 and 2022 due to bark beetle attacks. Since 2023, the crisis has affected all altitudinal levels of the Jura massif, including above 1,000 m4. Droughts, meanwhile, affected 0.5 million hectares of forests between 1987 and 2016 in Europe, and four of the five most severe events occurred after 20005. Figure 2 – Annual damage due to natural forest disturbances in Europe, 1950–2019 Ce graphique représente l’évolution des dommages en forêt causés par plusieurs catégories de perturbations naturelles, de 1950 à 2019. On voit que ceux-ci ont fortement augmenté au cours du temps. This graph shows the evolution of forest damage caused by several categories of natural disturbances, from 1950 to 2019. It illustrates the strong increase in damage over time. Source : Patacca M. et al. 2022, “Significant increase in natural disturbance impacts on European forests since 1950”, Global Change Biology Southern Europe could, during the 21st century, experience a 40 to 100% increase in annual burnt area. The fire season could lengthen by 20 days, and the probability of “megafires” increase tenfold6, 7. Temperate and boreal regions would also be affected, albeit to a lesser extent. In France, fire risk is expected to rise particularly sharply in the West and along the Mediterranean coastline8. For a +4 °C warming by the end of the century, the fire season would last 131 days and fires would affect 67% of the south-eastern quarter of the country, compared with 78 days and 28% at present9. Climate change accelerates the development cycle of pathogens and extends the areas favourable to them. The main epidemic currently underway is that of the spruce bark beetle. In western Europe, the damage it causes could be six times higher in 2021–2030 compared with 1971–201010. Storms are rare and complex events that are difficult to model. Climate change could increase wind speeds and make extreme events more common. In central Europe, a storm that is currently expected once a century could see its return period shortened to around 70 years by 210011. The different hazards interact with one another. For example, a forest damaged by a storm is more vulnerable to pathogens, and a drought increases the likelihood of fires. These interactions are expected to intensify under climate change, particularly with regard to biotic risks, making it necessary to adopt a “multi-hazard” perspective12. The occurrence of a hazard directly alters the structure and composition of the forest, as well as the ecosystem services it provides. In the short term, many trees may be destroyed or damaged, and biogeochemical cycles and habitats disrupted. The reorganisation phase that follows immediately after the hazard is crucial13, as it is when the communities that will make up the future forest establish themselves. Several outcomes are possible, ranging from full resilience (same composition and structure) to transition towards a non-forest state (in the case of major and/or repeated hazards), with intermediate states also possible. Biodiversity is affected through the impacts of disturbances on habitats. An affected area may see its species richness (number of species present) increase, decrease or remain stable14. This ambiguous relationship varies depending on the species and the dynamics of disturbances. Negative impacts often concern species that favour closed canopies (e.g. lichens), while others depend on disturbances to survive and establish themselves in open environments. The highest biodiversity levels, at landscape scale, are observed for disturbances of medium severity and size. Conversely, extreme events are generally harmful due to their tendency to homogenise habitats over large areas. The disappearance of a particular species may also be caused by certain hazards (e.g. pathogen affecting a specific tree species, such as ash dieback). A global meta-analysis has shown a negative impact of disturbances on most ecosystem services, particularly carbon sequestration. Soil quality and organic content, timber production and water quality are also affected15. Fires, for instance, increase soil erosion, reduce the recreational value of forests, and cause carbon emissions and release volatile compounds that can affect human health. According to a recent estimate, the three main disturbance agents in Europe (storms, fires, bark beetles) currently threaten the provision of forest ecosystem services by 10.4 to 12.3%. In total, 20 million hectares of forest (9.7% of the total area) would see their multifunctionality threatened, particularly in central and western Europe (Figure 3). Figure 3 – Areas affected by high risk of loss of forest ecosystem services in Europe Cette figure comporte des cartes qui montrent où sont situées, en Europe, les forêts dont les services écosystémiques sont le plus menacés par les perturbations naturelles. Les cartes concernent la production de bois, le stockage de carbone, la protection contre l’érosion et l’usage récréatif. This figure contains maps showing where, in Europe, forests have ecosystem services most threatened by natural disturbances. The maps relate to timber production, carbon storage, protection against erosion and recreational use. Reading: the coloured areas correspond to those most affected (beyond the 8th decile) by the risk to the ecosystem service considered. Other areas are also affected, but the level of risk is lower. Source : Lecina Diaz, J., et al., 2024, “Ecosystem services at risk from disturbance in Europe’s forests”, Global Change Biology Natural hazards pose risks to timber production and the wood industry. A major crisis, such as a storm, causes in the short term an influx of lower-quality timber on the market, reducing prices and disrupting trade16. Later, the damage causes a reduction in timber supply and pressure on prices (which rise), potentially lasting for several decades. In the Czech Republic, the 2018 bark beetle crisis caused an increase of 5.3 to 18 million m³ (+340%) in salvaged damaged timber compared with 2017, leading to a drop in timber prices from €55/m³ to €15/m³ (–73%)17. Disturbances also affect the value of forest land. For example, it decreased by an average of 10% between 1984–2003 and 2001–2020 in western US states, due to the multiplication of fires and droughts. Even unburnt areas are affected, to a lesser extent, through a change in risk perception by buyers18. Hazards also pose a risk of non-permanence for carbon stocks mobilised to mitigate climate change. In Europe, in the future, carbon losses linked to natural disturbances could be of the same order of magnitude as the gains expected from forest management aimed at mitigating climate change19. Due to the inherent uncertainty of meteorological phenomena, the forest carbon sink may vary greatly from year to year20. For example, Storm Vaia alone reduced Italy’s forest carbon sink by 4% in 201821. Recovering damaged timber for industry nevertheless makes it possible to transfer part of the carbon to downstream sectors, partially mitigating these consequences. The introduction of new pests could cause further degradation of the carbon sink. Seidl et al.22 estimate that 10% of European forest carbon would be exposed to five major new pests in Europe by 2080 under a high-warming scenario (RCP 8.5). An invasion by these pests would increase carbon losses due to natural hazards from +2.3% (for beech canker) to +50% (for the Asian longhorn beetle, which attacks several hardwood species). Beyond the direct mortality due to hazards, the decline of the carbon sink may also be attributed to the loss of photosynthetic activity by dying trees (Figure 4). Figure 4 – Breakdown of the decline of the French forest carbon sink between 2010 and 2020 Ce diagramme montre l’évolution du puits de carbone forestier en France de 2010 à 2020. On y voit que sa forte baisse est principalement due aux impacts du changement climatique, et notamment aux dépérissements dus aux perturbations naturelles. This diagram shows the evolution of the forest carbon sink in France from 2010 to 2020. It illustrates that its sharp decline is mainly due to the impacts of climate change, in particular dieback caused by natural disturbance. Source : Secrétariat général à la planification écologique, 2023 1 Direct action on hazards is often difficult, but risk can be reduced by lowering the vulnerability of exposed forests. Interventions are possible at different levels. Two examples are presented here: fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber. Many other measures, which we do not develop here, can also contribute to reducing vulnerability: diversification of forest composition and structure, enhanced monitoring, raising awareness among local stakeholders, etc. In forests, the presence of fuel in the understorey (e.g. low vegetation, branches) increases the risk of fire. It raises the probability of fire outbreaks and their ability to intensify and spread. When fuel is dry and continuous, the risk is even greater. Removing this vegetation preventively reduces forest vulnerability, particularly by lowering sensitivity, while also affecting the hazard component. This is, for example, the aim of the legal obligations for clearing undergrowth. These apply, in 43 French departments, to land located within 200 m of forest areas, within a radius of 50 m around buildings. These “wildland-urban” interface zones are particularly vulnerable, due to the high potential for fire outbreaks and the presence of buildings, people and economic activities. Similar measures exist elsewhere, for instance in Catalonia, Spain. In some regions, grazing is used to reduce fuel, through payments for environmental services23. A recent study assessed the impact of forest fuel management in California, where fires caused average annual damage estimated at $117 billion between 2017 and 202124. By 2050, the increase in fire intensity could be offset by the annual treatment of 240,000 hectares. The current target is to treat 400,000 hectares, which would avoid losses of $10.9 billion for an estimated annual cost of $3 billion, while each year of delay in achieving this target would lead to $4 billion in losses. However, according to the economists behind the study, the optimal area to treat to maximise benefits would be 1.6 million hectares per year, four times higher than the current target. Fuel can also be deliberately burnt preventively. Prescribed burning is a preventive measure that reduces the fuel load to prevent fire outbreaks. In France, it is planned by the State, local authorities or their representatives, and carried out by professionals. This practice also helps to maintain the good condition of certain ecosystems. Another solution, tactical fires and backfires, are firefighting techniques used during a blaze. They aim to channel the fire and support firefighting personnel. When storms occur, they generate a sudden influx of damaged timber. Recovering it enables owners to generate income, which is then reinvested in forest management. Being able to commercialise this “crisis timber” improves the adaptive capacity of forests. Conversely, leaving such timber on site increases the likelihood of another crisis (e.g. disease, fire outbreak), raising the sensitivity (and therefore vulnerability) of the stand to potential cascading hazards. Following a major crisis, wood recovery may be coordinated and supported by the State. It mainly involves two methods: storing timber for later processing locally; or exporting it to other regions25. These interventions help to ease pressure on local markets and smooth out negative economic impacts (e.g. price falls). First, an assessment of the damage must be carried out to prioritise operations. Rapid intervention is particularly necessary in the case of disease, to avoid its spread and timber degradation. During storage, timber health can be stabilised by treating it once removed from the forest (heat treatment, fumigation) and by ensuring proper storage conditions (ventilation, distance from forest, contact with the ground). A timber mobilisation plan was implemented in France following Storm Klaus (2009), which destroyed 42.5 million m³ of timber, mainly in the Aquitaine region. It included direct support for timber storage (creation and rehabilitation of storage areas) and transport outside the region, for a total of €126 million. Ultimately, 55% of the 29.5 million m³ of timber harvested post-storm benefited from direct aid. An economic model26 showed that this plan encouraged storage (+25%), accelerated and increased timber recovery (+33%), although it did not prevent the fall in prices (–60% for maritime pine). Over ten years, the plan is estimated to have generated an economic gain of €44 million for the forest-wood sector. An even more storage-focused strategy would have been more beneficial but would have slowed the recovery of prices, to the detriment of local producers. In the future, more damaged timber will be available due to the worsening of disturbance regimes. A recent foresight study27 emphasises the importance of anticipating this dynamic, not only for the economic aspects mentioned above, but also for maintaining the forest carbon sink. Upstream, it will be necessary to increase proactive harvesting of declining timber and prioritise it, in crisis years, over standard harvesting. Downstream, processing and storage capacities will need to be increased. Innovation will also be a key factor, in order to make better use of downgraded timber and, where possible, direct it towards long-life uses (e.g. construction), which are more beneficial from a climate perspective. The vulnerability of forests to natural disturbances, exacerbated by climate change, is a crucial issue for the management of forest ecosystems. This note has clarified the components of risk, distinguishing hazard, vulnerability and the assets associated with forests. Concrete examples show that forests are increasingly exposed to multiple hazards, particularly in Europe, with varied effects on ecosystem services, the forest economy and biodiversity. Adaptation strategies, such as fuel management and the recovery of damaged timber, can mitigate these impacts by reducing forest vulnerability. In the future, the development of a multi-hazard approach and proactive management practices will be crucial. To this end, it will be necessary to rely on clear conceptual frameworks in order to target the different components of risk appropriately. However, uncertainties remain about the complex interactions between the different hazards and the scale of future changes. Further research is needed to refine our knowledge, particularly regarding the impacts of extreme events. Other elements beyond forests are exposed, and potentially vulnerable, to the hazards discussed here. These include populations (fires can harm health through air pollution) and infrastructure (transport, housing, etc.). Any strategy for adapting to “forest” hazards must therefore be cross-sectoral and systemic, looking beyond the forest itself and considering these multiple components.
