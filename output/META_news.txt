Title: Nokia Vaults Higher On Proof of Growth In AI Infrastructure

ByR. Scott Raynovich, Contributor. It sounds like a cliché, but I was recently asked about Nokia on the golf course. I had returned from a Nokia-sponsored analyst conference at the swank Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, and a friend of mine was curious about what they were up to. “Are they still doing phones?” asked the friend, who is a retired wealth advisor. This might be a question that most people would ask, unaware that the company has been in the process of a long effort to diversify from telecom infrastructure. Nokia does, in fact, still sell phones. But it now has new growth in the best neighborhood: AI infrastructure. In its quarterly earnings announced early today in Europe, the Finnish company reported results reflecting 9% overall revenue growth and big gains in its renewed strategic focus on datacenter networking and AI infrastructure. As proven by its recent earnings, Nokia has shown it can grow in new markets, including AI. Investors love that. Nokia’s stock vaulted 10% in U.S.-based trading today following the results. Nokia reported third-quarter profit ahead of market expectations on Thursday, driven by strong optical and cloud demand. This included growth in AI-focused datacenter sales following its acquisition of optical networking specialist Infinera. In announcing its results, Nokia management said artificial intelligence and cloud customers accounted for 6% of group net sales and 14% of network infrastructure sales, with optical networks up 19%. Some key takeaways: With the news, Nokia shows that the turnaround architected by former Nokia CEO Pekka Lundmark is bearing fruit. Lundmark, frustrated by years of sluggish growth in telecom, saw the need to diversify by boosting products geared toward datacenter infrastructure. This also included a large acquisition of optical networking company Infinera for $2.3 billion, which was announced in 2024 and completed this year. In the quarter, the company showed impressive growth of 11% in network infrastructure, growing to €1.95 billion ($2.26 billion US). Cloud and Network Services surprised the street with sales of €645 million ($750 million US), 17% above estimates, according to Raymond James. Nokia now expects annual operating profit between 1.7 billion and 2.2 billion euros, a slight upgrade to the previous range of up to 2.1 billion. Lundmark’s turnaround plan, which was described by himself as very difficult, now appears to be prescient. The company is finally emerging from under the long dark cloud of telecom, where for years it was weighed down by disappointing returns in the 5G infrastructure investment cycle. This year, ahead of the industry’s big Mobile World Congress trade conference in Barcelona, Lundmark handed the reigns over to an American, Justin Hotard, who brings a background in datacenter and enterprise. Hotard held previous executive roles at Intel, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and NCR Corporation. “We have seen some improvements in CSP [communications service provider] expectations, along with the strong order intake I mentioned in AI and cloud,” said Hotard on the company earnings conference call. “In fact, entering the fourth quarter, our backlog coverage is stronger than in recent years. We’re also pleased with our progress on the Infinera acquisition." It’s possible that the telecom frustration was a blessing in disguise. Now, Nokia can sail into the land of rainbows and unicorns: AI. Nokia has now shown proof that a successful pivot is underway and it is now well-positioned with datacenter networking products, including its high-performance SR Linux-powered routing and switch portfolio as well as the Infinera optical products. At the recent analyst even in Arizona, Nokia highlighted customers and potential wins in AI infrastructure, including GPU clouds. That area has already been anchored by a deal with recent IPO CoreWeave. But some analysts say that bigger game may be in the mix, including Meta and Google. “We believe Nokia shares a new Meta optical scale-across project with Ciena, and the optical book-to-bill again meaningfully exceeded 1x," Raymond James analysts Simon Leopold wrote in a research note. “IP traction is emerging with footholds with Microsoft, Google, and CoreWeave, and a new deal with Nscale.” Many Wall St. analysts rushed to bump up their estimates on the news. Raymond James and Deutsche Bank both lifted their price estimates for Nokia, with Raymond James raising its target to $6.50 from $5 and Deutsche Bank going from €4.75 to €4.25 on European exchanges. Futuriom has been highlighting Nokia's potential success with AI-focused clients like CoreWeave. Nokia's flexible, open-source SR Linux operating system has been a key differentiator, with customers citing its simplicity, reliability, and economics. Nokia's solution provided high performance while also demonstrating significant energy efficiency, a critical factor for large-scale AI networking infrastructure. This quarter may well represent the start of a new era for Nokia, as it has boosted its reputation as major supplier of networking infrastructure for data centers and AI. Futuriom provides paid research and marketing services to technology companies, including Nokia, with the goal of providing accurate insight into how cloud and AI infrastructure markets are evolving.

Title: Earnings news keeps European shares in the green

Earnings boosts from brands such as Gucci maker Kering kept European markets in the green as losses from major components reversed yesterday’s gains in Dublin. Dublin The Iseq All-Share index ended the session down 0.49 per cent to 11,603.88. Kerry Group topped the Iseq after the release of its Q3 results showed volume growth and strong margin expansion. It closed up 4.73 per cent to a share price of €83.05. Agriculture group Origin Enterprises also had a good day, adding 3.84 per cent to reach €3.79. Permanent TSB led the way for the banks, gaining 0.87 per cent while Bank of Ireland and AIB lost ground, falling 1.05 per cent and 1.72 per cent. A number of major Iseq components fell on the day, dragging down the index. Airliner Ryanair saw its shares fall 1.91 per cent on the day, while fellow big cap Kingspan fell 1.22 per cent to €68.75. London Britain’s stock market ended the day at a new high. The blue chip FTSE 100 share index posted a new closing high after new US sanctions on Russia drove up the value of UK energy companies. This takes its gains so far this year to more than 17 per cent. BP, up 3.7 per cent and Shell up 2.9 per cent were among the big risers, after Donald Trump announced new sanctions on Russia’s two biggest oil producers, Rosneft and Lukoil. In another blow to Russia, European Union countries agreed a new package of sanctions against Russia for its war against Ukraine that includes a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. Pest control firm Rentokil, up 8.3 per cent, ended the day as the top riser, after cheering the City by reporting improved trading at its US pest control division. The London Stock Exchange Group was also in demand and rose 7.1 per cent, after reporting strong growth, an investment by a consortium of banks into its Post Trade Services division and a new £1bn share buy-back programme. The mood in the City was not shaken by the news that UK manufacturing orders have fallen at their fastest rates since July 2020, with factory bosses expecting further weakness. An index of UK precious metal miners advanced, tracking gold prices, as U.S. sanctions against Russia and possible new export controls on China stoked geopolitical concerns, buoying demand for safe-haven assets. Europe The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.35 per cent as European Union countries approved a 19th package of sanctions on Moscow that included a ban on Russian liquefied natural gas imports. Gains in heavyweight energy stocks kept the index in the green after the US imposed new sanctions on Russia and strong corporate earnings, while the US-China trade frictions capped gains. Among corporate updates, Nokia jumped 10.84 per cent after reporting third-quarter profit well ahead of expectations. Kering’s overall group sales fell less than analysts expected in the third quarter. Shares of the French luxury group rose 8.71 per cent. BE Semiconductor rose 4.15 per cent after the chipmaking equipment supplier posted a quarterly operating profit beat. Dassault Systemes fell 12.98 per cent, just off the bottom of STOXX 600, after the French software company cut its full-year revenue growth guidance and published third-quarter results below consensus. Sodexo declined 7.3 per cent after the caterer forecast slower revenue growth in 2026 than in 2025. New York Wall Street was unsettled in midafternoon trading on Thursday, as underwhelming earnings from Tesla and IBM, as well as simmering US-China trade tensions, kept risk appetite on a tight leash. Tesla, which kicked off the ‘Magnificent Seven’ earnings parade, missed third-quarter profit estimates, dragging its shares down with its revenue beat offering little comfort. But even as Tesla slipped, the rest of the tech titans stepped up – with bargain hunters scooping up megacap names. The ‘Magnificent Seven’ cohort, which makes up nearly 35 per cent of the S&P 500’s weight, saw modest gains. Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Broadcom saw single digit growth. Honeywell rose after the industrial giant raised its 2025 profit forecast despite the looming spin-off of its advanced materials unit. The gain kept the Dow afloat. But IBM weighed on the index, sliding due to a slowdown in its key cloud software segment. – Additional reporting, Reuters, Guardian.

But what would a post-bubble nosedive look like? Given the weakness in almost every other sector of the US economy, it could well mean a recession. Economic slumps come in many flavours, though, and the worst tend to follow from financial crises. Yet most experts (with a few exceptions) have not warned of the AI bubble causing a financial crisis. Instead, the conventional wisdom seems to be that if there is a recession, it will look more like the one that followed the dot-com bubble in 2000 than the one following the 2008 global financial crisis. History does provide some support for this view. One well known paper on bubbles and financial crises concludes that “the post-WW2 era appears to have weathered numerous equity price bubbles that did not turn into financial crisis episodes.” But the authors also note that equity-price bubbles can precipitate financial crises if they are fuelled by borrowed money. After all, the Great Depression was preceded by a debt-fuelled “roaring 20s” equity bubble. This matters because, as economist Noah Smith points out, banks are funding “private credit” funds that in turn are lending money to fund the data-centre construction for an anticipated AI boom. Smith wonders whether we will see defaults on those construction loans when the AI bubble bursts, and whether private credit losses could cause a crisis for the banks that ultimately extended that credit. It is also worth pondering whether a bursting AI bubble could compromise the ability of other non-bank financial institutions to repay their loans. A recent JPMorgan analyst note on hedge-fund trading observes that concentration in the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks (companies like Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia) remains near historic highs. Yet the prices of these stocks are highly dependent on the companies’ AI ambitions. If they fall short of their goals, and prices come crashing down, highly leveraged hedge funds may be forced into fire sales, unloading stocks to meet margin calls or repay bank loans. And if those fire sales don’t fetch enough cash, the funds will default on their repayment obligations, potentially undermining the financial condition of the broker-dealers, primary dealers, and banks that extended them credit. Moreover, the same dynamics will also drive down the prices of tech stocks further, potentially forcing other leveraged financial institutions to sell off their portfolios, and so on. Nor should we assume that financial institutions desperate for cash will restrict themselves to selling off tech stocks. On the contrary, they may need — or prefer — to dump other types of assets, transmitting problems to other asset markets. Such a scenario is not far-fetched. The Fed reports that hedge-fund leverage hit historically high levels in 2024, and in a September 2025 commentary, analyst Adam Josephson notes that “hedge fund borrowing/leverage [is] at a record high of $6.2 trillion, up more than 25% vs. a year ago at the end of March.” Specifically, outstanding margin loans from broker-dealers and repurchase agreements from primary dealers are at historically high levels. And bank lending (particularly lending by large banks) to non-bank financial institutions — including broker-dealers, primary dealers, and the hedge funds themselves — is also significantly elevated, with bank loans to NBFIs now accounting for “$1.7 trillion in bank loans, or 13% of loans outstanding.” Meanwhile, US financial regulators continue to permit this expansion of leverage, as well as green-lighting the integration of traditional financial markets with crypto markets (which are also rife with leverage). Despite narratives about Bitcoin and other crypto assets serving as a hedge against risks in other markets, their price movements are highly correlated with equities. Thus, we should expect to see crypto prices fall when the AI bubble bursts, and not just because of fire-sale dynamics. Both crypto and the AI bubble have been inflated by the same kinds of narratives about new technologies shattering old paradigms. If evidence of AI’s limitations starts to permeate the public consciousness during a market crash, more pessimistic sentiment on tech assets could well undermine crypto hype as well. This could then prompt a crash in Ponzi-like crypto assets such as Bitcoin, as well as runs on asset-backed stablecoins. If stablecoin issuers are forced to withdraw their cash reserves from banks, they could trigger a run on those institutions; and if they are forced to dump Treasuries from their reserves, another critically important financial market could be sucked into the maelstrom. Experts might not expect a stock-market crash to cause a financial crisis, but what if they are wrong? With leverage built up in so many parts of the system and asset-price movements so correlated, what if the financial system is a tinder box that could explode when the first spark lands on it? Of course, the financial system may well weather the bursting of the AI bubble, especially if the end arrives with a low hiss rather than a sudden bang. But we shouldn’t count on it.

Title: Looking Back on the Trump Stock Market Crash of 2025

Jason: As you requested, here’s my prewrite on the stock market crash and the start of the second Great Depression so we have something to post the moment it happens. That will probably be before Halloween, but the market might hang on until Thanksgiving. PLEASE REMEMBER not to post before the crash actually occurs! It’s an open secret that the collapse is imminent and that it will make the Great Recession of 2007–9 look like a day at the beach. But we’ll look stupid if we jump the gun, especially in the (admittedly very unlikely) event that the market continues its climb or we suffer only a minor correction. Cheers, Tim P.S. Again, DO NOT push the wrong button and post this when you finish editing! In retrospect, the only surprise about the Crash of 2025 was that anybody was surprised. “We will have a crash,” New York Times financial columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin told 60 Minutes just weeks before the collapse. “Beware these two months,” warned the veteran financial analyst Jon Wolferbarger’s newsletter BullandBearProfits.com, because “Most Major Crashes and Bear Markets” occur in October or November. Wolfbarger himself warned MarketWatch to expect the biggest bear market since 1929. The Motley Fool’s John Fieldsend noted that “the Warren Buffet indicator,” which is the market capitalization of all stocks divided by gross domestic product, stood at its highest point in history. For the sake of comparison, right before the dot-com crash, it had been 140 percent. On October 17, it was 218 percent. The Yale economist Robert Shiller’s cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings, or CAPE, ratio stood at its second-highest point in history; the highest point had been right before the dot-com bubble burst. And yet greedy fools kept shoveling cash into the stock market, boosting the S&P 500 25 percent between April and October. Most of these gains came from four tech stocks that were invested heavily in artificial intelligence: Nvidia, Meta, Microsoft, and Broadcom. The AI chipmaker Nvidia alone drove about one-quarter of the gains. This AI bubble was a haunting echo of the radio-stock bubble prior to the 1929 crash: promising technology, premature expectation of quick profits. RCA was the Nvidia of its day. An October 2025 Bank of America survey of global fund managers found that 54 percent of them thought tech stocks overpriced. Even Chat GPT acknowledged the AI bubble. Another obvious parallel to the Great Depression was President Donald Trump’s reckless tariffs. These brought trade protections to their highest level since Smoot-Hawley, the disastrous tariff Congress imposed eight months after the 1929 crash. The Yale Budget Lab reported that the tariffs cost the average household $2,400 in 2025 and lowered GDP by half a percentage point. But the greatest harm was the heightened level of uncertainty about when and where Trump would impose tariffs. The most visible result was that the number of jobs created each month fell by about 100,000. Yet another parallel with 1929 was the lack of transparency. The crash prompted President Franklin Roosevelt to create the Securities and Exchange Commission to (among other things) compel extensive disclosures about publicly traded stocks. But the rise of largely unregulated private credit and private equity, known collectively as “shadow banking,” made it much harder for the public to assess risk. The collapse of Tricolor Holdings, a subprime auto lender, and First Brands, an auto-parts supplier, both of whose financing was fairly opaque, prompted JPMorgan Chase chief executive Jamie Dimon to observe on October 14, “When you see one cockroach, there are probably more.” Sorkin sounded a similar theme in an October 13 New York Times Magazine piece that drew parallels between the hucksterism and outright fraud preceding the 1929 crash (the subject of Sorkin’s latest book) and the rapid entry of ordinary savers into the risky world of shadow banking. In both instances, financiers waxed eloquent about “democratizing” the market, but “when transformation comes this quickly,” Sorkin warned, it rarely benefits everyone unless it is paired with transparency, oversight and regulation.… The pattern is familiar, stretching back to 1929: Whenever access expands faster than safeguards, charlatans rush in and ordinary investors are often left holding the bag. I’d warned about the instability of private equity in September (“The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump”), but Sorkin, who knew infinitely more about markets than me, was significantly more pessimistic than I was. I phoned my broker just in time. Postscript, 2085, by Greta Noah: To my late great-grandfather’s definitive and widely anthologized account of the Crash of 2025, The New Republic’s editors have asked me to add the following update. It would be America’s bad luck that the Crash of 2025 occurred when a Republican occupied the White House. Public misperceptions to the contrary, Republicans had always been much worse at managing the economy than Democrats. It was hardly coincidence that Herbert Hoover was president at the start of the Great Depression, Ronald Reagan at the start of the savings and loan crisis, and George W. Bush at the start of the 2008 financial crisis. It was even worse luck for America that the Republican who was president when the stock market crashed was the mentally unstable kleptocrat Donald Trump. Trump’s chaotic attempts to revive the economy with additional tax cuts, higher tariffs, and the illegal closure of the SEC drove unemployment so high that in the 2026 midterm he lost both houses of Congress to the Democrats. In April 2027, Trump was impeached for the third time, and the third time proved the charm. Trump was removed from office, with no fewer than 15 Senate Republicans giving Democrats the necessary two-thirds majority to convict. But the year and a half of Trump mismanaging the post-crash economy had taken its toll. Thousands of Baby Boom retirees descended on Washington to demand a bailout for catastrophic losses in their retirement plans. Modeling themselves on Coxey’s Army, the unemployed masses that flooded into Washington during the Panic of 1893 to demand federal jobs, the Boomers, with Trump in mind, called themselves Cocksu—on second thought, let’s set that colorful detail aside. Trump’s attempt to reduce 35 percent unemployment by quadrupling the staff of Immigration and Customs Enforcement shrank the workforce by deporting not just undocumented immigrants but also millions of U.S. citizens, including first lady Melania Trump, Elon Musk, Ana de Armas, John Oliver, and five dozen white Anglo-Saxon Protestants who traced their lineage back to the Mayflower. The deportations reduced competition for jobs, but not enough to offset the continuing shrinkage of job openings as Trump jacked up tariffs on the European Union to 10,000 percent. Treasury Secretary Howard Lutnick, who succeeded Scott Bessent after Bessent was arrested for beating Bill Pulte to death, encouraged Trump to jack up EU tariffs in retaliation against the euro displacing first the dollar and then the World Liberty Financial stablecoin USD1 as the global reserve currency. Twenty years would pass before the economy was back to normal, the workforce stabilized through passage of bipartisan immigration legislation, the Ivy League and other research universities reopened, cryptocurrency outlawed, the Trump Ballroom demolished, the Republican Party replaced by a revived Whig Party, and a greatly diminished financial sector brought back under a strict level of government supervision not seen since the 1960s. The only upside to the global depression that followed the Crash of 2025 was that it diminished carbon emissions to the point that only relatively modest regulatory measures were necessary to eliminate climate change entirely.

Photo / Supplied The New Zealand sharemarket closed up on Thursday, driven by the exchange’s largest companies and positive market updates from Skellerup and Vista Group. The S&P/NZX 50 Index closed up 0.53% or 70.662 points to 13,377.10 after 43.6 million shares worth $146.8 million were traded. The S&P/NZX 20 index was up 0.43%, closing at 7673.63 points, while the S&P/NZX 10 index ended the day at 12,761.47 after rising 0.58%. There were 84 gainers on the main board and 61 decliners. Craigs Investment Partners investment director Mark Lister said the market was up after a “mixed bag” of lead-ins from overseas. “It does feel like markets have maybe just run into a few minor headwinds after a strong period,” Lister said. “We’re certainly outperforming other markets in the region. Aussies are up, but much less than us. The Nikkei in Japan is down a little over 1%, obviously the S&P500 was off slightly off a little bit overnight, while the UK was one of the few markets to be up. So most international markets are off a little bit.” Skellerup Holdings held its annual general meeting on Thursday, with the rubber manufacturer’s earnings lifting by 10% in the first quarter of 2026. The business said demand for its products was robust and called out dairy and infrastructure as notable contributors. “$55 million to $60 million midpoint is in line with where analysts were expecting. The stock is up because it’s a bit of confirmation that analysts weren’t off the mark.” “You could have expected their guidance to be a little soft because of the tariff impact, but they’re managing to absorb that tariff hit and still making decent results, which is great to see.” Skellerup’s share price lifted 1.36% or 7c to $5.20 after 144,980 shares changed hands on turnover worth $754,035.08. Elsewhere, Vista Group gave a third-quarter update, advising that despite the box office experiencing some softness, year-on-year revenue growth continued. Vista Group’s share price rallied 7.03%, up 18c to $2.74. Heartland Group lifted 3c to $1.09 after trading on high volume, with 1.7m shares changing hands on turnover worth $1.8m. Scales Corporation lifted 2.88% or 17c to $6.07, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare lifted 2.14% or 75c to $35.75, while Meridian Energy fell 0.84% or 5c to $5.93. Lister said analysts and investors were keeping a close eye on the next 10 days, which will feature the latest data on US inflation, as well as results from five of the “magnificent seven”: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta. Gold prices sank further on Wednesday while major stock markets mostly fell following some disappointing corporate earnings amid lingering worries over trade tensions. Major US indices fell, with the Dow retreating from a record the prior day, as lacklustre results from Netflix added to angst that upcoming reports from other tech giants may also fall short. “Any time you’ve got stocks that are priced with high expectations, if you’re not meeting those expectations, then the market is going to struggle with that,” said Dave Grecsek, a partner at wealth management firm Aspirant. More broadly, the market is wondering if “we are overextended here in this artificial intelligence trade”, he added. Most European equity indices also fell following declines in leading Asian markets earlier. Tom Raynel is a multimedia business journalist for the Herald, covering small business, retail and tourism.

Title: Tesla stock price continues to show resilience despite sales ‘falling off a cliff’

A Tesla dealership. Photo: Getty In the stock market’s rarefied air where mega-cap technology behemoths reside, Tesla stands out – but for all the wrong reasons. Chief among them is its stunning lack of earnings growth while its stock price continues to soar. The Elon Musk-led electric vehicle-maker was expected to post a 25pc drop in third-quarter profits from a year ago when it reports earnings yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The decline is nothing new, as Tesla’s results have been in retreat for multiple years. What is notable, however, is the way Tesla shares have been impervious to the drop, more than doubling in the past 12 months. It’s a tribute to Mr Musk’s success in turning investors’ attention away from selling EVs and toward his vision of an artificial intelligence company focused on self-driving cars and humanoid robots. The stock was down 0.5pc in early trading yesterday. “The Tesla story is never really about the current quarter, but rather the broader expectations that it can keep innovating and pivoting to the future,” said Daniel Newman, chief executive officer of the technology research and advisory firm the Futurum Group. This hope for the future while discounting the present has taken Tesla’s market valuation to dizzying heights. The shares trade at a whopping 195 times expected earnings over the next 12 months as of Tuesday’s close, up from less then 80 times in April. It’s the fourth most-expensive stock in the S&P 500 Index, trailing only Warner Bros Discovery, Palantir Technologies and Boeing. The company’s valuation is head and shoulders above its peers in the Magnificent Seven: Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft and Nvidia. The Bloomberg Magnificent Seven Index trades roughly 33 times expected earnings as of Tuesday’s close. After Tesla, the next highest valuation in the group belongs to Apple at just over 32 times. Tesla’s problem is that right now it’s a company that manufactures cars, trucks, solar panels and energy storage systems. Its AI vision is years, if not decades, away from generating sales, much less profits. So EVs are the primary way the company can bring in the cash required for its AI investments. And that business is facing slowing demand as the Trump administration pulls federal incentives that had encouraged EV adoption, such as a $7,500 (€6,450) tax credit for buying EVs that expired in September. After Tesla’s plan to sell cheaper EVs was largely met with a shrug, analysts say Tesla’s sales may start to crater this month. Its fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to be around 425,000, according to Barclays analyst Dan Levy. “Fourth-quarter sales don’t look good,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Steve Man. “Falling off a cliff is probably a good way to characterise it.” Join the Irish Independent WhatsApp channel Stay up to date with all the latest news

Title: What we know about the donors funding the White House ballroom

A White House dinner about the project included many tech and crypto companies. While the Trump administration has yet to release a full list of donors contributing to the planned construction of a White House ballroom, a picture of potential donors and companies funding the project is beginning to emerge. President Donald Trump again reiterated in the Oval Office on Wednesday afternoon that the ballroom is being "paid for 100% by me and some friends of mine," referencing donors. "The government is paying absolutely nothing." Trump also appeared to increase the cost estimate by $50-$100 million, telling reporters during his remarks on Wednesday the price tag for the new venue was "about $300 million" -- more than the $200-$250 million estimates previously given. Earlier this month, the Trump administration released a list of people and companies who were expected to attend a dinner at the White House about the construction project. While no full list of donors has been released, the names of some companies scheduled to attend the dinner released by the White House largely come from the tech and crypto industries, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft, along with Coinbase, Ripple and Tether. Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, two tech and cryptocurrency investors, were also on the list. Some companies have already reaped lucrative contracts during Trump's second term, including Microsoft and Google which landed contracts for their AI and cloud tools, while Amazon Web Services received potentially up to $1 billion in cloud-credit incentives. The crypto industry at large has seen major benefits under Trump through policies and executive orders, with Trump's own family amassing billions through crypto ventures during his second term. Other companies, like Palantir and Lockheed Martin, have billions in contracts with the Trump administration, including the Defense Department. "We're also working with the military on it because they want to make sure everything is perfect," Trump said Wednesday evening of the ballroom construction project. "And the military is very much involved in this. They want to make sure everything is absolutely beautiful." While the White House has not been transparent about how exactly the project will be paid through donations, the money appears to be going to the project in different ways. For example, according to court documents, Google's parent Alphabet noted in a recent legal settlement reached with Trump after he was banned from YouTube following Jan. 6, 2021, that it would be contributing $22 million to help build the White House ballroom. The settlement noted that the $22 million will be contributed on Trump's behalf "to the Trust for the National Mall, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt entity dedicated to restoring, preserving, and elevating the National Mall, to support the construction of the White House State Ballroom." Paolo Tiramani, CEO of a construction company and a donor on the White House list, donated $10 million in stock to the Trust for the National Mall, his company confirmed in a statement. Donations for the ballroom are made to the Trust for the National Mall, a nonprofit that supports the National Park Service and is dedicated to the restoration of the National Mall and the White House and Presidents Park. The financial director of Trump's 2024 campaign, Meredith O'Rourke, is leading the donor effort for the ballroom, sources told ABC News. The Trust's role in the project is to manage donations while the National Park Service and the White House are leading the design and construction. The renovation project is more extensive than Trump had previously let on. A preservation group has asked the White House to pause the ballroom project, but the White House expects the entire East Wing to be demolished as soon as this weekend as part of the renovation. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reportedly plans to spend billions to automate its warehouses. Thousands of employees will soon find themselves out of work. The New York Times got ahold of confidential Amazon documents that indicate the company plans to automate huge numbers of tasks that are done by people. Robots will take over their workload. Management also told its board that it expects a surge in orders, reaching twice the current level by 2033. “Robots” is another word for AI-based automation that can replace most of the people who work in its massive warehouses. These are central to Amazon’s ability to deliver items to customers in one or two days. By most estimates, Amazon has 350 warehouses worldwide and another 1,200 logistics facilities. The Times quoted Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has a Nobel Prize in economics. He said, “Nobody else has the same incentive as Amazon to find a way to automate.” To accomplish this, the company’s e-commerce division will need nearly a million robots. Presumably, the plan will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Amazon indeed has a powerful incentive to set up a more automated system. Its North American e-commerce margins are thin. In the most recent quarter, revenue for the region was $100 billion and operating income was $7.5 billion. Amazon is uniquely positioned for the plan. It is among the early leaders in artificial intelligence. Up against Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and OpenAI, it plans to invest $100 billion in the technology this year. That is a staggering amount, even for the second-largest company in the United States as measured by revenue. It can recoup at least some of that AI investment by significantly cutting its e-commerce workforce.

Title: Samsung’s new XR headset is secretly a Pixel

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 22, 2025 Last week, I got to spend some time with Samsung’s newest device, a mixed reality headset called the Galaxy XR. This is the “Project Moohan” product Samsung has been working on for ages to take on the Apple Vision Pro. It’s an important launch for the company, and it’s even priced to compete — well, sort of. At $1,799, it’s about half the price of Apple’s headset, which is certainly good news, but still a massive amount of money. I’ve already talked extensively about what the Galaxy XR is and what it’s like to use it. In this article, though, I want to talk about something I realized almost immediately after my demo with the headset: this isn’t really a Samsung device. I know, that sounds weird. It has the word “Galaxy” in its name, and the hardware is clearly the result of Samsung’s incredible manufacturing and engineering. But the soul of the machine, the actual experience of using it? That’s all Google. When I hear “Samsung Galaxy,” I have a very clear set of expectations. I expect to see things like One UI, Samsung’s heavy-handed-but-feature-packed Android skin. I expect to find Samsung-made apps, Galaxy AI features, and maybe even a stray Bixby command. Hell, I at least expect to see the words “Samsung” or “Galaxy” somewhere on the device itself. That is not what this is. What I used felt less like a Samsung product and more like the first-ever Google Pixel XR headset, one that Samsung just happened to build. During my demo session with the Galaxy XR, I was looking for traces of One UI. I was waiting for the familiar app icons, the Samsung settings menu, and yeah, even the bloatware. They never came. This got me thinking about the Galaxy XR keynote launch, and I realized there were no Samsung apps or features mentioned there, either. Instead, everything I saw was Google. It seemed as pure and untouched as the software on a Google Pixel phone. Honestly, this was bizarre. Using a $1,799 Samsung device without any real Samsung presence in the software felt almost wrong. To be clear, everything was perfectly functional, but just not what I expected. Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? In fact, the Google experiences are what literally define this product. If you compare the Galaxy XR ($1799.99 at Samsung) to the Meta Quest 3 ($499.99 at Best Buy) or the Apple Vision Pro ($3499 at Apple), you’ll see a lot of crossover, such as with the core design, hand-tracking controls, etc. What the Galaxy XR offers that the other two don’t come directly from Google: Gemini and Google Play. Let me start with the Play Store. Since Android lives at the core of Android XR (obviously — it’s in the name), pretty much every app and game available on the Play Store right now will work straight out of the box. There will be exceptions, of course, such as with anything that requires a phone-shaped device or a physical display. But 99% of the Play Store is already working on the Galaxy XR, giving it a huge leg up over something like the Meta Quest 3. And then there’s Gemini. When Google announced Android XR late last year, it said this was the first OS designed from the ground up for the “Gemini era.” It wasn’t kidding. Gemini isn’t just an app you launch when you want it; it’s woven into the OS. This makes the Galaxy XR the first (and, as far as I can tell, only) XR headset on the market that is built for AI. During my demo, I could access Gemini anytime by holding down the multi-function button on the top right of the headset. The familiar Gemini interface popped right up. I could talk directly with it about whatever, as usual, but the real trick is that Gemini could see everything that I saw. This was helpful during the software demos, such as when I was in Google Photos. I could ask about what was in the photo, when it was taken, or to identify anyone in it. Samsung also showed off a demo of Gemini helping a gamer by checking out what they were playing and giving them tips on how to succeed. And remember that the headset can also “see” the real world through a low-latency, full-color video stream. This enables you to not only ask Gemini about what it sees in VR but also what it sees around you in reality. You can even use Circle to Search in this mode. The rest of my demo was basically a greatest-hits tour of Google’s apps, remixed for mixed reality. All this was incredible, but at the end of the demo, I asked the Samsung rep helping me out, “So, where are all the Samsung apps? Where’s One UI?” I got a very polite, very corporate non-answer: “For today, we’re just focusing on these incredible Google-powered experiences.” So yeah, they’re not there. Maybe they’ll be added later, or maybe they’ll even be there when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box, but I doubt it. If that were true, why weren’t they shown to me? In the end, this device feels like it’s 80% Google, 15% Samsung, and 5% Qualcomm. That isn’t a criticism — I’m not saying the headset is bad. It’s just that my limited experience with it left me feeling like Samsung is just acting as the manufacturer for Google’s own flagship XR ambitions. And this all gives me a serious case of déjà vu. It reminds me of 2011. For those of you who weren’t obsessing over Android back then, Samsung and Google partnered on a legendary phone: the Galaxy Nexus. The Nexus branding was Google’s “stock” Android label that predated Pixel, which eventually replaced it. The phone had Samsung’s absolutely incredible hardware — it was one of the first phones with a big, beautiful HD AMOLED screen — but it ran pure, stock Android. There was no clunky TouchWiz skin, which was what Samsung’s software was called back in those days. It was the “Google Experience Phone,” but it was built by Samsung. That is exactly what the Galaxy XR is. In that sense, one could look at this as the spiritual successor to the Galaxy Nexus, like the Nexus of mixed reality. However, Google hasn’t used the Nexus branding in years, so all that’s left is to call this what I think it actually is: the Pixel XR. The only question left is whether anyone will buy it. The Apple Vision Pro has been a well-known bomb (by Apple standards, anyway). Apple couldn’t convince the world to buy a $3,500 face computer. Samsung and Google are betting that “half the price” is the magic number. But $1,799 is still an enormous amount of money for a device that, for now, seems like a very cool, very expensive toy for gaming and looking at 3D maps. I remain cautiously optimistic. I want this to succeed. But as it stands right now, the most interesting thing about Samsung’s new headset is how little Samsung is in it. Thank you for being part of our community.

Title: Inside Superstar Investor Cathie Wood's AI Stock-Fueled Comeback
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/hanktucker/2025/10/22/inside-superstar-investor-cathie-woods-ai-stock-fueled-comeback/
Time Published: 2025-10-22T10:30:00Z

ByHank Tucker, Forbes Staff. Among all the growth-minded investors who have seen their portfolios soar through this year’s AI craze, one familiar name has outperformed the rest. Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) is up 87.1% in the last year, outperforming every other ETF and mutual fund tracked by the American Association of Individual Investors as of the end of September aside from single-stock funds. Its gains have been largely fueled by AI-related stocks like Palantir Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, Tempus AI, and its longtime largest holding, Tesla, which Wood tells Forbes is the “largest AI project on earth,” marveling at its work developing robotaxis. The last time Wood was riding this high following her flagship fund’s 157% return in 2020, her idealism and stubborn conviction soon backfired, leading to a 14% loss in 2021 and a dreadful 67% crash in 2022. Even after it has tripled since then, it remains 42% below its February 2021 peak. The flagship fund has $8.3 billion in assets under management, down from $17 billion at the end of 2020, signaling that most investors abandoned her fund during its slide. Wood dismisses any notion that she is being swept up in another bubble like the Covid-19 stock surge. “The companies investing in AI are some of the most profitable companies in the world,” says Wood. “The reasoning models are astounding people in terms of how much more they can do if you give these models time. I think there were a lot of people expecting at some point the performance would level out. It's not leveling out at all.” Almost every AI stock has performed well this year, but Wood, Ark’s 69-year-old founder, CEO and chief investment officer, has had a nose for the biggest winners even relative to their peers. Ark owns more AMD than larger competitor Nvidia, two semiconductor stocks that make up 4.0% and 1.1% of ARKK’s portfolio, respectively, a prescient choice with AMD doubling in value this year compared to Nvidia’s more modest 36% gain. Wood says AMD’s lower valuation at less than $400 billion, while Nvidia’s market cap is $4.4 trillion, makes its growth prospects more appealing, and its superiority in chips with more expansive memory is becoming more of a differentiator. Palantir has done far better, gaining 337% since last November. Its data analytics technology helps government agencies and commercial customers blend and find patterns in massive datasets, and its 12-month sales have grown 39% year over year to $3.4 billion, with $763 in net profit. But Palantir is the poster child for the AI stock bubble, according to most value oriented investors. Its $430 billion market cap is a jaw-dropping 126 times its sales. Though Wood has taken profits in Palantir, selling 70% of Ark’s stake since August 2024, it still makes up 4.2% of its flagship fund as its ninth-largest holding. “If Palantir were not at its current valuation, given its position in the platform-as-a-service space, and we think they effectively own that space, it would be right up there with Tesla [in our portfolio],” says Wood, referencing her firm’s 11.9% holding in the electric vehicle giant. “There’s nothing like it out there.” That’s high praise from Wood, who has loved and owned Tesla for almost a decade. It was a key contributor to her 2020 performance with its 731% gain that year, then it mirrored her fund’s crash in 2022, losing 68%. Last year, Ark raised its price target for the stock to $2,600 per share by 2029, implying a market value of around $9 trillion. Tesla shares currently trade for $443 and has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. Ark estimates that by 2029 86% of Tesla’s earnings will be attributable to its robotaxi business, which it just launched in Austin, Texas this June. “EVs are one and done—you sell a car and hope the customer comes back in five years, and they're very low margin,” says Wood. “When analysts look at what robotaxis are, they have to use a different model. It's more of a subscription or recurring revenue model, and it's very high margin.” With $1 billion in ARKK invested in Tesla, the holding is twice the weight of its second largest position, Coinbase, but aside from that investment, Wood generally doesn’t invest very much in $1 trillion market-cap tech giants. Amazon, Meta and Nvidia are all in her portfolio, but not in the top 15. Avoiding mega tech stocks but doubling down on the smaller-cap stocks turned out to be a grave mistake for Wood in 2022. Virtual health business Teladoc Health lost 88% in 2021 and 2022. Game development firm Unity Software fell 80% in 2022. Bets on biotech and life sciences firms like Ginkgo Bioworks, Exact Sciences, Beam Therapeutics and Intellia Therapeutics all floundered. “We had no idea that we were going to run into a buzzsaw. Many people think it was interest rates, and sure, all long duration assets got killed,” Wood reflects. “But our bigger problem was the supply chain shocks that lingered for so long. Because what drives our models is unit growth. The more unit growth, the faster costs can decline with new technologies.” In hindsight, Wood concedes the “correct thing to do” would have been to find shelter in larger-cap innovators that were more resilient to supply chain issues and rising interest rates, but she thinks today’s policy environment is far more favorable to her strategy. A longtime Donald Trump supporter, she applauds his move in January to rescind parts of a Joe Biden executive order that aimed to set some standards for AI regulation. New depreciation schedules in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act have also eased corporate tax burdens. “The amount of deregulation that is taking place in this administration is astonishing,” she gushes. “I don't like tariffs, but I would take tariffs if you also gave me what this administration has given with deregulation and much lower tax rates.” What investors think of Wood depends largely on when they invested. ARKK’s 31.8% three-year annualized return as of September 30 is better than the S&P 500 Index’s 24.9% figure, but its -0.8% five-year number looks terrible compared to the market’s 16.5% annual gains. But rewinding further, a 15.3% annual return since inception in 2014 is back to outperforming the market by two percentage points. It trails the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 16.9% annualized returns in that span, but it’s narrowing that gap. It’s hard for any investor to come back from an 80% loss from peak to trough, but the Nasdaq similarly lost close to 80% during the dotcom bust, and has gained about 2,000% in the quarter century since. Wood is hopeful that decades from now, its 2022 collapse will similarly look like a blip on ARRK’s long-term stock chart.

Title: Samsung Galaxy XR hands-on: Just the opening act

Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more. October 21, 2025 For nearly a year, Samsung has been hyping up a new XR headset, previously known as Project Moohan. Now, finally, we know everything there is to know about the device, which is officially called the Samsung Galaxy XR. It’s the product of a massive collaboration between Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm, and it’s packed with impressive tech. I got to spend some time with the device at Samsung’s New York City launch event last week, and I want to say something a little unexpected, something I noticed after testing it. While Samsung clearly wants to sell as many of these as possible — it is a business chasing profit, after all — it was also made clear to me at the keynote that the well-known Apple Vision Pro sales failure is hanging heavy over this launch. In fact, this is one of the few launches I’ve ever been to in which the presenters actively told us that this product is “just the beginning” and that better things are on the way. So that leads us to the big question, which is whether or not you will actually buy this $1,799 headset. And let me tell you a secret: I think Samsung isn’t expecting you to. After my hands-on demo, it was clear that this headset is likely a foundational product designed to pave the way for the real revolution: future smart glasses powered by Android XR. Before I get into all that, though, let me tell you about the headset. If you’ve ever used a VR headset before, there are no real surprises here. The Galaxy XR hasn’t changed all that much from when it was first shown off as a prototype way back in December 2024. It has a glass front that protects multiple cameras and sensors. There are thick straps that connect the main headset to the back padding, which has a big dial on it for tightening or loosening the straps. There are three buttons on the headset: a multi-function button on the top right, and then a volume rocker on the top left. It was comfortable to wear, and it comes with removable light blockers that can help you be more immersed in your content by blocking off your peripheral vision. Conversely, you can remove them to keep yourself grounded in the real world (and hopefully offset any VR dizziness). Don’t want to miss the best from Android Authority? Like Apple’s Vision Pro, the battery is not built into the headset. Instead, it’s a self-contained pack (see below) that connects to the device using a proprietary pin system. You can keep the battery in your pocket or rest it on the couch next to you while you are immersed in the VR world. The reason the Galaxy XR is designed this way is to keep that hefty battery weight off your head, which should make it more comfortable to use it for extended periods. According to Samsung, you should be able to get about two hours of use based on one battery pack charge. There’s been no word on whether or not you’ll be able to buy additional battery packs. Inside the headset are two displays (3,552 x 3,840 at 60Hz, 72Hz, or 90Hz) that automatically adjust themselves based on your face. This is made possible thanks to multiple sensors and cameras inside that perform eye-tracking functions. This means you don’t need to fiddle with knobs or move the lenses around to get the right focus — the headset does all the adjustments for you. For audio, there are small speakers above your ears that blast the sound out. This allows you to avoid wearing headphones and also lets you still hear the real world around you. Of course, if you’d prefer to use Bluetooth headphones, that’s totally fine, as the headset supports Bluetooth connections of all kinds, including earbuds, gaming controllers, mice and keyboards, and more. Unfortunately, the Galaxy XR doesn’t come with any of that stuff. When you buy it, you just get the headset and the battery pack. Samsung has made VR-style controllers specifically for the Galaxy XR, but they are an additional purchase. The fact that the headset doesn’t come with controllers is not such a big deal, though, as Google and Samsung want you to use your hands and your voice for controls all the time. So how do you use it without controllers? This is where the magic of the device really becomes apparent. Outside the headset, multiple cameras and sensors track everything your hands do in real-time. There are lots of downward-facing cameras on the front that capture your hand motions. Using these, you can control the operating system with hand gestures. A pinch acts as a left mouse click, and a pinch and hold acts as holding down the left mouse button, so you can drag windows around. You can use two hands to pinch to zoom in and out. Turning your hand around and pinching opens menus. Meanwhile, the eye-tracking cameras inside are monitoring your eyes at all times. This allows you to simply look at something and the headset understands what you’re looking at, which makes controlling things faster and easier. With this combination of hand- and eye-tracking, you can manipulate things in your VR environment without needing to hold a controller or have any sort of apparatus on your hands or wrists. The headset also offers opportunities for augmented reality experiences. The real world can be projected into the headset in full color with very low latency. Using Circle to Search, you could circle pretty much anything in the real world and do a search for it. Of course, you probably wouldn’t be caught dead wearing this around town, but it is fully wireless, so you could if you wanted to. The Galaxy XR hardware is all Samsung, but the software — known as Android XR — is all Google. As its name suggests, this is based on Android, so it works very similarly to what you’ve been using on your phones and tablets for nearly two decades. I expected it to come with something like One UI on board with a distinctly Samsung-ified look and feel, but instead, all I saw everywhere was Google apps in their usual stock style. There was nothing in the software that said Samsung at all, at least nothing that was shown in the keynote or demoed for me during my session. Every single thing was Google this and Google that. Where’s Galaxy AI? Where’s One UI? Where are the Samsung apps? Where’s Bixby? Regardless, because Android XR is based on Android, nearly every app and game on the Play Store will automatically work with the headset. It will present the app in its native format in a 2D window, and you can use it as normal. However, we do have a lot of unanswered questions about the OS. Will it be available to any company that wants to make a headset, just like Android is available to any company that wants to make a phone? How much will companies be able to customize it? How often will devices get updates? I asked a Google rep about all this, and they said that the company would announce all that in due time. So what is it actually like using this thing? At its core, the Galaxy XR is simply a VR headset with multiple opportunities for entertainment. The two most significant differentiators from the competition are its gaming prowess and the deep integration of Google’s Gemini. If you’re a gamer, you should know that this headset is going to be much better for gaming than the Apple Vision Pro and maybe even the Meta Quest 3. It will support Steam VR games when connected to a VR-ready PC and will also support 2D games through existing apps like Steam Link and Moonlight. It will also support pretty much every game on the Google Play Store. Connecting a standard controller to the headset via Bluetooth is dead simple. As mentioned earlier, you’ll be able to get VR-style controllers from Samsung as an additional purchase, opening the doors to all sorts of existing VR games. Apple made a big mistake by not working hard to support these kinds of experiences with the Vision Pro, so it’s great to see Google and Samsung aren’t making the same mistake. Even more significant than gaming, though, is Gemini. When Google announced Android XR at the end of 2024, it specifically called out that it was the first operating system designed from the ground up for what it calls the Gemini era. In other words, Android XR was built with Gemini already in mind. As such, it permeates everywhere throughout the operating system. You can activate Gemini at any time by holding down the multi-function button. This allows you to not only speak to Gemini but also easily show it your display, allowing you to ask questions about what you’re doing. For example, you could be playing a game and pull up Gemini to help you out with it. You wouldn’t need to explain anything to it, because it would be able to see the game, what level you’re on, your character’s health, and all that. If you have a bunch of windows open within your virtual environment, you can just ask Gemini to organize them for you. The really cool thing is that you can do this conversationally using Gemini Live; you don’t need to say “Hey Gemini” all the time. The demos I tried really hammered home how central Gemini is to the experience. The first thing I saw was Google Photos. The app looks and works just like it does on your phone, but the software can make any photo stereoscopic, which means it appears to have depth. You can easily turn this on or off with any photo in your library, and the depth effect is created on-device on the fly. Gemini works here for helping you find specific photos without needing to scroll through. Just say, “Show me my photos from our trip to France, Gemini.” After Google Photos, we jumped into Google Maps. You start out with an aerial view of the Earth, as if you were floating in space. You can then tell Gemini to take you anywhere you like, and you’ll zoom into that area, floating above it like a bird. You can then zoom in even further to explore places in street view, so it feels like you’re walking around the destination. Here, you can have a chat with Gemini as you’re exploring. Let’s say you spot a landmark; you can simply look at it and ask Gemini about it, and the AI will tell you whatever you want to know. The really cool thing, though, is you can actually walk inside select buildings. Google does this by using AI to stitch together existing photos and videos available on Google Maps, creating a realistic 3D environment. There are already over 1,000 locations in New York that work for this, such as the restaurant in the video below. Finally, we tried YouTube. I viewed an immersive 360-degree video shot specifically for headsets like the Galaxy XR, as well as an interactive 3D film where I could reach out and “touch” objects. I also watched one of my own videos that was automatically converted to be stereoscopic, which was pretty cool. However, that specific feature will not work when you take the Galaxy XR out of the box. Eventually, it will work on most YouTube videos, but it will be a while before it’s active. The Samsung Galaxy XR starts at $1,799, which is literally half the price of the Apple Vision Pro. While this definitely makes the device more affordable, $1,800 is still very, very expensive. This isn’t a tech product you just decide to buy one day. The Vision Pro has also been a well-established bomb for Apple, with sales figures estimated to be less than one million units. Samsung might be undercutting Apple on price by a wide margin, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s launching into a market that even Apple, the master of busting up existing markets, couldn’t crack. This is why I think the Galaxy XR is just an opening act. The real revolution will be smart glasses that do most of the things the Galaxy XR can do, but do it in the real world. We know this is coming, too, because Samsung and Google are already hyping them up with partnerships with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster. If Samsung and its partners can make smart glasses that allow you to bring Android XR with you wherever you go and include an AI companion that can jump in and help you whenever needed, it could have a revolution on its hands. The Galaxy XR seems like a terrific product, but it’s still, at its core, just another VR headset. Most people who buy this will use it to play games and watch movies in their homes, by themselves. That doesn’t add up to a device that changes your life — that adds up to a TV screen you attach to your face. The idea that you can already do that with existing devices— and have been able to for a decade — makes this feel less like a revolutionary new product and more like a way-too-late entry into a plateaued market. So, will you buy the Galaxy XR? Or will you wait for the real revolution, which will be future smart glasses with Android XR on board? Based on what I saw, this is a very impressive tech demo that serves as a foundation for something much greater. It’s a device that feels designed to get developers and early adopters hooked on the Android XR ecosystem. But, in the end, all it’s doing is preparing them for the main event that’s still to come.

Title: The 3 Best Growth Stocks To Buy For November 2025

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Applied Digital is a rapidly expanding AI data center operator, securing large contracts and building new capacity to meet soaring demand.Broadcom is a strong contender in AI infrastructure, providing innovative, cost-effective custom AI chips that outperform competitors.Eli Lilly dominates the booming diabetes- and obesity-drug markets with blockbuster products and has a robust pipeline of new treatments. It's tough to say for sure which growth stocks will be winners without a crystal ball. But investors may wish to consider investing in AI data center operator Applied Digital, AI semiconductor provider Broadcom and the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly. These three companies have solid prospects for gains in addition to some better-known companies, such as Nvidia and Palantir. Applied Digital, Broadcom and Lilly have the potential to rise in the short and long term. If they beat earnings targets and raise guidance, their share prices will keep rising. If they tap their strong competitive positions to win more market share, they'll see lasting success. These stocks were selected based on their rapid growth, good chance of exceeding expectations, and strong products and management. If a company is growing rapidly now and has a track record of beating expectations, its stock is likely to rise. However, to sustain those increases over time, a company must innovate. If the company has great products and excellent management, better-than-expected growth is more likely to last. The three best growth stocks are ranked below in descending order of their stock price change in 2025 as of Oct. 21. More generally, the three stocks are ranked from the highest to lowest return and risk. Read on to learn why. Although it is not profitable, Applied Digital has grown rapidly. In the company's first quarter of fiscal 2026, revenue increased 84% to $64.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations by $14.2 million, CNBC reported. Applied Digital is benefiting from soaring demand for AI data centers. An estimated $350 billion will be spent in 2025 by large cloud services providers called hyperscalers. CoreWeave – a leading AI cloud services provider – recently leased 150 megawatts of Applied Digital’s Polaris Forge 1 campus, bringing Applied Digital’s total anticipated contracted lease revenue to about $11 billion over 15 years, CNBC also reported. Strong demand for Applied Digital’s services looks likely to continue at least through 2026. That's one reason, the company is building a 200 megawatt Polaris Forge 2 campus and is in “advanced discussions with hyperscalers,” according to CRN, with management projecting leased capacity for both Applied Digital campuses as high as 600 MW. Broadcom is benefiting from demand for AI infrastructure. In the company’s third quarter of fiscal year 2025, AI semiconductor revenue grew 53% to $5.2 billion. The company is also gaining from a shift in AI chip architecture through Broadcom’s 65% revenue share of application-specific integrated circuits for hyperscalers, according to Ainvest. Broadcom provides hyperscalers with AI chips that deliver faster performance at lower prices than Nvidia’s products. The chip provider’s clients include Google, Meta, ByteDance and reportedly OpenAI, “representing a strategic alternative to purchasing Nvidia's GPUs," CNBC said. More specifically, Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators deliver three to five times better performance-per-watt than Nvidia GPUs at a roughly $20,000 to $15,000 lower per unit cost, Datagravity estimated. Such innovation has enabled Broadcom to exceed Wall Street expectations for eight consecutive quarters, typically resulting in 10% to 20% stock increases on earnings-announcement days, Ainvest reported. Broadcom’s stock price could rise in November. A September announcement of a $10 billion order for the Titan AI inference chip from a fourth hyperscale customer— believed to be OpenAI —demonstrates Broadcom is winning new hyperscale customers. Though this program is scheduled to begin in the third quarter of fiscal year 2026, pre-production revenue and additional design wins could emerge in fourth-quarter 2025 results, Tom's Hardware predicted. Eli Lilly is an American pharmaceutical company combining strong profitability and rapid growth with its market-leading diabetes and obesity treatments. Lilly’s latest financial results, in the second quarter of 2025 showed that revenue rose 38% to $15.56 billion, with net income increasing 91% to nearly $6.7 billion, according to a company release. Lilly dominates the market for diabetes and weight loss drugs. More specifically, Lilly controls about 57% of the U.S. market for incretins – enjoying a competitive advantage over rival Novo Nordisk, Reuters reported. Lilly has experienced rapid growth in demand for two drugs: Mounjaro, which helps manage blood-sugar levels in adults with diabetes, and Zepbound, for treating obesity and weight-related conditions. In Q2, sales of these products grew 68% to $5.2 billion for Mounjaro and 172% to nearly $3.4 billion for Zepbound. The company communicated its optimism about future growth, raising its full-year 2025 guidance above Wall Street expectations. It's projecting $60 billion to $62 billion in revenue and EPS between $21.75 and $23.00 amid strong demand. A new obesity treatment called retatrutide, which is expected to report positive trial results late in 2025, provides another reason for optimism, Pharmaceutical-Journal noted. Moreover, An Alzheimer’s therapy called donanemab, sold under the brand name Kisunla, was approved in 2025 and could help Lilly exceed investor’s revenue expectations. Investors looking for stocks with upside potential may consider betting on shares of Applied Digital, Broadcom and Eli Lilly. While Applied Digital is losing money and investing to build capacity, its rapid revenue growth and feverish demand from hyperscalers makes it a compelling short-term investment. Broadcom is a much larger, profitable beneficiary of AI chip demand while Lilly’s commanding lead in the booming markets for treatment of diabetes and obesity is propelling rapid growth, which could be even faster if the company shares positive results from new drug trials.

Hyman is an economist and financial analyst specializing in the energy sector. He headed utility equity research at a major brokerage house and… More Info Here is a funny thing about valuation “bubbles” involving financial instruments. In every individual case, you unavoidably end up asking: "What were they thinking?” Or stated differently, what causes a significant part of the supposedly rational investing public to collectively lose their minds for a relatively brief period? A few tulip bulbs, for example, were valued more highly than a modest Amsterdam house in 1637, until they weren’t. Leveraged speculation in frontier commodity markets of Asia and America led to the South Sea Bubble and the Mississippi Bubble in Europe in the 1720s. The seventeenth and eighteenth-century bubbles were commodity bubbles: tulips, spices, or beaver pelts. But the Railway Mania in the UK in the mid-1840s focused on an amazing new technology, railroads, marketed to the public as risk-free investments. That the British railroad companies' shares ultimately soared and then lost more than two-thirds of their value, immiserating a large portion of the investing public, is almost besides the point. Bubbles always end badly by definition. But the UK’s railway mania is instructive because it was the first truly modern bubble which had all three components of more recent financial bubbles: 1) a new technology, railroads for moving goods and people, the long term economic impacts of which are unclear; 2) financial innovation usually involving leverage or speculation and 3) a government that either participates in the scheme or has little inclination to intervene in financial markets (until it’s too late). Related: Tanker Explosion Off Yemen Deepens Red Sea Security Fears for LPG Trade Using this as a framework, it seems fair to ask if today’s AI stocks, which have substantially outperformed broad market indices, are in a financial bubble? But we’re utility analysts asking this question for a simple reason. The demands for new electric power-generating facilities supposedly required by AI are simply staggering both in amount and expense. For example, the highly respected Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) expects new AI-related electricity demand to reach 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030. A Deloitte study showed AI electric demand increasing from 4GW now to 123 GW by 2035. And Sam Altman’s Open AI Consortium (including Softbank and Oracle) stated it would need roughly 250 GW by 2033, which at today’s prices would cost over half a trillion bucks to build. (To put these numbers in context, total generating capacity in the USA, presently, is 1,300 GW, growing about 30 GW per year.) All we can say is that with respect to power costs, the AI industry is behaving as if they are either irrelevant or simply a modest expense item, neither of which is true. Utility assets and AI data centers resemble each other in that both are highly capital-intensive, but with one big difference. The heart of a utility is a power plant that lasts forty years (an annual depreciation rate of 2.5%). The primary cost component of a data center is the vast array of computer chips, which have a relatively short life, maybe 2-3 years. A capital asset with a two-year life has a 50% depreciation rate, creating a very large expense item on the income statement, which has to be covered by revenues from the business or by increased corporate borrowing. That still doesn’t make the AI/data center boom a bubble, but it does suggest our next concern. Capital expenditures for AI and data centers seem high. Not just to us. In fact, economists have noted that in the first half of 2025, AI-related capital expenditures contributed more to US domestic growth than consumer spending. This marks a dramatic reversal of prior trends, where consumer spending has been responsible for the bulk of economic activity. All we can conclude here is that this highlights the biggest financial risk for AI investors: will all these new facilities earn a competitive return on all this new, invested capital? Will there be enough revenues to support these new assets? We know the level of planned capex and that there are exciting uses for this technology. We do not know how much people will pay for these services, and therein lies a huge risk. This boom (bubble?) reminds us of the power-generating bubble that burst in the early days of the century. When the power generating market was opened to competition, a host of legacy electricity firms, bankers, entrepreneurs, pipelines, European utilities, and crooks piled in to build a multitude of power plants, encouraged by favorable forward price curves and plenty of low-cost borrowed money. They knew that all the construction (if completed) would produce a power glut, but they all believed that the other guy would back down and not build, thereby preventing an oversupply. Well, the other guys did not back down, demand for power was weak, and carnage followed. There are other related risks here, such as the role of vendor financing. The biggest players in this area (Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Nvidia) are financially robust. But they support an ecosystem of smaller vendors and suppliers who rely exclusively for their infrastructure and software on the aforementioned giants. This creates a circular financing scheme where one group sells products to another wholly captive or financially dependent group while purchasing their services. In a bubble, this is all financed with common stock issuances at ever higher valuations. Which works until it doesn’t. Then the house of cards falls down, as it did in the housing and dot-com bubbles earlier this century. The AI boom assumes that the tech bros in California, choosing an AI strategy, picked the right horse. The Chinese seem to think otherwise, offering less expensive AI solutions to less expensive problems, more or less. Chinese industry has shown, with government help, a remarkable ability to take ideas from abroad and commercialize them into a lower-cost product. AI is in their targets. That may put these huge American AI investments at risk. So don’t start to count the profits. Let’s conclude with these observations about financial bubbles. First, there is a kind of conflation in the term between genuinely nonsensical ideas and those viable corporations whose shares were simply grossly misvalued. When the dot-com bubble burst around the year 2000, the shares of Amazon declined by over 90%. But it is still around, bigger than ever. Pet food supplier Pets.com, on the other hand, which lost money on every sale, is not. If we go back to our original example of the British railway mania of the 1840s, we can observe something similar. Those railroads, which provided an enormous economic boost to a rapidly industrializing British economy, also caused grievous financial injury to a generation of investors because of the wild misvaluation of the fledgling industry employing a radically new technology, the steam engine. But the legacy of that technology bubble was a fully functioning national railway system that still exists. So, after this AI and data center investor euphoria passes, the investors lose their money and the smoke lifts, what remains, just ashes or many valuable, profitable, important businesses?

Title: The Jio tariff hike everyone expected isn’t coming—yet

Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, India’s largest telecom operator by market share, has no immediate plans to increase mobile phone tariffs, belying market expectations, choosing instead to grow revenue by driving users to consume more data. Jio and its closest rival Bharti Airtel Ltd recently removed their entry-level plans to bump up their average revenue per user (or Arpu, a key performance metric for telecom operators), triggering expectations that the telecom operators would increase tariffs towards the end of the year or in early 2026. “We are nudging consumers to consume more and happily pay more, but no immediate plans for the tariff (hike)," said Anshuman Thakur, head of strategy at Reliance Jio Infocomm, during an earnings call with analysts. In the September quarter, Jio’s monthly average revenue per user rose 1.2% to ₹211.4 from ₹208.8 at the end of June, with growth slowing due to promotional 5G offers, according to the company. Following Jio’s decision to remove its entry-level pack, analysts had expected it to both raise tariffs and focus on premium services to close the gap with Bharti Airtel, which leads the industry in terms of Arpu ( ₹250 at the end of June). Airtel is yet to declare its September-quarter earnings. “If Reliance were not to increase tariffs in the next few months, its [year-on-year] Arpu growth for the March quarter would likely be 4% (at say ₹214/subscriber)," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note dated 19 October. “Investors continue to expect Jio to raise telecom tariffs ahead of the proposed IPO of Reliance Jio (likely by June 2026)." Jio net added 8.3 million mobile subscribers during the September quarter, taking its subscriber base to 506.4 million. At the end of September, Jio had 234 million 5G subscribers, up from 213 million in the preceding June quarter. 5G now accounts for 50% of Jio’s total wireless traffic. Leading tariff hikesWhen telecom operators raised tariffs in July 2024 after a gap of over two years, it was Reliance Jio that took the lead with a 12–25% price hike. But while Airtel and Vodafone Idea Ltd have been vocal about the need to hike tariffs to increase the return on capital employed (RoCE, a measure of profitability and efficiency), Jio has refrained from openly talking about increasing tariffs. “We (the industry) are operating with the lowest Arpus and the lowest rate per gigabyte. Yet you have to make money," Bharti Airtel’s managing director and vice chairman Gopal Vittal said at an industry event earlier this month, adding that there was room for raising telecom tariffs. In fact, Vittal had earlier called for a change in the telecom tariff structure, by reducing data allowances on some telecom packs and charging for more data. “Though RIL (Reliance Industries) is non-committal on possible tariff hike, management indicated they have other levers like unlimited 5G slab increase, etc., to drive Arpu growth along with the accelerated roll out of FTTH (fiber-to-the-home)/FWA (fixed wireless access)," Antique Stock Broking analysts said in a note dated 19 October. Also Read | Jio Platforms IPO could see another tariff war—to hike telecom rates Jio’s broadband focusJio, during its earnings call last week, said it was looking to add more home broadband subscribers faster. It added more than 1 million new homes each month during the July-September quarter, taking its total fixed broadband connections to 23 million. Jio has set a target of 100 million home broadband customers, with no specified timeline. “The rate for connecting new homes has been increasing and the technology is working well," Thakur told analysts during the call. “A lot of these new connections are being done wirelessly, and therefore the implementation itself is simpler, faster, and we are expecting that we will be able to scale this up quite significantly from where we are today." Jio is leveraging its unlicensed band radio technology—the 5G Air Fibre and fiber route—to provide home broadband internet.

On the role of Jio’s parent, Jio Platforms Ltd, in this arrangement, Thakur said, “Jio is going to develop its own products and it is going to work with Reliance Intelligence to bring its solutions to the market." Jio Platforms houses the telecom and digital services business of Reliance Industries. Reliance Jio Infocomm is a subsidiary of Jio Platforms, accounting for most of its business. Reliance Intelligence will develop and invest in creating AI products, Thakur explained, adding that this would require a lot of infrastructure and computing needs such as graphic processing units (GPUs).

While Jio will have an open slate to work with companies such as OpenAI, Meta and Google, Reliance Intelligence will compete with these global tech giants, he said. “This dual structure—RI (Reliance Intelligence) developing core AI capabilities and Jio leveraging them across its platforms—ensures lower incremental investment needs, stronger integration, and long-term cost efficiency, positioning Reliance to monetize enterprise AI workloads and India- specific digital services in the coming years," the Antique Stock Broking analysts said in their note. Jio Platforms reported a 12.8% year-on-year growth in net profit to ₹7,375 crore for the September quarter. Revenue from operations rose 14.6% to ₹36,332 crore.
