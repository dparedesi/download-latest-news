Blockchain fragmentation and Ethereum's network challenges highlight Bitcoin's enduring appeal as a store of value. Cover art/illustration via CryptoSlate. Image includes combined content which may include AI-generated content. The following is a guest post from Shane Neagle, Editor In Chief from The Tokenist. Since the introduction of altcoins, after Bitcoin paved the road for them, we have seen many projects give 10x gains in relatively short periods. It has also been accepted that the crypto space oscillates between altcoin and bitcoin seasons, suggesting more investing opportunities down the line. A deluge of memecoins flooded the market as well, serving as a more robust gambling system (compared to online casinos). As crypto space lost $530 billion market cap over the last 30 days, it is prudent to examine its fundamentals once again. Is such a concept as ‚Äòaltcoin season‚Äô meaningful moving forward? Is there more to cryptos than cyclical speculation? To answer those questions, we must first remind ourselves of narratives past. During the evolution of the crypto space, Bitcoin became de-facto the only proof-of-work digital asset worth considering, following Ethereum‚Äôs The Merge in September 2022. As a transition from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS), The Merge represents a cleavage in blockchain philosophies. While Bitcoin‚Äôs proof-of-work (PoW) requires computational resources, Ethereum‚Äôs PoS eliminates such barriers in order to boost transaction speed and efficiency. In other words, Bitcoin further differentiated itself as a store of value, while Ethereum focused more on cost-effective blockchain utility. At first glance, this may seem perfectly complementary, but there are several underlying problems that eventually reared their heads. Altogether, the PoW-PoS bifurcation translates into PoS fragmentation. If PoS-based assets, and PoS-based platforms competitive to Ethereum, are more reproducible, they can be launched with minimal upfront costs. With this foundation, there is no single altcoin asset to cling onto. Ultimately, with a low barrier of entry, this led to the fragmentation of the crypto market across +34,000 digital assets. From the Bitcoin-Ethereum perspective, as the two largest digital assets by market cap, PoS-led fragmentation manifests as a corrosive effect on Ethereum price level. To put it differently, Bitcoin‚Äôs key features, PoW and scarcity, are reinforcing Bitcoin fundamentals. In contrast, Ethereum suffers from network effect erosion from competing PoS chains, which offer similar functionality and incentive structure. Moreover, the increased complexity outside of Bitcoin is creating a barrier to entry from new capital inflows. Who can spend time filtering thousands of assets and bet that they will have staying power beyond one year? Even sophisticated investors leveraging popular futures trading algorithms often struggle to navigate the fragmented market effectively. In fact, this is precisely why memecoin mania gained traction. The complexity and fragmentation of the crypto market lends itself to thinking of digital assets outside their fundamentals. Instead, focus is then on celebrity endorsements, humor, viral marketing, which often turns into pump-and-dump schemes. Inevitably, this creates a negative feedback loop: But there is an even greater problem than that. Let‚Äôs assume that this negative feedback loop created by memecoins doesn‚Äôt exist. One has to consider if there even is a market for blockchain based solutions, as it was previously imagined. Through anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) requirements, governments around the world have expended great efforts to subdue the crypto ecosystem. Let‚Äôs quickly remind ourselves of key promises before regulative sweeps took place: Decentralization as elimination of intermediaries ‚Äì nearly everything is now intermediated through fiat rails, including transfers from self-custodial wallets. Financial inclusion as access for the unbanked/underbanked ‚Äì it is still more convenient to use legacy banking than blockchain tech, which is inherently complex and requires digital literacy. According to the latest EMarketer report, cryptocurrency payment penetration is hitting a wall. Although the number of crypto payment users is expected to rise by 82.1% from 2024 to 2026, this is from a tiny overall population base of only 2.6%. It may very well end up being the case that a digital dollar, a stablecoin like USDT, will subsume this effort entirely in place of a direct CBDC. Censorship resistance as a guarantee that transactions cannot be reversed or intercepted by governments and organizations. Governments regularly pursue innovative mechanisms to cancel such efforts, from debanking to the persecution of smart contract developers. Although Treasury sanctions against Tornado Cash were overturned in January, there is little indication that financial privacy will become a human right any time soon. In fact, indicators point in the other direction. üö® BREAKING: The ECB‚Äôs Digital Euro is set to launch in October. Key concerns include: ‚Äì Real-time transaction tracking ‚Äì Potential for payment blocking ‚Äì Automatic tax deductions ‚Äì Restrictions on cash withdrawals ‚Äì Programmable money with expiration dates They couldn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/UvQH750gbl ‚Äî Dr. Simon Goddek (@goddeketal) March 9, 2025 Altogether, this friction between blockchain-led solutions and governments leads to a contained market. And if a blockchain-based solution should be deployed, it will be under governments‚Äô terms. Lastly, the entire concept of Web3 is dubious as a decentralized, blockchain-based iteration of the internet. Elon Musk‚Äôs DOGE revelations in the case of USAID funding clearly point to great efforts to push narratives, control narratives, suppress and de-legitimize dissent. A semantic, censorship-resistant Web3 is fundamentally at odds with governments‚Äô needs to maintain authority and legitimacy as they push various agendas. To think that established information proliferation nodes such as Google, Microsoft and Facebook would be allowed to erode in favor of Web3 would be foolhardy. Any government needs centralized nodes to maintain power. This was amply demonstrated in the case of the TikTok ban. Although this video reels app is vastly superior to YouTube shorts, a leverage was pulled to sanitize it and make it less relevant. Again, this is another factor that contains the blockchain space to a micro-niche instead of propelling it into mainstream expansion. With this in mind, blockchain space is still worthy of engagement. Bitcoin will likely remain the main focus of crypto investing, owing to its unique, PoW-based network effect. Although the recent White House Crypto Summit was less bullish than expected, it was still positive in the long run. The decision to use seized bitcoins effectively removed this sell pressure from the table. Likewise, President Trump seems to be serious about ending the ‚Äúwar on crypto‚Äù. But looking at the crypto space from a purely innovative solutions perspective, which projects should retail investors consider during steep discounts? These five tokens should be considered as long play exposure during crypto market deflation. After all, it is unlikely that AI narrative will subside any time soon. In terms of top 10 revenue-generation chains during the market slump, crypto activity is clearly on the side of low-friction payment chains (Tron) and general purpose, high-performing chains (Solana, Avalanche). Ethereum still maintains high ranking due to its large market share within the DeFi ecosystem. In conclusion, what should crypto investors keep in mind moving forward? Due to inherent friction with governments, digital assets are unlikely to ever penetrate mainstream to a significant extent. But within the contained ecosystem, investors should focus on long term narratives ‚Äì AI, infrastructure and chain performance. A truly decentralized Web3 should be understood as a niche play that will be countered by deep pockets of Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), as centralized node extensions of the USG. By the same token, retail investors would do well to expose themselves to their stock options as safer bets.

Title: An AI stock picker that beat the S&P 500 last year is dumping tech stocks ‚Äî but holding on to these Magnificent 7 firms
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/market-beating-ai-stock-picker-nvidia-tesla-tech-sell-off-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-15T12:02:01Z
Full Content:
Beating the S&P 500's 23% gain in 2024 was no easy feat, but an AI-backed ETF did just that. Qraft Technologies' AI-Enhanced US Large Cap Momentum ETF (AMOM) finished the year up 38%, thanks to big bets on growth stock winners such as Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), and Palantir (PLTR). But this year's volatile market has led the fund ‚Äî which uses machine learning models to analyze price trends in the market ‚Äî to do some severe rebalancing in March, reducing its tech exposure in a big way. AMOM runs on a machine-learning methodology called clustering, which sorts data into similar groups. The algorithm examines the price momentum of large-cap US stocks and rebalances every month, Qraft's ETF lead Justin Tam told Business Insider. "In simple terms, it means that we're looking at previous momentum to see which one is the best predictor of next month," Tam said. A tech-heavy concentration hasn't done the portfolio any favors so far in 2025, as it's down 16% year-to-date. "Going into March, it's gone really bearish on tech," Tam said of the fund. The AI model has reduced its exposure from the tech sector from over 40% last year to just 26% now. Instead of retaining its tech-heavy allocation, the algorithm has diversified more into financials and communications services, picking up companies like Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS). The AI fund hasn't completely exited or reduced all of its Big Tech holdings in March, though. In fact, three of its four largest holdings are Magnificent Seven stocks: Nvidia (9.41%), Meta Platforms (6.95%), and Tesla (5.19%). Even though Nvidia beat Wall Street expectations with its earnings report in February of this year, its stock has taken a beating from macroeconomic volatility and technological developments in the AI space. But Tam remains confident in the stock. "We do see a lot of signs for optimism in terms of the long-term growth for Nvidia and the AI trade in general, seeing as the data center revenue has stayed steady, which means that the mega-caps are still investing heavily in AI development," Tam said. As for Tesla, the stock has seen a 48% decline since its mid-December peak, leaving investors uneasy. However, the fund is still holding on, with a 6% allocation to the electric carmaker. "We've seen it pick names that we couldn't make sense of and have it pay off quite a lot," Tam said of the fund's AI algorithm. AI isn't alone in betting on Tesla ‚Äî the company has supporters on Wall Street, too. Morgan Stanley is overweight on the stock and has classified the company as a top US auto stock pick. The bank isn't too worried about Tesla's decreased sales. "Tesla's softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive 'pure play' to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics," Adam Jones, an equity analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note earlier this month.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (‚ÄúAppLovin‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin‚Äôs financial growth and stability. Defendants‚Äô statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin‚Äôs launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using ‚Äúcutting-edge AI technologies‚Äù to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin‚Äôs stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class.

Title: Ross Gerber sees no upside to Tesla stock. Here are the trades he's making instead.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-stock-ross-gerber-picks-nvidia-meta-bitcoin-buy-gold-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-15T08:15:01Z

Ross Gerber, known as a longtime backer of Tesla, sees no upside in the stock after its latest wipeout. So, where is he seeing opportunity instead? In a recent interview with BI, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management broke down some of his recent market moves amid the ongoing stock correction. Gerber, who is a long-term investor, was hunting for value on Monday when the Nasdaq Composite plunged 4% in its worst day since the 2022 bear market. "I actually bought a little Nvidia yesterday," Gerber said, referencing the Monday sell-off. He also purchased shares of JPMorgan and Meta Platforms during the decline. For Nvidia, it's all about valuation. The AI stock sold off as much as 30% from its January peak amid tariff headwinds and fears of lower-than-expected profit margins. But Gerber highlighted that the stock is trading way too cheap given its elevated growth rate. "You could actually buy Nvidia at 20x earnings and their expected earnings are expected to go up 75% this year and they're buying back stock," Gerber remarked. Bank stocks are also cheap, Gerber said, specifically highlighting JPMorgan as a name he's buying "Banks will have a pretty good year with less regulation, and banks are cheap," Gerber said. JPMorgan is the largest bank in America and currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.2x, a 45% discount to the S&P 500's valuation multiple. Other stocks Gerber had a positive view on included GE Vernova, a renewable energy spin-off from General Electric, TKO Group, which owns UFC and WWE, and Disney. But perhaps the most surprising trade made by Gerber recently was selling the bulk of his bitcoin and using some of the proceeds to buy gold. Gerber said that after years of trading bitcoin, he's learned his lesson about its high volatility and was eager to take profits after the postelection surge. "For my fund, we raised our allocation to 4% and then we made good money on it, so we were up big. But I've learned my lesson over the years trading bitcoin, it's just like I gotta take my money," Gerber said. Regarding gold, Gerber said the uncertainty around the Trump administration should be a tailwind for the risk-off metal. "People buy gold, other countries will buy gold, Europe will buy gold, and just the idea that when you have volatility, there's really only one asset that is meant to really offset that," Gerber said. "It used to be Treasurys and gold, but Treasurys don't actually perform that way as much anymore. I would argue there are substantial risks in Treasurys with this government, so the truth is gold is a really good place if things go crazy," he added. Gold hit a record high of $3,000 an ounce on Friday. The precious metal is up 13% year-to-date.

Title: Trump's breaking point could come soon, analyst tells BI

Good morning. Have you ever had a paintball gun let loose on your vehicle? No? You must not own a Cybertruck then. BI spoke with 10 Cybertruck owners about what it's like driving the most controversial vehicle in the world. In today's big story, we're looking at when the stock market sell-off could force President Donald Trump to drop his trade war. What's on deck Markets: Ross Gerber predicted Tesla's stock crash. Now he's doubling down. Tech: After 10 weeks of Amazon's full RTO, some employees feel energized. Others quit. Business: State and local governments across the US are looking to adopt their own DOGE. But first, when is enough, enough? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. When will the losses become too steep to ignore? It could be soon. Trump's unflinching pursuit of his protectionist agenda has come at a cost: The S&P 500 officially entered a correction on Thursday, down 10% from its February peak. So far, Trump's team has shown that they're willing to tolerate stock market pain ‚Äî but at some point, that pain may become unbearable. Marko Papic, the chief strategist at BCA Research, thinks Trump might not be far away from his breaking point. He said a 15% to 20% decline in the S&P 500 could force the president to start walking back his trade war. Economist Desmond Lachman, meanwhile, says the issue is less about a specific drop and more about how quickly and severely the sell-off unfolds: "What's occurred over the last couple of weeks, if that continues at this kind of pace, he'll have to cave." As BI's William Edwards writes, with top earners propping up consumer spending, a significant stock market decline could start to weigh on their willingness to open their wallets. Investors can blame the trade war. The latest development came on Thursday when Trump threatened a 200% tariff on wine and other alcohol products coming from the EU ‚Äî a retaliatory measure against the EU's new tariffs on $28.4 billion worth of US goods that included a quintessential American drink: whiskey. Businesses, from wine shops to restaurants, are now on the rocks. One couple who run an Italian-Croatian restaurant told BI that they're alarmed: "How does an Italian restaurant pivot away from European wine?" 1. An early Tesla investor-turned-bear doubles down. In late February, Ross Gerber predicted Tesla stock would drop 50% this year. Since then, the stock has tanked. BI followed up, and Gerber doesn't think a rebound is on the horizon. 2. The S&P 500 is officially in a correction, and all signs point to the trade war. The prevailing view is that President Trump's tariffs have rocked investor confidence and triggered recession alarm bells. Following the announcement of a 200% tariff on alcohol from the EU, the S&P 500 finished Thursday 10% down from last month's peak. 3. But JPMorgan thinks the worst is over. The bank thinks a corner of the hedge fund sector ‚Äî not recession fears ‚Äî may be to blame for the market's recent weakness. Now that equity quant funds have reduced their positions, the worst of the correction may be over, it said in a recent note. 1. Checking in on Amazon's RTO rollout. It's been 10 weeks since the tech giant instituted its five-day return-to-office mandate. Eleven employees told us how they're doing ‚Äî including two who quit. 2. Did Apple bite off more than it can chew? The tech giant doesn't tend to overpromise and underdeliver, but some onlookers are noticing a shift. Apple teased some glitzy AI features back in June, but they haven't come to fruition. BI's Peter Kafka broke down Apple's game of catch-up. 3. Meta is trying to silence a former executive. She told BI why. Sarah Wynn-Williams made headlines this week when she released her explosive memoir detailing her time at Meta. BI sat down with the "Careless People" author hours before an arbitrator ruled in Meta's favor, barring Wynn-Williams from promoting it. 1. Little DOGEs everywhere. Republican and libertarian leaders in at least 18 states are copying Elon Musk's slash-and-burn playbook. They've even adopted quirky names, too. (Hello, GOAT and FLOGE.) Meanwhile, the OG DOGE is hiring more staff to pore over death records in search of benefits fraud. 2. Would you rather: PIP or severance? That's the choice some TikTok staffers face after receiving low-performance review scores. Three current employees told BI they thought accepting a performance improvement plan over severance was rare because it's challenging to survive one. 3. You may be footing Big Tech's electricity bill. Companies building data centers are striking secretive electricity deals with utilities, potentially raising the average American's bills, Harvard researchers found. But it's hard to know the exact price tag when the contracts are hidden from the public. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave).

Title: New AI models are running on just one or two chips. Will they trigger another DeepSeek moment for Nvidia?

Time Published: 2025-03-14T13:05:27Z

A new generation of AI models is squeezing more power out of fewer chips. Whether they spark another DeepSeek-scale panic for Nvidia is another matter. Google led the charge this week with a collection of smaller models ‚Äî Gemma 3 ‚Äî that appear to pack a serious punch with a standout feat: they run smoothly with just a single Nvidia chip, known as a GPU. Unveiling the models Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai highlighted their efficiency in an X post, writing that "you'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models." Cohere, a Toronto-headquartered startup led by former Googler Aidan Gomez, also released a new model on Thursday called Command A, which is described as a "state-of-the-art" model that runs on just two GPUs. (Business Insider, alongside other publishers, has sued Cohere over copyright infringement.) One of the key lessons DeepSeek imparted to the world when it released an AI model in January was the ability to do more with less. The Chinese startup said its R1 model was competitive with OpenAI's o1 model while claiming it needed fewer chips. The claim triggered the biggest single-day wipeout in US stock market history, in which Nvidia lost close to $600 billion in value. The market wondered if more efficient AI would reduce demand for Nvidia chips ‚Äî demand that helped it achieve a record full-year revenue in 2024 of $130.5 billion. At first glance, this new wave of AI models seems to pose an even greater threat, as they claim to be state-of-the-art while only needing a handful of GPUs to run. A chart of Gemma's performance on the industry leaderboard Chatbot Arena, for instance ‚Äî shared by Pichai ‚Äî showed the model outperformed those from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta while being run on fewer GPUs. Gemma 3 is here! Our new open models are incredibly efficient - the largest 27B model runs on just one H100 GPU. You'd need at least 10x the compute to get similar performance from other models ‚¨áÔ∏è pic.twitter.com/4FKujOROQ4 But just because more companies are learning to squeeze more performance from their AI with fewer chips, it's not a given that these more efficient models will go on to pose a DeepSeek-style risk to Nvidia. For one, as the DeepSeek saga unfolded, tech CEOs were quick to note a phenomenon known as Jevons Paradox. The economic principle suggests that as technology becomes more efficient, consumption of that technology will increase ‚Äî not decrease. It might help explain why Google itself has said it plans to increase its AI-related capital expenditure this year to $75 billion, which typically includes the GPUs housed in the data centers critical for AI. Google has been one of the main buyers of the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs ‚Äî the Blackwell chips introduced last year ‚Äî so it's plausible to expect them to be among those ready to spend on the new GPU Nvidia is expected to unveil at its GTC event next week. So far, the market does not appear to be worried by the latest chip efficiency developments ‚Äî Nvidia's share price is up about 6% since Tuesday. There is a small caveat to this. While Google's new Gemma models can use a single Nvidia GPU to run on, it appears the training of the new models took place with Google's own chips, known as tensor processing units, or TPUs. Tech giants like Google have spent years working on their own silicon as a means of reducing their dependence on Nvidia, so Gemma poses a curious situation in which Google has produced a competitive AI model without using any Nvidia GPUs for training. Still, it's unlikely that a company like Google will reduce its dependence on Nvidia GPUs in a significant way anytime soon ‚Äî and for a simple reason. The company's push to produce more efficient models is happening alongside its development of more powerful, large-scale Gemini AI models that aim to push the boundaries of intelligence. These models' success, for now, depends on getting access to as much compute as possible. This approach was recently validated by the release of Grok 3, the latest frontier AI model from Elon Musk's startup. Its release came with a note that said a future version of the model would be trained on a larger, 200,000 GPU cluster. The future of AI development, then, looks like one in which two different paths emerge in tandem: one in which smaller, more efficient models emerge that run on fewer GPUs, and another in which large-scale models continue to have as many GPUs thrown at them as possible.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / MARCH 14 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE‚Äôs theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR‚Äôs proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 ‚Äì Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI ‚Äì We attended both Nvidia Corp.‚Äôs GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.‚Äôs investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs‚Äô iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom‚Äôs first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 ‚Äì Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade ‚Äì Sell, hold or double down? ‚Äì Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood‚Äôs ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 ‚Äì Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack ‚Äì It‚Äôs been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we‚Äôve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike‚Äôs earnings print highlights the company‚Äôs impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we‚Äôll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike‚Äôs path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 ‚Äì The unplanned genius of Broadcom‚Äôs route to AI dominance ‚Äì Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn‚Äôt simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom‚Äôs Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 ‚Äì Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off ‚Äì The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed ‚Äì i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 ‚Äì $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft‚Äôs AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We‚Äôll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 ‚Äì Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty ‚Äì As an American, you can‚Äôt help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it‚Äôs a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers‚Ä¶even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel‚Äôs business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel‚Äôs strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 ‚Äì Slicing the Gordian Knot ‚Äì A leap to real time systems of truth ‚Äì In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 ‚Äì Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true ‚Äì ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 ‚Äì 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish ‚Äì According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 ‚Äì Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps ‚Äì We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise‚Äôs operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business ‚Äì e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today‚Äôs data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business‚Äô operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today‚Äôs application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we‚Äôve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 ‚Äì Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions ‚Äì Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 ‚Äì David vs Goliath reimagined ‚Äì OpenAI‚Äôs approach to AI supervision ‚Äì Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI‚Äôs superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI‚Äôs unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We‚Äôll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI‚Äôs characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we‚Äôll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI‚Äôs lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 ‚Äì Moving beyond separation of compute & storage‚Ä¶Journey to the 6th data platform ‚Äì We believe today‚Äôs so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today‚Äôs generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 ‚Äì re:Invent ‚Äô23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS ‚Äì Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon‚Äôs powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ‚Äô23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We‚Äôll review Amazon‚Äôs strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we‚Äôll provide commentary on the chess moves it‚Äôs making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We‚Äôll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 ‚Äì The OpenAI meltdown‚Ä¶Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy ‚Äì Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don‚Äôt quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it‚Äôs more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we‚Äôll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 ‚Äì The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 ‚Äì Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we‚Äôre seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we‚Äôll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 ‚Äì IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity ‚Äì With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 ‚Äì i.e. watsonx. IBM‚Äôs deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM‚Äôs research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We‚Äôll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 ‚Äì The Gen AI power law ‚Äì How data diversity influences adoption ‚Äì Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure‚Äôs AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 ‚Äì AI revenue riddle ‚Äì Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? ‚Äì In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, ‚ÄúYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.‚Äù This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow‚Äôs statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990‚Äôs. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics‚Ä¶yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what‚Äôs happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 ‚Äì From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption ‚Äì MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he‚Äôd be disappointed if AI didn‚Äôt lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR‚Äôs Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 ‚Äì Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform ‚Äì In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we‚Äôve used the metaphor ‚ÄúUber for everyone‚Äù to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 ‚Äì Lower for longer‚Ä¶Tech spending remains tepid ‚Äì We‚Äôre getting used to the phrase, ‚Äúhigher for longer,‚Äù referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed‚Äôs tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it‚Äôs a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We‚Äôll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 ‚Äì Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in ‚Äì In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE‚Äôs Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research‚Äôs Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR‚Äôs recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 ‚Äì Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone‚Ä¶how the future of data apps will evolve ‚Äì The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about ‚ÄúUber for all.‚Äù We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 ‚Äì Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next ‚Äì George Kurtz is pumped up‚Ä¶and why not? CrowdStrike‚Äôs business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company‚Äôs products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We‚Äôll review the company‚Äôs recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we‚Äôll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 ‚Äì Copilot or competitor ‚Äì How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath‚Äôs Northstar ‚Äì UiPath‚Äôs recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We‚Äôll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate‚Äôs impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we‚Äôll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 ‚Äì Google goes all in on the AI cloud ‚Äì At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google‚Äôs messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company‚Äôs focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we‚Äôve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google‚Äôs kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We‚Äôll share ETR data that positions Google‚Äôs AI relative to other leaders and we‚Äôll contrast Google‚Äôs data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 ‚Äì Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft‚Ä¶Why Google may not be Next ‚Äì Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake‚Äôs recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company‚Äôs traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake‚Äôs aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 ‚Äì VMware‚Äôs Future ‚Äì Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom‚Äôs Wing ‚Äì The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom‚Äôs acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom‚Äôs rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We‚Äôll share current ETR survey data to place VMware‚Äôs position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week‚Äôs VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 ‚Äì Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance ‚Äì The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they‚Äôre spending more on AI this year, they‚Äôre doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we‚Äôll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 ‚Äì Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven ‚Äì After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôre pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI‚Äôs rising tide. We‚Äôll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 ‚Äì What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares ‚Äì Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft‚Äôs Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we‚Äôve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS‚Äô big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We‚Äôll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 ‚Äì AI gives cyber attackers the advantage‚Ä¶for now ‚Äì Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 ‚Äì AI meets cloud security ‚Äì and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 ‚Äì AI won‚Äôt be a winner takes all market ‚Äì The AI heard ‚Äôround the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that‚Äôs going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 ‚Äì Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack ‚Äì The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it‚Äôs unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data ‚Äì e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance‚Ä¶and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 ‚Äì Connecting the Dots on Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud Ambitions ‚Äì Over the past several months we‚Äôve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week‚Äôs Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of ‚ÄúAll Data / All Workloads‚Äù and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake‚Äôs core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn‚Äôt mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake‚Äôs high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we‚Äôll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 ‚Äì HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits ‚Äì HPE‚Äôs announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE‚Äôs LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company‚Äôs recent Discover conference and we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today‚Äôs public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 ‚Äì Uber‚Äôs architecture represents the future of data apps‚Ä¶meet its architects ‚Äì Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company‚Äôs mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company‚Äôs productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you‚Äôd find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber‚Äôs technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber‚Äôs groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We‚Äôll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps‚Ä¶here‚Äôs our take ‚Äì Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we‚Äôll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 ‚Äì Cisco needs to simplify‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs how ‚Äì With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco‚Äôs challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company‚Äôs mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco‚Äôs business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 ‚Äì The future of AI is real time data‚Ä¶Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines ‚Äì The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company‚Äôs value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia‚Äôs momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we‚Äôll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 ‚Äì The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud ‚Äì AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week‚Äôs post. Look past the buzz and you‚Äôll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it‚Äôs a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we‚Äôll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud‚Ä¶what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware‚Äôs future evolves. We‚Äôll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We‚Äôll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 ‚Äì Searching for gold in enterprise AI ‚Äì The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week‚Äôs Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 ‚Äì Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation ‚Äì While we‚Äôve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don‚Äôt see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We‚Äôll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we‚Äôll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 ‚Äì Don‚Äôt be fooled by slowing cloud growth‚Ä¶cost optimization is a feature not a bug ‚Äì The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don‚Äôt kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We‚Äôll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 ‚Äì RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 ‚Äì The narrative from security vendors is organizations don‚Äôt spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe‚Ä¶but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can‚Äôt hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires‚Ä¶but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week‚Äôs episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we‚Äôre excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we‚Äôll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We‚Äôll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto‚Äôs threat intelligence and response division. As well, we‚Äôll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 ‚Äì RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI ‚Äì In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We‚Äôll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we‚Äôll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 ‚Äì Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day ‚Äì On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE‚Äôs culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share our takeaways from HPE‚Äôs event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri‚Äôs quarterly all-hands meeting. We‚Äôll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We‚Äôll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE‚Äôs market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 ‚Äì Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft ‚Äì A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week‚Äôs guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we‚Äôll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 ‚Äì Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 ‚Äì GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms ‚Äì The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 ‚Äì Databricks faces critical strategic decisions‚Ä¶here‚Äôs why ‚Äì When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We‚Äôll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 ‚Äì MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech ‚Äì While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We‚Äôll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We‚Äôll close with the key innovation areas we‚Äôll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 ‚Äì MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business ‚Äì The world‚Äôs leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It‚Äôs become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We‚Äôll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they‚Äôre faring in the telecomms vertical. And we‚Äôll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 ‚Äì Google‚Äôs Point of View on Confidential Computing ‚Äì Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it‚Äôs just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we‚Äôll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let‚Äôs summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 ‚Äì Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 ‚Äì The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won‚Äôt abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what‚Äôs happening in cloud markets ‚Äì not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we‚Äôll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 ‚Äì Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security ‚Äì lots to talk about there ‚Äì generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 ‚Äì ChatGPT Won‚Äôt Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage ‚Äì OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don‚Äôt believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company‚Äôs early entry into the space may not confer ‚Äúgame over‚Äù advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 ‚Äì Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps ‚Äì Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we‚Äôll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 ‚Äì CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization ‚Äì Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it‚Äôs to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data ‚Äúright‚Äù is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 ‚Äì AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive ‚Äì A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We‚Äôll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 ‚Äì Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions ‚Äì Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year‚Äôs enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 ‚Äì How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity ‚Äì Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week‚Äôs cybersecurity update. We‚Äôll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 ‚Äì Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean ‚Äì While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we‚Äôve previously reported, the CISO‚Äôs budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We‚Äôll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren‚Äôt as much. We‚Äôll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 ‚Äì re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud ‚Äì The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives ‚Äì i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud ‚Äì compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier‚Äôs annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We‚Äôll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we‚Äôll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 ‚Äì Snowflake caught in the storm clouds ‚Äì A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we‚Äôve stressed many times, the company‚Äôs management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn‚Äôt matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 ‚Äì Cloudflare‚Äôs Supercloud‚Ä¶What Multi Cloud Could Have Been ‚Äì Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine‚Äì allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company‚Äôs future. In this post, we‚Äôll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We‚Äôll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we‚Äôll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 ‚Äì Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy ‚Äì Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you‚Äôre cruising along thinking‚Ä¶ok that was weird but it‚Äôs clear sailing now‚Ä¶only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations ‚Äì including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review the implications of this week‚Äôs earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform‚Äôs growth accelerated. We‚Äôll explain why GCP‚Äôs growth is still not fast enough. We‚Äôll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 ‚Äì Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data ‚Äì The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It‚Äôs understandable why there‚Äôs so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we‚Äôre going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 ‚Äì CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next ‚Äì This past week, we saw two of the ‚ÄúBig 3‚Äù cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today‚Äôs cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We‚Äôll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors ‚Äì Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 ‚Äì Analyst Take on Dell ‚Äì Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 ‚Äì Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend ‚Äì Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that‚Äôs clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations‚Ä¶but these levels are still well above historical norms ‚Äì so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good ‚Äì at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs‚Ä¶and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 ‚Äì As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch ‚Äì Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not‚Ä¶ the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there‚Äôs no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it‚Äôs becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can‚Äôt hide behind the macro. Which is why it‚Äôs important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum ‚Äì and relative high spending velocity on their platforms ‚Äì albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 ‚Äì UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course ‚Äì Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath‚Äôs customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company‚Äôs prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 ‚Äì How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform ‚Äì In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike‚Äôs user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 ‚Äì We Have the Data‚Ä¶What Private Tech Companies Don‚Äôt Tell you About Their Business ‚Äì The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there‚Äôs lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn‚Äôt as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you‚Äôre an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we‚Äôve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It‚Äôs called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they‚Äôre able to capture. We‚Äôve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we‚Äôre going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 ‚Äì VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey ‚Äì While the precise direction of VMware‚Äôs future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We‚Äôll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we‚Äôll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 ‚Äì What Black Hat ‚Äô22 tells us about securing the Supercloud ‚Äì Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE‚Äôs supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It‚Äôs a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they‚Äôve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We‚Äôll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We‚Äôll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 ‚Äì Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others ‚Äì At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 ‚Äì What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 ‚Äì The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network‚Ä¶essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner ‚Äì what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud‚Ä¶sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth ‚Äì i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience ‚Äì is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 ‚Äì How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s ‚Äì AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the ‚Äúfree safety‚Äù in the equation ‚Äì i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We‚Äôll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS‚Äô secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 ‚Äì AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity ‚Äì After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we‚Äôll share our view of what‚Äôs changed since our last cyber update in May, we‚Äôll look at the macro environment, how it‚Äôs impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week‚Äôs AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 ‚Äì Amping it up with Frank Slootman ‚Äì Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don‚Äôt need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It‚Äôs called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I‚Äôve read it several times and if you haven‚Äôt picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank‚Äôs philosophy. You‚Äôll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 ‚Äì Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud ‚Äì As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 ‚Äì H1 of ‚Äò22 was ugly‚Ä¶H2 could be worse‚Ä¶Here‚Äôs why we‚Äôre still optimistic ‚Äì After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 ‚Äì Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 ‚Äì Snowflake Summit 2022‚Ä¶All About Apps & Monetization ‚Äì Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop‚Äôs relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake‚Äôs Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 ‚Äì How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard ‚Äì When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW‚Äôs stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli‚Äôs leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they‚Äôd repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn‚Äôt really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman‚Äôs track record of execution‚Ä¶and data. Good bets; but folks really didn‚Äôt appreciate that Snowflake wasn‚Äôt just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud‚Ä¶and we‚Äôve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we‚Äôll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company‚Äôs CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building ‚Äì i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar‚Äôs Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 ‚Äì MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones ‚Äì Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company‚Äôs business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 ‚Äì Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast ‚Äì In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty‚Ä¶nope‚Ä¶they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that‚Äôs inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom‚Äôs planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 ‚Äì Supercloud is becoming a thing ‚Äì Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We‚Äôve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we‚Äôve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we‚Äôve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we‚Äôve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept‚Äôs technical and business feasibility. We‚Äôll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they‚Äôre at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 ‚Äì Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? ‚Äì Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late‚Ä¶Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta‚Äôs performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company‚Äôs stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November‚Ä¶Meanwhile CyberArk‚Äôs recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal ‚Äì In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a ‚Äúgolf clap‚Äù in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World‚Ä¶ and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We‚Äôll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth‚Äôs orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe ‚Äì Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation‚Ä¶the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba‚Äôs cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we‚Äôve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We‚Äôre seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers‚Äô workloads live ‚Äì in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week‚Äôs Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what‚Äôs happening in the ‚Äúhybrid zone‚Äù of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter ‚Äì The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely ‚Äî software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we‚Äôve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we‚Äôve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 ‚Äì Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh ‚Äì The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today‚Äôs Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 ‚Äì Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think ‚Äì The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta‚Äôs response have been harsh and the impact on Okta‚Äôs value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company‚Äôs market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta‚Äôs claim that the customer technical impact was ‚Äúnear zero,‚Äù may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta‚Äôs public statements. Okta‚Äôs product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we‚Äôll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 ‚Äì New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending ‚Äì Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we‚Äôre seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We‚Äôll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 ‚Äì Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy ‚Äì There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we‚Äôre talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government‚Äôs track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today‚Äôs policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week‚Äôs Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments‚Äô antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 ‚Äì Snowflake‚Äôs Wild Ride ‚Äì Snowflake‚Ä¶they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That‚Äôs the nature of the business isn‚Äôt it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there‚Äôs no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake‚Äôs stock since its IPO, why it‚Äôs behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 ‚Äì Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle ‚Äì Intel‚Äôs future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company‚Äôs future is in serious jeopardy. It‚Äôs the same story we‚Äôve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel‚Äôs efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today‚Äôs leading foundries and design shops. Intel‚Äôs best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck ‚Äì perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest assessment of Intel‚Äôs competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company‚Äôs February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 ‚Äì RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here‚Äôs What‚Äôs New ‚Äì In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 ‚Äì Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising ‚Äì The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We‚Äôll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 ‚Äì The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes ‚Äì The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS‚Äô dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled ‚ÄúKubernetes.‚Äù In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We‚Äôll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we‚Äôll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 ‚Äì What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond ‚Äì We‚Äôve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won‚Äôt be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don‚Äôt see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 ‚Äì Securing Snowflake ‚Äì The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would ‚Äúchase the chips‚Äù in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds ‚Äì and at the edge ‚Äì practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 ‚Äì Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 ‚Äì The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it‚Äôs had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we‚Äôve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what‚Äôs ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We‚Äôll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 ‚Äì Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse ‚Äì When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It‚Äôs easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it‚Äôs very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 ‚Äì Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management ‚Äì In the 2010‚Äôs, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We‚Äôve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we‚Äôve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 ‚Äì Grading our 2021 Predictions ‚Äì Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we‚Äôll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 ‚Äì Why Oracle‚Äôs Stock is Surging to an All time High ‚Äì On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle‚Äôs success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world‚Äôs most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they‚Äôre convinced Oracle‚Äôs cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review Oracle‚Äôs most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company‚Äôs cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 ‚Äì Rise of the Supercloud ‚Äì Last week‚Äôs AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world‚Äôs most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it‚Äôs clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS‚Äô cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds‚Äì that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we‚Äôll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 ‚Äì Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary ‚Äì Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there‚Äôs a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon‚Äôs ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We‚Äôll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 ‚Äì AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum ‚Äì Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers‚Ä¶the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It‚Äôs unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don‚Äôt run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We‚Äôll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 ‚Äì Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability ‚Äì Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye ‚Äì or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called ‚Äúmodern tech stack.‚Äù Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 ‚Äì What Could Disrupt Amazon? ‚Äì Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T ‚Äì off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm ‚Äì The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley ‚Äì broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon ‚Äì has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today‚Äôs trillionaire companies. And we‚Äôll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 ‚Äì Data Mesh‚Ä¶A New Paradigm for Data Management ‚Äì Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it‚Äôs an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it‚Äôs a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 ‚Äì The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real ‚Äì It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We‚Äôve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there‚Äôs little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there‚Äôs a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It‚Äôs unlikely they can buy all that ‚Äì so they‚Äôre going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest ‚Äì between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 ‚Äì The Future of the Semiconductor Industry ‚Äì Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence‚Ä¶these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we‚Äôve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 ‚Äì UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV ‚Äì UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra‚Ä¶creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known‚Ä¶the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week‚Ä¶with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It‚Äôs also ‚ÄúFast Forwarding‚Äù as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 ‚Äì CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 ‚Äì Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR‚Äôs macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 ‚Äì How Cisco can win cloud‚Äôs ‚ÄòGame of Thrones‚Äô ‚Äì Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It‚Äôs doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco‚Äôs dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco‚Äôs portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 ‚Äì The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler ‚Äì Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital ‚Äì i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors‚Äô minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it‚Äôs our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 ‚Äì Thinking Outside the Box‚Ä¶AWS Signals a New Era for Storage ‚Äì By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS‚Äô Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day ‚Äì a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service ‚Äì and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 ‚Äì Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market ‚Äì Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren‚Äôt in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 ‚Äì Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try‚Ä¶ ‚Äì Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta‚Äôs market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 ‚Äì Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s ‚Äì Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 ‚Äì Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 ‚Äì Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year‚Äôs contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we‚Äôll share some takeaways from ETR‚Äôs latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We‚Äôll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon‚Äôs latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 ‚Äì ServiceNow‚Äôs Collision Course with Salesforce.com ‚Äì ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

Title: Power Cut

Time Published: 2025-03-14T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A week ago, analyst TD Cowen revealed that Microsoft had canceled leases "totalling a couple hundred MWs," with "at least two private data center operators across multiple US markets." The report also details how Microsoft "pulled back on converting negotiated and signed Statement[s] of Qualifications (SQQs)," which it added was "the precursor to a data center lease." Although the analyst added it was unclear whether Microsoft might convert them in the future, these SQQs converted into leases "close to 100%" of the time. Cancelling them was, therefore, rather unusual. TD Cowen also added that Microsoft was "re-allocating a considerable portion of [its] projected international spend to the US, which suggests to [TD Cowen] a material slowdown in international leasing." But one crucial, teeny tiny part of the report was missed by just about everybody, emphasis mine: What TD Cowen is saying is not just that "Microsoft canceled some data centers," but that Microsoft also effectively canceled over a gigawatt of data center operations on top of the previously-reported "multiple +100W megawatt deals." If we add in the land under contract, and the deals that were in-flight, the total capacity likely amounts to even more than that. For some context, Data Center Dynamics reported that Microsoft had 5GW of data center capacity in April 2024, saying that Microsoft had planned to add 1 gigawatt of capacity by October 2024, and another 1.5 gigawatts of capacity by the first half of 2025. Based on this reporting, one can estimate that Microsoft has somewhere between 6 and 7 gigawatts of capacity at this time. As a result, based on TD Cowen's analysis, Microsoft has, through a combination of canceled leases, pullbacks on Statements of Qualifications, cancellations of land parcels and deliberate expiration of Letters of Intent, effectively abandoned data center expansion equivalent to over 14% of its current capacity. These numbers heavily suggest that Microsoft ‚Äî the biggest purchaser of NVIDIA's GPUs and, according to TD Cowen, "the most active [data center] lessee of capacity in 2023 and 1H24" ‚Äî does not believe there is future growth in generative AI, nor does it have faith in (nor does it want responsibility for) the future of OpenAI. Data center buildouts take about three to six years to complete, and the largest hyperscale facilities can easily cost several billion dollars, meaning that these moves are extremely forward-looking. You don‚Äôt build a data center for the demand you have now, but for the demand you expect further down the line. This suggests that Microsoft believes its current infrastructure (and its likely scaled-back plans for expansion) will be sufficient for a movement that CEO Satya Nadella called a "golden age for systems" less than a year ago. To quote TD Cowen again: To explain here, TD Cowen is effectively saying that Microsoft is responding to a "major demand signal" and said "major demand signal" is saying "you do not need more data centers." Said demand signal that Microsoft was responding to, in TD Cowen's words, is its "appetite for capacity" to provide servers to OpenAI, and it seems that said appetite is waning, and Microsoft no longer wants to build out data centers for OpenAI. The reason I'm writing in such blunt-force terms is that I want to make it clear that Microsoft is effectively cutting its data center expansion by over a gigawatt of capacity, if not more, and it‚Äôs impossible to reconcile these cuts with the expectation that generative AI will be a massive, transformative technological phenomenon. I believe the reason Microsoft is cutting back is that it does not have the appetite to provide further data center expansion for OpenAI, and it‚Äôs having doubts about the future of generative AI as a whole. If Microsoft believed there was a massive opportunity in supporting OpenAI's further growth, or that it had "massive demand" for generative AI services, there would be no reason to cancel capacity, let alone cancel such a significant amount. These moves also suggest that Microsoft is walking away from building and training further large frontier models, and from supporting doing so for others. Remember, Microsoft has significantly more insight into the current health and growth of generative AI than any other company. As OpenAI's largest backer and infrastructural partner (and the owners of the server architecture where OpenAI trains its ultra-expensive models, not to mention the largest shareholder in OpenAI), Microsoft can see exactly what is (or isn't) coming down the pike, on top of having a view both into the sales of its own generative AI-powered software (such as Microsoft 365 Copilot) and sales of both model services and cloud compute for other models on Microsoft Azure. In plain English, Microsoft, which arguably has more data than anybody else about the health of the generative AI industry and its potential for growth, has decided that it needs to dramatically slow down its expansion. Expansion which, to hammer the point home, is absolutely necessary for generative AI to continue evolving and expanding. Cushman and Wakefield's 2024 Global Data Center Market Comparison gives some chilling context into how significant Microsoft's pullback is. A gigawatt of data center capacity is roughly the entire operational IT load of Tokyo (1.028GW), orLondon (996MW), or the Bay Area (842MW). And, again, the total figure is likely far higher than a gigawatt. That number only accounts for the LOIs that Microsoft allowed to expire. It doesn‚Äôt include everything else, like the two data centers it already killed, or the land parcels it abandoned, or the deals that were in the early-to-mid stages of negotiation. Microsoft is not simply "walking back some future plans." It is effectively canceling (what it has loudly insisted is) the future. If you think that sounds hyperbolic, consider this: London and Tokyo are respectively the biggest data center markets in Europe and Asia, according to the same Cushman and Wakefield report. In the event that Microsoft believed there was meaningful growth in generative AI, it wouldn't be canceling anything, or at the very least wouldn't be canceling so much. Canceling cities-worth of capacity at a time when artificial intelligence is supposedly revolutionizing everything suggests that artificial intelligence isn't really revolutionizing anything. One other detail in TD Cowen's report really stood out. While there is a pullback in Microsoft's data center leasing, it‚Äôs seen a "commensurate rise in demand from Oracle related to The Stargate Project" ‚Äî a relatively new partnership of "up to $500 billion" to build massive new data centers for AI, led by SoftBank, and OpenAI, with investment from Oracle and MGX, a $100 billion investment fund backed by the United Arab Emirates. OpenAI has committed $19 billion to the Stargate project ‚Äî money it doesn't have, meaning that part of $25 billion to $40 billion funding round that OpenAI is currently raising will be committed to funding these data centers (unless, as I'll get to later, OpenAI raises more debt). Leading the round is SoftBank, which is also committing $19 billion, as well as creating a joint venture called SB OpenAI Japan to offer OpenAI's services to the Japanese market, as well as "spending $3 billion annually to use OpenAI's technology across its group businesses" according to the Wall Street Journal. In simpler terms, SoftBank is investing as much as $25 billion in OpenAI, then spending another $3 billion a year on software that only loses money, and still hallucinates, and shows no sign of getting meaningfully better or more reliable. Whether Softbank actually sees value in OpenAI‚Äôs tech, or whether this purchase deal is a subsidy by the backdoor, is open to debate. Given that $3bn is equivalent to OpenAI‚Äôs entire revenue from selling premium access to ChatGPT in 2024 ‚Äî which included some major deals with the likes of PriceWaterhouseCoopers ‚Äî I‚Äôm inclined to believe the latter. Even then, how feasible is it that SoftBank can continue paying? To get the deal done, Microsoft changed the terms of its exclusive relationship with OpenAI to allow it to work with Oracle to build out further data centers full of the GPUs necessary to power its unprofitable, unsustainable models. The Oracle/Stargate situation was a direct result ‚Äî according to reporting from The Information ‚Äî of OpenAI becoming frustrated with Microsoft for not providing it with servers fast enough, including an allotment of 300,000 of NVIDIA's GB200 chips by the end of 2025. For what it‚Äôs worth, The Wall Street Journal reports that Microsoft was getting increasingly frustrated with OpenAI‚Äôs constant demands for more compute. The relationship between the two entities had started to fray, with both sides feeling somewhat aggrieved. This, combined with Microsoft's data center pullback, heavily suggests that Microsoft is no longer interested in being OpenAI's infrastructure partner long-term ‚Äî after all, if it was, it'd fund and support OpenAI‚Äôs expansion rather than doing the literal opposite. Here's a question: if generative AI had so much demand, why is Microsoft canceling data center contracts? Why is Microsoft ‚Äî Oracle's largest customer as of the end of 2023 ‚Äî allowing SoftBank and OpenAI to work with Oracle to build the future rather than itself? As mentioned previously, TD Cowen specifically noted in its report that Microsoft's "shift in appetite for capacity [was] tied to OpenAI," which heavily suggests that Microsoft is, at best, less invested in the future of OpenAI, a statement confirmed by The Information, which adds that Microsoft had been trying to "lessen its reliance on OpenAI technology as they increasingly compete in selling AI products." At worst, this situation could suggest that Microsoft is actively dumping OpenAI, and is having questions about the fundamentals of the generative AI industry. In very plain terms, Microsoft, despite its excitement around artificial intelligence and its dogged insistence that it‚Äôs the future of technology, has canceled data center leases and over a gigawatt of other datacenter infrastructure. Doing so heavily suggests that Microsoft does not intend to expand its data center operations, or at least, to the extraordinary levels the company initially promised. While Microsoft has reiterated that it intends to spend $80 billion in capital expenditures on AI in 2025, it's unclear how it intends to do so if it‚Äôs pulling back on data center expansion at such a large scale, and the company has provided no tangible explanation or elaboration as to how it might do so. While hardware upgrades could account for some of its capital expenditures, it would be nowhere near the $80bn figure. Again, hyperscale datacenters aren‚Äôt cheap. They‚Äôre massive, billion-dollar (or multi-billion) ventures. Microsoft also added in a comment to CNBC in the same article that it "[continues] to grow at a record pace to meet customer demand." Quick question: what customer demand? Microsoft said back in April 2024 that "AI demand was exceeding supply even after a 79% surge in capital expenditures," and CFO Amy Hood said in its next quarterly earnings in July 2024 that "demand remained higher than [Microsoft's] available capacity." On its most recent (January 2025) earnings call, CFO Amy Hood once said "Azure growth included 13 points from AI services, which grew 157% year over year and was ahead of expectations even as demand continued to be higher than our available capacity." Riddle me this, Batman ‚Äî why does a company that keeps talking about having demand that exceeds capacity decide to cancel multiple data centers which, collectively, account for a significant chunk of its existing capacity? Let's see what Microsoft had to say when asked a week or two ago! Sounds like Microsoft built too much capacity, and in fact has yet to see the consumer demand to actually reach it! In fact, a couple of weeks ago Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a podcast interview that "one of the things is that there will be [as a result of data center expansion related to AI] overbuild." Microsoft also in late January said it had ‚Äú$13 billion in annual recurring revenue‚Äù from AI ‚Äî not profit, and ‚ÄúAI‚Äù is not a line item on its earnings, meaning this is all related revenue put into a ball with no context. Either way, this is a piddly amount that works out to about $3.25 billion a quarter. These are mediocre numbers and Microsoft‚Äôs data center pullback suggests that they‚Äôre not going to improve. According to The Information, OpenAI plans to have Stargate handle three quarters of its computing needs by 2030, which heavily suggests that Microsoft canceling so much capacity is, on some level, linked to OpenAI‚Äôs future plans. While The Information reports that OpenAI is still forecasting to spend $13 billion in 2025 and as much as $28 billion in 2028 on Microsoft‚Äôs cloud compute, in addition to whatever capacity it gets from Stargate or Oracle, one has to wonder how it intends to do so if it needs the capacity Microsoft simply isn‚Äôt building. These are two huge numbers. For context, $13 billion is about ten percent of Microsoft‚Äôs cloud revenue in the 2024 fiscal year, though it's unclear whether Microsoft counts OpenAI's compute as revenue. Nevertheless, I have real concerns about whether OpenAI is even capable of expanding further, starting with a fairly obvious one: its only source of money, SoftBank. Let‚Äôs start with a few facts: Doing some napkin maths, here‚Äôs what SoftBank has agreed to: SoftBank made about $12.14 billion (1.83 Trillion Yen) in revenue in Q4 2024, losing $2.449 billion (369.17 billion Yen), but made a profit of about $7.82 billion (1.18 trillion Yen) in Q3 2024. Nevertheless, SoftBank has agreed to effectively bankroll OpenAI‚Äôs future ‚Äî agreeing to over $46 billion of investments over the next few years ‚Äî and does not appear to be able to do so without selling its current holdings in valuable companies like ARM or taking on at least $16 billion of debt this year, representing a 55% increase over its current liabilities. Worse still, thanks to this agreement, OpenAI‚Äôs future ‚Äî both in its ability to expand its infrastructure (which appears to be entirely contingent on the construction of Stargate) and its ability to raise funding ‚Äî is entirely dependent on SoftBank, which in turn must borrow money to fund it. On top of that, OpenAI anticipates it will burn as much as $40 billion a year by 2028, and projects to only turn a profit ‚Äúby the end of the decade after the buildout of Stargate,‚Äù which, I add, is almost entirely dependent on SoftBank, which has to take on debt to fund both OpenAI and the project required to (allegedly, theoretically) make OpenAI profitable. How the fuck does this work? OpenAI, a company that spent $9 billion to lose $5 billion in 2024, requires so much money to meet its obligations (both to cover its ruinous, unprofitable, unsustainable operations and the $18bn to $19bn it committed to keep growing) that it has to raise more money than any startup has ever raised in history ‚Äî $40 billion ‚Äî with the cast-iron guarantee that it will need more money within a year. To raise said money, the only benefactor willing to provide it (SoftBank) has to borrow money, and is not able to give OpenAI said money up front in part because it does not have it. SoftBank ‚Äî on top of the $30 billion of funding and $3 billion a year in revenue it‚Äôs committed to OpenAI itself ‚Äî also has to cough up $18 billion for Stargate, a data center project that OpenAI will run and SoftBank will take financial responsibility for. That‚Äôs $48 billion in cash, and $3 billion in revenue, the latter of which, like all of OpenAI‚Äôs offerings, loses the company money. OpenAI has no path to profitability, guaranteeing it will need more cash, and right now ‚Äî at the time when it needs the most it‚Äôs ever needed ‚Äî SoftBank, the only company willing to provide it, has proven that it will have to go to great lengths to do so. If OpenAI needs $40 billion in 2025, how much will it need in 2026? $50 billion? $100 billion? Where is that money going to come from? While SoftBank might be able to do this once, what happens when OpenAI needs more money in 6-to-12 months? SoftBank made about $15 billion of profit in the last year on about $46 billion of revenue. $3 billion is an obscene amount to commit to buying OpenAI‚Äôs software annually, especially when some of it is allegedly for access to OpenAI‚Äôs barely-functional ‚ÄúOperator‚Äù and mediocre ‚ÄúDeep Research‚Äù products. As per my previous pieces, I do not see how OpenAI survives, and SoftBank‚Äôs involvement only gives me further concern. While SoftBank could theoretically burn its current holdings to fund OpenAI in perpetuity, its ability to do so is cast into doubt by them having to borrow money from other banks to get both this funding round and Stargate done. OpenAI burned $5 billion in 2024, a number it‚Äôll likely double in 2025 (remember, the Information reported that OpenAI was projected to spend $13 billion on compute alone with Microsoft in 2025), and it has no path to profitability. SoftBank has already had to borrow to fund this round, and the fact it had to do so suggests its inability to continue supporting OpenAI without accruing further debt. OpenAI (as a result of Microsoft‚Äôs cuts to data center capacity) now only has one real path to expansion once it runs through whatever remaining buildout Microsoft has planned, and that‚Äôs Stargate, a project funded by OpenAI‚Äôs contribution (which it‚Äôs receiving from SoftBank) and SoftBank, which is having to take loans to meet its share. How does this work, exactly? How does this continue? Do you see anyone else stepping up to fund this? Who else has got $30 billion to throw at this nonsense? While the answer is ‚ÄúSaudi Arabia,‚Äù SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son recently said that he had ‚Äúnot given [Saudi ruler Mohammed Bin Salman] enough return,‚Äù adding that he ‚Äústill owed him.‚Äù Nothing about this suggests that Saudi money will follow SoftBank‚Äôs in anywhere near the volume necessary. As for the Emiratis, they‚Äôre already involved through the MGX fund, and it‚Äôs unclear how much more they‚Äôd be willing to commit. No, really, how does this work? In my opinion, the OpenAI-SoftBank deal is wildly unsustainable, dependent on SoftBank continuing to both raise debt and funnel money directly into a company that burns billions of dollars a year, and is set to only burn more thanks to the arrival of its latest model. And if it had a huge breakthrough that would change everything, wouldn‚Äôt Microsoft want to make sure they‚Äôd built the data center capacity to support it? About GPT-4.5‚Ä¶ Last week, OpenAI launched GPT 4.5, its latest model that‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶Sam Altman says ‚Äúis the first model that feels like talking to a thoughtful person.‚Äù It is not obvious what it does better, or even really what it does, other than Altman says it is ‚Äúa different kind of intelligence and there‚Äôs a magic to it [he hasn‚Äôt] felt before.‚Äù This was, in Altman‚Äôs words, ‚Äúthe good news.‚Äù The bad news was that, and I quote, GPT 4.5 is ‚Äú...a giant, expensive model,‚Äù adding that OpenAI was ‚Äúout of GPUs,‚Äù but proudly declaring that it‚Äôd add ‚Äútens of thousands of GPUs the next week‚Äù to roll it out to OpenAI‚Äôs $20-a-month ‚Äúplus tier‚Äù and that he would be adding ‚Äúhundreds of thousands [of GPUs]‚Äù ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù Excited? Well you shouldn‚Äôt be. On top of a vague product-set and indeterminately-high compute costs, GPT 4.5 costs an incredible $75 per million input tokens (prompts and data pushed into a model) and $150 per million output tokens (as in the output it creates), or roughly 3,000% more for input tokens and 1,500% more expensive for output tokens than GPT-4o for results OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy described as ‚Äúa little bit better and‚Ä¶awesome‚Ä¶but also not exactly in ways that are trivial to point to,‚Äù and one developer described 4.5 to ArsTechnica as ‚Äúa lemon‚Äù when comparing its reported performance to its price. ArsTechnica also described GPT-4.5 as ‚Äúterrible for coding, relatively speaking,‚Äù and other tests showed that the model‚Äôs performance was either slightly better or slightly worse across the board, with, according to ArsTechnica one ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù metric being that OpenAI found human evaluators "preferred GPT 4.5‚Äôs responses over GPT-4o in about 57% of interactions. So, to be crystal clear, the biggest AI company‚Äôs latest model appears to be even more ruinously expensive than its last one while providing modest-at-best improvements and performing worse on several benchmarks than competing models. Despite these piss-poor results, Sam Altman‚Äôs reaction is to bring hundreds of thousands of GPUs online as a means of exposing as many people as possible to his mediocre, ultra-expensive model, and the best that Altman has to offer is that this is ‚Äú...the first time people have been emailing with such passion asking [OpenAI] to promise to never stop offering a specific model.‚Äù This, by the way, is the company that‚Äôs about to raise $40 billion led by a Japanese bank that has to go into debt to fund both OpenAI‚Äôs operations and the infrastructure necessary for it to grow any further. Again, Microsoft is cancelling plans to massively expand its data center capacity right at a time when OpenAI just released its most computationally-demanding model ever. How do you reconcile those two things without concluding either that Microsoft expects GPT-4.5 to be a flop, or that it‚Äôs simply unwilling to continue bankrolling OpenAI‚Äôs continued growth, or that it‚Äôs having doubts about the future of generative AI as a whole? I have been ‚Äî and remain ‚Äî hesitant to ‚Äúcall the bubble bursting,‚Äù because bubbles do not burst in neat little events. Nevertheless, my pale horses I‚Äôve predicted in the past were led by one specific call ‚Äî that a reduction in capital expenditures by a hyperscaler was a sign that things were collapsing. Microsoft walking away from over a Gigawatt of data center plans ‚Äî equivalent to as much as 14% of its current data center capacity ‚Äî is a direct sign that it does not believe the growth is there in generative AI, and thus are not building the infrastructure to support it, and indeed may have overbuilt ‚Äî something that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has directly foreshadowed. The entirety of the tech industry ‚Äî and the AI bubble ‚Äî has been built on the assumption that generative AI was the next big growth vehicle for the tech industry, and if Microsoft, the largest purchaser of NVIDIA GPUs and the most aggressive builder of AI infrastructure, is reducing capacity, it heavily suggests that the growth is not there. Microsoft has, by the looks of things, effectively given up on further data center expansion. At least, at the breakneck pace it once promised. AI boosters will reply by saying there‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt know ‚Äî that in fact Microsoft has some greater strategy, but answer me this: why is Microsoft canceling over a gigawatt of data center expansion? And, again, this is the most conservative estimate. The realistic number is much, much higher. Do you think it‚Äôs because it expects there to be this dramatic demand for their artificial intelligence services? Do you think it‚Äôs reducing supply because of all of the demand? One might argue that Microsoft‚Äôs reduction in capacity buildout is just a sign that OpenAI is moving its compute elsewhere, and while that might be true, here‚Äôre some questions to ask: Microsoft making such a material pullback on data center expansion suggests that the growth in generative AI products, both those run on Microsoft‚Äôs servers and those sold as part of Microsoft‚Äôs products, do not have the revolutionary growth-trajectory that both CFO Amy Hood and CEO Satya Nadella have been claiming, and this is deeply concerning, while also calling into concern the viability of generative AI as a growth vehicle for any hyperscaler. If I am correct, Microsoft is walking away from not just the expansion of its current data center operations, but from generative AI writ large. I actually believe it will continue selling this unprofitable, unsustainable software, because the capacity it has right now is more than sufficient to deal with the lack of demand. It is time for investors and the general public to begin demanding tangible and direct numbers on the revenue and profits related to generative AI, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that the revenues are small and the profits are non-existent. A gigawatt of capacity is huge, and walking away from that much capacity is a direct signal that Microsoft‚Äôs long term plans do not include needing a great deal of compute. One counter could be that it‚Äôs waiting for more of the specialized NVIDIA GPUs to arrive, to which the response is ‚ÄúMicrosoft still wants to build the capacity so that it has somewhere to put them.‚Äù Again, these facilities take anywhere between three and six years to build. Do you really think Blackwell will be delayed that long? NVIDIA committed to a once-a-year cycle for their AI chips after all. One counter could be that there isn‚Äôt the power necessary to power these data centers, and if that‚Äôs the case ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt, but let me humour the idea ‚Äî then the suggestion is that Microsoft is currently changing its entire data center strategy so significantly that it now has to issue over a gigawatt‚Äôs worth of statements of intent across the country to different places with‚Ä¶more power? Another counter is that I‚Äôm only talking about leases, and not purchases. In that case, I‚Äôll refer you to this article from CBRE, which provides an elucidating read on how hyperscalers actually invest in data center infrastructure. Leases tend to account for the majority of spending, simply because it‚Äôs less risky. A specialist takes care of the tough stuff ‚Äî like finding a location, buying the land, handling construction ‚Äî and the hyperscaler isn‚Äôt left trying to figure out what to do with the facility when it reaches the end of its useful lifecycle. I also recognize that this is kind of a big, juicy steak for someone people call an ‚ÄúAI cynic.‚Äù I have poured over this data repeatedly, and done all I can to find less-convenient conclusions. Letters of Intent are likely the weakest part of the argument ‚Äî these are serious documents, but not always legally-binding. Neither are SoQs, but as TD Cowen points out, these are treated as the green light to start work on construction, even though a formal lease agreement hasn‚Äôt yet been signed. And to be clear, Microsoft let an indeterminate amount of those go too. Nevertheless, it is incredibly significant that Microsoft is letting so many ‚Äî the equivalent of as much as 14% of its current data center capacity, at a bare minimum ‚Äî on top of the ‚Äúcouple hundred‚Äù (at least 200) megawatts of data center leases that it‚Äôs outright canceled. I do not know why nobody else has done this analysis. I have now read every single piece about the TD Cowen report from every single outlet that covered it. I am astounded by the lack of curiosity as to what ‚Äú1GW+‚Äù means in a report that meaningfully moved markets, as I am equally astounded by the lack of curiosity to contextualize most tech news. It is as if nobody wants to think about this too hard ‚Äî that nobody wants to stop the party, to accept what‚Äôs been staring us in the face since last year, and when given the most egregious, glaring evidence they must find ways to dismiss it rather than give it the energy it deserves. Far more resources were dedicated to finding ways to gussy up the releases of Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Sonnet 3.7 or OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4.5 than were given to the report from an investment bank‚Äôs research wing that the largest spender in generative AI ‚Äî the largest backer (for now) of OpenAI ‚Äî is massively reducing its expenditures in the data centers required for the industry (and for OpenAI, a company ostensibly worth at least $157 billion, and which Microsoft owns the largest stake) to expand. Microsoft‚Äôs stake in OpenAI is a bit fuzzy, as OpenAI doesn‚Äôt issue traditional equity, and there‚Äôs a likelihood it may be diluted as more money comes in. It reportedly owned 49% in 2023. Assuming that‚Äôs still the case, are we to believe that Microsoft is willing to strangle an asset worth at least $75bn (several times more than its investment to date) by cancelling a few leases? How many more alarms do we need to go off before people recognize that something bad is happening? Why is it that tangible, meaningful evidence that we‚Äôre in a bubble ‚Äî and possibly a sign that it has actually popped ‚Äî is less interesting than the fact that Claude Sonnet 3.7 ‚Äúcan think longer‚Äù? I do not write this newsletter to ‚Äúbe right.‚Äù I do not write it to ‚Äúbe a cynic‚Äù or ‚Äúhater.‚Äù I write this because I am trying to understand what‚Äôs going on, and if I do not do that I will actually go insane. Every time I sit down to write it is because I am trying to understand what it is that‚Äôs happening and how I feel about it, and these are the only terms that dictate my newsletter. It just happens that I have stared at the tech industry for too long, and now I can‚Äôt look away. Perhaps it is driving me mad, perhaps I am getting smarter, or some combination of the two, but what comes out of it is not driven by wanting to ‚Äúgo viral‚Äù or ‚Äúhave a hot take,‚Äù because such things suggest that I would write something different if three people read it versus the 57,000 that subscribe. I am not saying that Microsoft is dying, or making any grandiose claims about what happens next. What I am describing is the material contraction of the largest investor in data centers according to TD Cowen, potentially at a scale that suggests that it has meaningfully reduced its interest in further expansion of data centers writ large. This is a deeply concerning move, one that suggests that Microsoft does not see enough demand to sustain its current expansions, which has greater ramifications beyond generative AI, because it suggests that there isn‚Äôt any other reason for it to expand the means of delivering software. What has Satya Nadella seen? What is Microsoft CFO Amy Hood doing? What is the plan here? And really, what‚Äôs the plan with OpenAI? SoftBank has committed to over $40 billion of costs that it cannot currently afford, taking on as much as $24 billion in debt in the next year to help sustain one more funding round and the construction of data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses money on literally every single customer. To survive, OpenAI must continue raising more money than any startup has ever raised before, and they are only able to do so from SoftBank, which in turn must take on debt. OpenAI burned $5 billion in 2024, will likely burn $11 billion in 2025, and will continue burning money in perpetuity, and to scale further will require further funding for a data center project funded partially by funding from a company taking on debt to fund them. And when you put all of this together, all that I can see is a calamity. Generative AI does not have meaningful mass-market use cases, and while ChatGPT may have 400 million weekly active users, as I described last week, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be meaningful consumer adoption outside of ChatGPT, mostly because almost all AI coverage inevitably ends up marketing one company: OpenAI. Argue with me all you want about your personal experiences with ChatGPT, or how you‚Äôve found it personally useful. That doesn‚Äôt make it a product with mass-market utility, or enterprise utility, or worth the vast sums of money being ploughed into generative AI. Worse still, there doesn‚Äôt appear to be meaningful revenue. As discussed above, Microsoft claims $13 billion in annual recurring revenue (not profit) on all AI products combined on over $200 billion of capital expenditures since 2023, and no other hyperscaler is willing to break out any AI revenue at all. Not Amazon. Not Meta. Not Google. Nobody. Where is the growth? Where is all this money going? Why is Microsoft canceling a Gigawatt of data center capacity while telling everybody that it didn‚Äôt have enough data centers to handle demand for its AI products? I suppose there‚Äôs one way of looking at it: that Microsoft may currently have a capacity issue, but soon won‚Äôt, meaning that further expansion is unnecessary. If that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôll be interesting to see whether their peers follow suit. Either way, I see nothing that suggests that there‚Äôs further growth in generative AI. In fact, I think it‚Äôs time for everybody to seriously consider that big tech burned billions of dollars on something that nobody really wanted. If you read this and scoff ‚Äî what should I have written about? Anthropic adding a sliding ‚Äúthinking‚Äù bar to a model? GPT-4.5? Who cares! Can you even tell me what it does differently to GPT-4o? Can you explain to me why it matters? Or are you more interested in nakedly-captured imbeciles like Ethan Mollick sweatily oinking about how powerful the latest Large Language Models are to notice the real things happening in the real world with buildings and silicon and actual infrastructure? Wake the fuck up, everybody! Things are on fire. I get it. It‚Äôs scary to move against the consensus. But people are wondering, right now, why you didn‚Äôt write about this, and indeed why you seem more concerned with protecting the current market hype cycle than questioning it. There are no ‚Äúphony comforts of being an AI skeptic‚Äù ‚Äî what I am writing about here, as I regularly remind you, is extremely scary stuff. If I‚Äôm right, tech‚Äôs only growth story is dead.

Title: Ecommerce: 50 Essential Elements for an Optimized and High-Conversion Product Detail Page
URL: https://martech.zone/ecommerce-product-page-checklist/
Time Published: 2025-03-13T21:47:23Z
Full Content:
A Product Detail Page (PDP) is the dedicated page on an E-commerce website where customers can find all the relevant information about a specific product. This page is a digital storefront, offering a comprehensive overview of the product‚Äôs features, benefits, specifications, pricing, and purchasing options. A well-optimized PDP informs potential buyers and enhances their shopping experience, builds trust, and ultimately drives conversions. To be effective, a PDP should be designed with user experience, search engine optimization (SEO), and conversion rate optimization (CRO) in mind, ensuring that customers receive all the necessary details to make an informed purchase decision. The above-the-fold section refers to the content immediately visible when a customer lands on the product page without needing to scroll. This is the most critical area of the PDP as it creates the first impression and determines whether the visitor will continue engaging with the product or leave. Essential elements in this section include the product‚Äôs name, pricing, availability, images, and a compelling call-to-action (CTA). Additionally, trust signals like star ratings, security badges, and social proof help reassure potential buyers. An effectively designed above-the-fold section ensures that customers receive all vital information upfront, reducing hesitation and encouraging immediate action. Once a customer scrolls past the initial view, the below-the-fold section offers more comprehensive details about the product. This includes extended product descriptions, technical specifications, customer reviews, FAQs, and warranty or return policies. At this stage, shoppers are seeking additional validation before making a purchase decision. Providing in-depth information and user-generated content, such as ratings and testimonials, can help alleviate doubts and reinforce trust. This section also presents opportunities for cross-selling and upselling by showcasing related or complementary products. A well-structured below-the-fold section ensures that customers stay engaged and feel confident in their decision. The footer of a product detail page plays a vital role in reinforcing credibility and guiding users toward additional resources. It typically contains links to company policies, customer service contacts, main product categories, and social media pages. This section also often includes newsletter signup forms, which help brands capture leads for future marketing efforts. By providing easily accessible support and policy information, the footer enhances transparency and ensures that customers have the necessary resources to complete their purchase confidently. Search engine optimization (SEO) is a crucial aspect of a well-optimized PDP, ensuring that the product page ranks highly in search engine results. Businesses can improve their visibility and attract more organic traffic by incorporating structured metadata, relevant keywords, optimized URLs, and high-quality images with alt tags. Additionally, a clear and structured page hierarchy and integration with analytics tools help track performance and refine strategies for better conversions. A PDP that follows best SEO practices increases discoverability and enhances user experience and engagement. Behind every well-functioning PDP lies a strong technical foundation. The technical requirements of a product page include mobile responsiveness, fast loading speeds, cross-browser compatibility, and a secure checkout process. Customers expect a seamless and intuitive shopping experience, and any delays or technical issues can result in lost sales. Optimizing for performance, minimizing third-party scripts, and ensuring scalability for high-traffic periods are all essential for maintaining a reliable and efficient product page. A technically sound PDP guarantees that users can browse, engage, and complete transactions effortlessly, leading to higher customer satisfaction and retention. I‚Äôm going to add a 50th element that can be incorporated throughout a PDP. Optimizing each section can help businesses create a highly effective product detail page that improves conversions, enhances user experience, and strengthens brand trust. A well-structured product detail page (PDP) is essential for converting visitors into customers. Each element enhances user experience, improves trust, and increases sales. By implementing these 49 essential elements, you can create a high-performing product detail page that improves user experience, increases trust, and drives more conversions.

Title: An early TikTok investor is $17 billion richer this year, making him the wealthiest man in finance after Warren Buffett

Many of the world's wealthiest people have taken heavy blows to their personal fortunes this year as recession fears continue to weigh on stocks. Yet one Wall Street titan has leaped up the rich list, growing his net worth more than anybody else. Jeff Yass, the cofounder of Susquehanna International Group, has gained an unmatched $17.2 billion in wealth this year as of Wednesday's close, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. In contrast, Elon Musk has had $113 billion wiped off his net worth as Tesla stock has tanked 39% this year. Oracle's Larry Ellison, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Dell Technologies' Michael Dell, Alphabet's Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, and Microsoft's Steve Ballmer have each had at least $12 billion of their wealth erased too. Yass' gain this year has boosted his personal fortune from about $47 billion to $63 billion, ranking him 23rd on the wealth index. He's now the richest man in finance after Warren Buffett, the fourth-biggest gainer with a $13.4 billion rise this year. The wealth surge for Yass, 66, stems from an early investment in ByteDance. He still owns about 7% of the Chinese social media company behind TikTok. ByteDance intends to repurchase employees' shares at a valuation of about $312 billion, up from $268 billion at the end of 2023, Bloomberg recently reported. Moreover, ByteDance investors SoftBank, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price have raised their internal valuation estimates to north of $400 billion. The upshot is Yass' reported stake may have jumped in value by roughly 50% in a little over a year. Susquehanna is also worth almost $50 billion, and Yass owns upward of 51% of the firm, regulatory filings show. Yass didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Yass is a Republican mega-donor who supported President Donald Trump's campaign. He's benefited from the US leader's decision to extend the deadline for ByteDance to sell TikTok and its US operations over national security concerns. Trump said last year that banning TikTok would make young Americans "go crazy," and he didn't want Mark Zuckerberg's Meta to sweep in and take its place. Art Dantchik, who cofounded Susquehanna with Yass and is also a ByteDance director, has seen his wealth jump by $6.5 billion to reach almost $17 billion this year, putting him in 122nd place on the rich list. Yass, 66, is the son of two accountants and graduated as a math major, he says in a video on Susquehanna's YouTube channel. He moved to Las Vegas and spent about 18 months playing poker before becoming an independent options trader. After realizing how lucrative the sector was, he recruited his poker buddies from college to work at his own firm. Games remain a core part of Susquehanna's culture, according to its website. Employees can take part in board game nights, complete puzzles dotted around the office, and compete in an annual poker tournament. Managers also use strategy games to teach lessons to new employees.

BREAKING NEWS Aamer Madhani Associated Press Published: March 13, 2025 at 8:39 AM Updated: March 13, 2025 at 4:50 PM Aamer Madhani Associated Press Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Toronto residents Douglas Bloomfield, left, and his son Phoenix, right, who are on vacation in Washington, hold a Canadian flag and an ice hockey stick to show their support for Canada regarding trade tariffs as they pose with with another visitor to the city wearing a mask of President Donald Trump in front of the White House in Washington, Thursday, March 13, 2025. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis) WASHINGTON ‚Äì President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened a 200% tariff on European wine, Champagne and spirits if the European Union goes forward with a planned tariff on American whiskey. The European import tax, which was unveiled in response to steel and aluminum tariffs by the U.S. administration, is expected to go into effect April 1, just ahead of separate reciprocal tariffs that Trump plans to place on the EU. Recommended Videos But Trump, in a morning social media post, vowed a new escalation in his trade war if the EU goes forward with the planned 50% tax on American whiskey. ‚ÄúIf this Tariff is not removed immediately, the U.S. will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,‚Äù Trump wrote. ‚ÄúThis will be great for the Wine and Champagne businesses in the U.S.‚Äù European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday that the EU trade commissioner would be having a phone call Friday with his U.S. counterpart. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt like tariffs because we think tariffs are taxes and they are bad for business and they are bad for consumers," she said. "We have always said at the same time that we will defend our interests. We‚Äôve said it, and we‚Äôve shown it, but at the same time I also want to emphasize that we are open for negotiations.‚Äù The U.S. president has defined his opening weeks in the White House with near daily drama regarding tariffs, saying that taxing imports might cause some economic pain but would eventually lead to more domestic manufacturing and greater respect for America. The S&P 500 stock index fell 1.4% on Thursday, while European alcohol stocks also tumbled. But with the EU and Trump now tussling over alcohol tariffs, the impact of a trade war could surface directly in ways consumers could quickly see. It's unclear how the import taxes would be absorbed among vintners, distillers, brewers, distributors, retailers and consumers. Because of Trump's threat, a previously untariffed $15 bottle of Italian Prosecco could possibly increase in price to $45. Similarly, Europe's response to Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs means that the cost of a 30-euro bottle of bourbon in Paris could increase to 45 euros. Holly Seidewand, owner of First Fill Spirits, a shop in Saratoga Springs, New York, said before Trump threatened the tariffs on European alcohol, the spirits industry was already reeling from layoff announcements in the Kentucky Bourbon sector and the tariffs planned by the EU on American spirits. ‚ÄúThis ongoing tariff war doesn‚Äôt just harm importers ‚Äî it weakens domestic brands, disrupts distributors, and squeezes retailers who rely on global selections,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIn the end, consumers will bear the brunt of it all." Gabriel Picard, who heads the French Federation of Exporters of Wines and Spirits, said 200% tariffs would be ‚Äúa hammer blow‚Äù for the sector. He said the U.S. market is worth 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion) annually for French exporters of wines and spirits. ‚ÄúNot a single bottle will continue to be expedited if 200% tariffs are applied to our products. All exports to the United States will come to a total, total, halt,‚Äù Picard said in an interview with The Associated Press. ‚ÄúWith 200% duties, there is no more market.‚Äù As of now, Europe seems unwilling to back down. ‚ÄúTrump is escalating the trade war he has chosen,‚Äù Laurent Saint-Martin, the French delegate minister for foreign trade, said on X. ‚ÄúFrance, together with the European Commission and our partners, is determined to fight back. We will not give in to threats and will always protect our industries.‚Äù Trump's latest tariff threats suggested that even companies that have publicly stood by him could be collateral damage, raising questions about whether the wider business community would be willing to openly challenge a series of trade wars that have hurt the stock market and scared consumers who worry about inflation worsening. Bernard Arnault, the CEO of French luxury goods company LVMH, attended Trump's inauguration in January. His company's wine and spirits brands, which include Mo√´t & Chandon, Krug, Veuve Clicquot and Hennessy, could be subject to the retaliatory tariffs the U.S. president is seeking. The Italy-based Campari Group could also be hurt, after the White House highlighted it at Tuesday's press briefing for possibly opening a U.S. factory. Still, Trump feels aggrieved by the EU, complaining to reporters on Thursday about the lack of U.S. auto sales there as well as the lawsuits and fines filed against Google and Facebook parent Meta. ‚ÄúThey are suing all of these companies, and they‚Äôre taking billions of dollars out of American companies,‚Äù Trump said. ‚ÄúAnd I guess they‚Äôre using it to run Europe or something.‚Äù Trump, in announcing the new steel and aluminum tariffs on Wednesday, openly challenged U.S. allies and vowed to take back wealth ‚Äústolen‚Äù by other countries, and he drew quick retaliation. He has separate tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, with plans to also tax imports from the European Union, Brazil and South Korea by charging ‚Äúreciprocal‚Äù rates starting on April 2. The EU announced its own countermeasures. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that as the United States was ‚Äúapplying tariffs worth 28 billion dollars, we are responding with countermeasures worth 26 billion euros,‚Äù or about $28 billion. Those measures cover not just steel and aluminum products but also textiles, home appliances and agricultural goods. European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Thursday shortly before Trump's announcement that the EU was "prepared for whatever might come, and we have been preparing for over a year.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe call on the U.S. to immediately revoke the tariffs imposed yesterday, and we want to negotiate to avoid tariffs in the future,‚Äù Gill added. "They bring nothing but lose-lose outcomes, and we want to focus on win-win outcomes.‚Äù U.S. whiskey makers, meanwhile, encouraged Trump to broker a deal. ‚ÄúWe urge President Trump to secure a spirits agreement with the EU to get us back to zero-for-zero tariffs, which will create U.S. jobs and increase manufacturing and exports for the American hospitality sector," Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council, said in a statement. When Europe responded to Trump's 2018 tariffs with a 25% tax on U.S. whiskey, exports to the EU fell by 20% through 2021, according to the Distilled Spirits Council. Trump's separate 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico could put 31,000 jobs at risk in the sector. ___ AP writers Lorne Cook in Brussels, Samuel Petrequin and John Leicester in Paris, Mae Anderson, Dee-Ann Durbin and Mike Warren contributed reporting.

Title: How Increasing Global Demand And Competition Are Driving The Edge Revolution
URL: https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/03/13/how-increasing-global-demand-and-competition-are-driving-the-edge-revolution/

ByMark Mahle ByMark Mahle , Forbes Councils Member. Mark Mahle is CEO of NetActuate. The global race is on to build enough edge data centers to keep up with sky-high demand. The worldwide edge data center market is projected to reach $317 billion by 2026, a 107% surge since its $153 billion valuation in 2020, but this number doesn‚Äôt tell the whole story. Edge computing and AI are revolutionizing entire industries‚Äîfrom manufacturing and transportation to healthcare and retail‚Äîand these developments will likely result in trillions of dollars of true economic impact. U.S. business leaders can‚Äôt sit back and wait for the next chapter to unfold. Profound changes, driven by an increased need for computing power, advanced hardware, strategic investments and partnerships, are redrawing the global tech map and making it clear that we need to act now to remain competitive. AI‚Äôs exponential growth is only amplifying our need for robust edge infrastructure to support it. Even as AI models become more efficient, there is still unrelenting demand for AI that is better and faster. If a new model promises to perform 10 times more efficiently than the leading model, it won't be long until we want it to run 100 times faster. We're missing the forest for the trees if we think efficiency gains will slow our need for greater computing power. The new era of AI also requires substantial hardware resources. In 2024, Deloitte research estimated that total AI chip sales that year would account for 11% of the $576 billion global market: "Growing from roughly $US50 billion today, the AI chip market is forecasted to reach up to US$400 billion by 2027, though a more conservative estimate is US$110 billion." Nvidia is leading the AI chip market, but the industry is in an ongoing arms race for accelerated hardware performance. Nvidia originally designed its chips to enhance computer graphics, not power AI models, and startups are now creating chips specifically optimized for AI workloads. The power demands of AI are enormous and continue to rise. Due to increasing generative AI usage, "electricity consumption by data centers is forecasted to double to 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030," according to a recent Deloitte study. The tech industry, including giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, is rethinking its approach to meet these growing energy requirements by investing in nuclear technology. Three Mile Island, a nuclear power plant that closed in 2019, is reopening after Microsoft signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Constellation. Nuclear energy must play a critical‚Äîand urgent‚Äîrole in supporting future AI and edge developments. Based on reports from Goldman Sachs Research, ‚Äú85-90 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear capacity would be needed to meet all of the data center power demand growth expected by 2030 (relative to 2023). But well less than 10% will be available globally by 2030.‚Äù China is executing an ambitious long-term strategy to be the world leader in AI by 2030. AI has the potential to add $600 billion annually to China‚Äôs economy. The Chinese government has invested heavily in a multipronged approach to AI and edge infrastructure innovation. China‚Äôs focus on AI ecosystem innovation, research and development and supply chain ownership extends all the way to the technology‚Äôs basic components, including mining and refining in-demand minerals necessary for building semiconductors. The U.S. tech sector is watching China with justifiable concern: The country‚Äôs immense domestic AI footprint is having a global impact. In January, Chinese AI startup DeepSeek released an AI model similar to ChatGPT called R1 and caused U.S. tech stocks to plummet. Nvidia's stock price dropped 17% in a day before starting to recover the following day. For tech companies in the U.S. and other countries in Europe and emerging markets, this is a pivotal moment. As business leaders, we have the opportunity to respond to China‚Äôs growth with both competitive investments and open-market collaboration. Mutually beneficial global partnerships with allies, such as EU countries and India, will allow us to align our interests, share knowledge, innovate and drive business outcomes. We need to stay competitive by building more self-sufficient, resilient supply chains and finding the right balance of technological innovation and regulation. This shift will require substantial collective investments in next-generation hardware, software, training and infrastructure. AI is reshaping every sector, and we are only beginning to realize its true economic value. The decisions we make now will enable our collective ability to flourish on a global scale.

March 12, 2025 18:45 ET | Source: DiCello Levitt LLP DiCello Levitt LLP SAN DIEGO, March 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A class action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ: APP) (‚ÄúAppLovin‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) securities between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025 (the ‚ÄúClass Period‚Äù), charging the Company and certain senior executives with violations of the federal securities laws (collectively, ‚ÄúDefendants‚Äù).

Case Allegations AppLovin is a mobile advertising technology business that operates a software-based platform to connect mobile game developers to new users. The Company operates through two segments: Software Platform and Apps. The AppLovin lawsuit alleges that Defendants made false and/or materially misleading statements about AppLovin‚Äôs enhanced digital ad platform, AXON 2.0, and its ‚Äúcutting-edge AI technologies,‚Äù including that AXON 2.0 would more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. In reality, AppLovin was reverse engineering data from Meta Platforms and utilizing manipulative practices to force customers into unknowingly installing apps via a ‚Äúbackdoor installation scheme‚Äù which artificially inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, AppLovin‚Äôs profit figures. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when Fuzzy Panda and Culper Research published separate short seller reports calling into question the integrity of Axon 2.0 and AppLovin‚Äôs ad practices. Specifically, the Fuzzy Panda report stated that Axon 2.0 was simply ‚Äúa House of Cards‚Äù built on fraudulent advertising tactics, including ‚Äústealing data from Meta‚Äù and ‚Äúexploiting consumers and their data in ways‚Äù that violate Google and Apple‚Äôs app store policies. Similarly, the Culper Research report claims AppLovin employs Axon 2.0 ‚Äúlargely as a promotional tool ‚Äì a smokescreen to hide the true drivers of its mobile gaming and e-commerce initiatives‚Äù and that the Company‚Äôs ‚Äúrecent success in mobile gaming stems from the systematic exploitation of app permissions that enable advertisements themselves to force-feed silent, backdoor app installations directly onto users‚Äô phones.‚Äù On this news, the price of AppLovin common stock fell $46.06 per share from a closing price of $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025, to a closing price of $331 per share on January 26, 2025, a decline of 12.21% on heavy volume.

Title: META Stock Headed To $200?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/03/12/meta-stock-headed-to-200/
Time Published: 2025-03-12T09:00:55Z

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. META Stock Question: How would you feel if you owned Meta Platforms stock and its value dropped 50%, or even 70%, over the next few months? It may sound extreme, but it has happened before ‚Äì and it could happen again. Meta has shown greater stability so far this year, maintaining share prices similar to those in January, while the NASDAQ index has fallen by approximately 10%. Recently, the stock faced pressure after President Trump‚Äôs comments opened the possibility of a recession, thereby increasing investor uncertainty. Furthermore, worries have grown with the introduction of Manus, a new AI assistant from China that is intensifying competition in the sector. Rising economic concerns in the United States, spurred by President Trump‚Äôs tariff implementation, are creating an unfavorable market environment. We believe META stock could decline further to levels as low as $200 per share. Here‚Äôs why investors should be concerned. The key point is this: during a downturn, META stock could suffer significant losses. Evidence from as recently as 2022 shows that META stock lost over 70% of its value in just a few quarters. So, could META‚Äôs roughly $600 share price drop to below $200 if 2022 were to repeat itself? Naturally, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios ‚Äì so if you are seeking upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Although META‚Äôs AI investments are yielding higher user engagement, investors were disappointed by the company‚Äôs quarterly forecast. Meta continues to make substantial infrastructure investments to support its AI initiatives, with 2025 capital expenditures projected at $60-65 billion. Despite DeepSeek‚Äôs AI model potentially reducing computing requirements, Meta‚Äôs leadership maintains that significant resources are still necessary to run AI models‚Äîjustifying continued heavy infrastructure spending. Nevertheless, DeepSeek‚Äôs advancements and the recent launch of Manus suggest that powerful AI models might be developed at lower costs, intensifying competition and pressuring Meta to evolve its AI technologies such as Llama. From a macroeconomic standpoint, President Trump‚Äôs trade policies may negatively impact META. The administration has doubled Chinese import tariffs from 10% to 20% on top of existing levies, and Trump recently proposed a ‚Äú25% or higher‚Äù tariff on all imported semiconductor chips. These policies could further escalate Meta‚Äôs already significant AI infrastructure costs. Moreover, reduced consumer spending due to tariff-induced price hikes might hurt advertising-dependent businesses, potentially undermining Meta‚Äôs revenue streams. META stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. Although investors are hopeful for a soft landing of the U.S. economy, how severe could the impact be if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. ‚Ä¢ META stock dropped 73.7% from a high of $338.54 on 3 January 2022 to $88.91 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 November 2023 ‚Ä¢ Subsequently, the stock climbed to a high of $736.67 on 17 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $6o0 ‚Ä¢ META stock declined by 32.9% from a high of $217.49 on 19 February 2020 to $146.01 on 16 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 ‚Ä¢ The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 20 May 2020 In conclusion, the situation is compounded by the fact that META stock remains expensive; it currently trades at almost 25x trailing earnings, compared to the stock‚Äôs average price-to-earnings ratio of 21x over the last three years. While Meta Platforms‚Äô Revenues have grown considerably over recent years‚Äîrising at an average rate of 12.2% over the last 3 years (versus 9.8% for the S&P 500)‚Äîthis growth could quickly fade if the economy turns for the worse. Considering this slowdown in growth and the broader economic uncertainties, ask yourself the question: do you want to hold onto your META stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins dropping to $400, $300, or even lower levels? Holding onto a declining stock is never easy. Trefis collaborates with Empirical Asset Management‚Äîa Boston-area wealth manager‚Äîwhose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; offering a less turbulent ride, as demonstrated by the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: What does a 'slow motion sell-down' mean for our superannuation?

(ABC News: John Gunn) The benchmark ASX 200 share index is closing in on a "correction", a fall of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. Much of the roughly $4 trillion of Australian superannuation balances is invested in shares, here and abroad. Analysts are divided on whether this is a minor correction or may be the start of a bigger share market decline. The Australian share market is now close to what financial market participants call a "technical correction". That is, a fall in the benchmark S&P/ASX200 of 10 per cent or more from its all-time high. The index reached that high last month, closing at 8,555. About 12:30pm AEDT it was 7,765 index points. Veteran stockbroker Marcus Padley said the market was not panicking, but nor had it found a bottom or floor yet. "I don't think it's looking particularly precipitous," he told the ABC. "The VIX index," he says, which is recognised as the benchmark gauge of financial market fear, "that spikes when something precipitous is going on". "At the moment it has crept higher, so this looks like a slow motion sell-down," Mr Padley added. Marcus Padley says the market is not panicking, but has not found a floor yet. (ABC News) Putting aside tariff and US economic concerns, Mr Padley said a key catalyst for this share market sell-off was the corporate reporting season in America and Australia, as well as China's threat to America's artificial intelligence dominance. "It's been caused by Deep Seek and the Nvidia [earnings results], and the end of the [corporate reporting] season, and a news void that we've gotten into,‚Äù he said. "That has been a catalyst for a loss of sentiment after a two-year bull market." So, when does the market stop falling? "Not sure," Mr Padley responded. "It really depends on the US, it depends on big tech, and big tech has been overpriced." Analysts look at the price to earnings multiples for stocks as a key gauge of whether they are valued fairly in the market. It's a ratio that compares the price of a stock to the company's profits per share. The so-called "magnificent 7" in the US: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla have an average P/E of about 32.7 times (excluding Tesla). "The P/E should probably, based on broader market averages, be around 25 times," Mr Padley said. "So, you can see if we got into a bear market, we could see it 10 per cent lower than this." A bear market is a lengthy sell-down in the share market, taking the index 20 per cent or lower from its peak. That seems to be a possibility according to some market participants. Danielle Ecuyer says the selling on global financial markets relates to the potential for growing trade wars. (Facebook: Shareplicity) Financial markets commentator Danielle Ecuyer from FN Arena said the selling on global financial markets, including Australia, was "absolutely relentless". "Predominantly it relates to the potential for growing trade wars across the world thanks to the tariff policy from the new Trump administration," Ms Ecuyer said. "And clearly uncertainty. Just uncertainty about where the world is heading, Australia's exposure to China, because we don't have a huge trade exposure to the US. "And investors, clearly at the moment, they don't like uncertainty, it feels very risk-off, and they're just taking profits. "Plus, there's uncertainty around whether the US economy is going to slow." Millions of Australians have superannuation, with total savings balances currently worth about $4 trillion. So, what influence could the local and US share market have on those superannuation account balances? Many analysts, such as AMP's chief economist Shane Oliver, are sanguine, given the recent strong run-up in investment returns. "Superannuation funds have had two very good years in terms of returns, and so it's par for the course that you do go through bouts of volatility every so often," he told The Business earlier this week. Kirby Rappell from SuperRatings sought to remind savers that superannuation is a long-term investment. "You can be alert, but you don't need to be alarmed," he told The Business. "If you think about the GFC, during COVID ‚Ä¶ these blips happen. The key thing is about being able to hold your nerve." However, market analysts warn that the short-term volatility is likely to continue. "The key thing will be, as it always is, earnings growth for the companies here in Australia," Ms Ecuyer said. "And quite frankly the February reporting season wasn't fabulous. "So for our market to buck the trend we'd have to see the earnings outlook not deteriorating and the problem for some companies is that they're actually seeing their exposure to the US, and their North American earnings, starting to come under pressure. "I guess if investors have gone into this period ‚Äì when markets were at very high, elevated valuations ‚Äì and they're extremely overweight equities, then clearly they've put themselves at risk of a short-term correction, or more in markets." Marcus Padley warned investors to be wary of the potential for a black swan event, or news that sparks a major, sudden sell-down in stocks globally. "We saw some remarkable volume in some exchange-traded funds called SNAS or Short-NASDAQ. "That happened just before the DeepSeek moment." Earlier this year an update from Chinese tech company Deep Seek presented global markets with an alternative artificial intelligence investment to Nvidia. "So, certainly, there are hedge funds who are out to make money in any circumstance, who take large bets on outcomes that nobody else is aware of," Mr Padley said. "If they do know something, it's not apparent to the rest of us. "[But] I don't see that sort of pre-collapse volume in SNAS or other bearish ETFs at the moment." The prime minister says the United States, if it is a friend, needs to act in a way that reinforces "the fact that we are friends" after the Trump administration confirms no exemptions will be granted to US steel and aluminium tariffs on Australia. Chris Brycki is the CEO of investment firm Stockspot. His firm invests on behalf of mainly younger Australians looking to build their wealth. While not offering any investment advice, he said younger Australians should take a proactive interest in the share market now. "I think for young people in Australia the share market is just a great opportunity to build wealth without needing to invest in property, which most people can't anyway," he argued. "You don't want all your eggs in one basket and just owning Australian shares, or just a few tech companies, you want to own some government bonds as well, because that's an asset that does well when there's a recession. "And if you have a few balancing assets in your portfolio, it can really smooth the bumps in periods like we're seeing now." As for older Australians in or approaching retirement? "There are a few moving parts, but I think the people that have a diversified and well-balanced portfolio ‚Äì they don't really need to lose any sleep," Mr Brycki added.

Title: If You Think Tesla‚Äôs Stock Is Bad, Check Out Trump‚Äôs Truth Social

Time Published: 2025-03-11T20:15:53Z

Chris Kleponis/POOL/Abaca/Sipa USA Donald Trump took to Truth Social Monday night to offer support to his most important political ally, promising to buy a ‚Äúbrand new Tesla‚Äù as a ‚Äúshow of confidence.‚Äù Elon Musk‚Äôs electric car company has been rocked by protests in recent weeks, and its share price has fallen by more than 50 percent since its post-election peak in mid-December. But Musk isn‚Äôt the only member of the administration with a company that is plummeting in value: Trump‚Äôs own business has been suffering, as well. A week before the election last fall, the stock price for Trump Media & Technology Group‚Äîwhich operates Truth Social‚Äî spiked to $51.51. But thanks to an unrelenting string of bad news about the company‚Äôs business prospects‚Äîalong with the consequences of Trump‚Äôs economic policies, which have sent nearly all stocks plunging‚Äîthe company‚Äôs shares briefly fell below $19 on Tuesday. In some ways, Trump‚Äôs business predicament appears more significant than Musk‚Äôs. Tesla is confronting steeply declining levels of consumer interest, but it still earns substantial revenue and owns major assets. Truth Social‚Äôs financials, by contrast, have since the very beginning been bad‚Äîand downright inexplicable for a company that is said to be worth $4 billion (even at the greatly reduced share prices of late). For a company that, in theory, has the eyes of the world on its biggest user, Truth Social had just $3.6 million in revenue in 2024. To put that in context, according to a recent review of fast food restaurant chains, Trump‚Äôs entire social media operation had less revenue than the average Chik-Fil-A, Raising Canes, What-a-Burger, or Shake Shack location‚Äîand just barely more in sales than your typical McDonald‚Äôs. If that‚Äôs an odd comparison to make, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs almost impossible to compare Truth Social‚Äôs revenue to other social media companies‚ÄîFacebook and Instagram owner Meta booked $164.5 billion in revenue in 2024. That‚Äôs about 45,500 times more revenue than Truth Social. Those lousy revenue numbers would suggest that the company‚Äôs profitability is also lousy‚Äîand that‚Äôs absolutely true. In its 2024 year-end filings, Truth Social reported losing more than $400 million. But it‚Äôs not just the fact that the company has scant advertising sales and few users. It also seems to be spending money in odd and unhelpful ways‚Äîit paid Trump‚Äôs eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., $813,000 (or almost a quarter of its revenue) just for showing up at board meetings. And company CEO Devin Nunes has made at least $6.3 million running the company since 2022, a stunning figure for a firm that is struggling to earn any money. Investors might be able to forgive that pay arrangement if there appeared to be real innovation happening at the company. But in the last month, some of company‚Äôs press releases have trumpeted rather mundane accomplishments, including: Since Trump‚Äôs Truth Social post Monday, Tesla‚Äôs stock has seen a small rebound‚Äîup about 4 percent, as of Tuesday afternoon. Truth Social was down slightly for the day. Based on its current price, Trump‚Äôs stake in the company is now worth about $3 billion less than it was in October.

Title: Even as US slashes jobs, ‚Äòit is the calm before the storm‚Äô, economists warn

An upcoming trade war and more DOGE job cuts will hammer the US economy, economists warn. The first major set of economic reports last week reflect the state of the United States economy during President Donald Trump‚Äôs first full month in office. The data reveal a spike in layoffs and slower hiring growth across both the public and private sectors, with looming cuts suggesting larger economic woes in the months ahead. The US economy added 151,000 jobs, according to the Labor Department report, which came out on Friday ‚Äì well short of economist expectations showing a stall in economic growth. Approximately 7.1 million Americans are currently receiving unemployment benefits compared with 6.5 million this time last year. ‚ÄúI think the real risk here is that if Trump doesn‚Äôt reverse course on what he‚Äôs doing, it could be his last boring report, which I think would be really damaging to the economy. If you look under the hood, I think we are starting to see pretty foreboding cracks,‚Äù Elizabeth Pancotti, the managing director of policy and advocacy at the economic think tank Groundwork Collective, told Al Jazeera. The White House painted an alternative picture. ‚ÄúIn one month under President Trump, the American economy is soaring back to greatness after the economic calamity left by Joe Biden,‚Äù White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Former President Biden, however, was lauded as leading the best economic recovery in the world following the global economic downturn amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody‚Äôs Analytics, said that last week‚Äôs numbers are probably the best we will get in a while amid looming layoffs and tariff fears. ‚ÄúThis is the calm before the storm, before we start to see the fallout in the job market from the trade war and the DOGE cuts, and other economic policies from Trump,‚Äù Zandi told Al Jazeera. DOGE is the newly created Department of Government Efficiency, which is led by ardent Trump supporter, billionaire Elon Musk. Those concerns, coming on the back of comments that Trump made over the weekend declining to rule out an impending US recession, reverberated through the stock market on Monday when the S&P 500 lost 155.21 points, or 2.69 percent, to end the day at 5,614.99 points. This is the first time it finished below its 200-day moving average ‚Äì a closely watched support level ‚Äì since November 2023. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 726.01 points, or 3.99 percent, to 17,470.21 ‚Äì its biggest single-day decline since September 2022, according to CNN. The Dow Jones Industrial Average also fell 890.63 points, or 2.08 percent, to 41,911.09. There are key indicators that point to this getting worse in the months to come. The index which shows how many people took on part-time work including because they were unable to find full-time work or have had their hours reduced, increased by 460,000 from the month prior, to 4.9 million people. ‚ÄúThis is the shortest honeymoon period we‚Äôve ever seen if you are 50 days on the job. He inherited on paper a pretty stable, pretty solid economy and it is already deteriorating after 50 days. I don‚Äôt think that that‚Äôs ever happened,‚Äù Pancotti added. Since Trump took office, DOGE has cut almost 33,000 people across the federal government, according to Layoff.fyi, which tracks federal government and tech sector layoffs. Because of ongoing court cases, the official count from the Labor Department is 10,000 jobs. The layoffs include employees at the US Agency for International Development (USAID), the National Park Service, the National Institutes of Health, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of Energy, among many other government agencies. The number of public sector cuts is expected to increase as many of the recent DOGE cuts came after the end of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (a division of the Labor Department) reporting period for the month closed. Earlier this month, the Trump Administration announced its plans to cut 80,000 employees from the Department of Veteran Affairs. The president has also called for the dissolution of the Department of Education, even though that can only be done by an act of Congress. The global investment firm Apollo forecasts that when considering federal contractors on top of full-time employees, the federal workforce cuts could account for close to 1 million jobs lost. In last week‚Äôs jobs report from the Labor Department, the biggest gains were in the healthcare sector, which added 52,000 jobs. However, looming healthcare cuts could make those gains very short-lived. ‚ÄúIf we‚Äôre looking at massive Medicaid cuts ‚Äì we‚Äôre already seeing [National Institutes of Health] NIH and health research cuts ‚Äì Medicare cuts are on the table. All of those really could threaten the sector that is driving a lot of those job gains,‚Äù Pancotti continued. The downstream effect has already hit the private sector, which relies on federal funds. A private sector worker in Texas, who spoke to Al Jazeera under the condition of anonymity, said that the company they worked with had clients who were largely dependent on federal funds because of which business had dried up. ‚ÄúWe went from having a very busy-looking Q1 of 2025 to having absolutely nothing on the books within about a week of the inauguration,‚Äù the source told Al Jazeera. ‚ÄúNow that I am having to not spend any money whatsoever and do nothing but look for jobs, I‚Äôm not spending money in the economy. I‚Äôm not doing things like making improvements to my house. I would have paid contractors to do that. I‚Äôm within a couple of months of paying off the last of my student loans and now those are going to be paused until I find something new. Now, I have to worry if I can make the necessary trip to take my cat to the vet,‚Äù the source added. According to data from the Commerce Department, US consumers have cut back on spending for the first time in nearly two years. Others are worried about how they‚Äôre going to get by, like Kathlyn Clore who worked in audience engagement at The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, a nonprofit that received funding from USAID, until she was recently laid off. A single mom in Hawaii ‚Äì one of the single most expensive states where the average home price is well over $800,000 ‚Äì Clore has two kids. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on my own supporting my two kids. It‚Äôs just going to make that a lot more difficult to make it through this uncertainty,‚Äù Clore told Al Jazeera. ‚ÄúI keep wondering if Donald really thinks about what he‚Äôs doing to normal, middle-class people like me who are just trying to make a living and provide for their kids. Why does he want to make my life so much more difficult?‚Äù she added. Trump said on Friday: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre trying to shrink the government and grow the private sector. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been doing.‚Äù But layoffs in the private sector are also on the rise. The ADP, which tracks non-farm private payrolls added to the US economy over the previous month, showed the economy added 77,000 jobs, which is well short of the 148,000 economists otherwise expected. The leisure and hospitality sector, a notoriously low-paying set of industries, led the gains, adding 41,000 of those jobs. ‚ÄúPolicy uncertainty and a slowdown in consumer spending might have led to layoffs or a slowdown in hiring last month,‚Äù Nela Richardson, the chief economist at ADP, said in a statement. A separate report from Challenger, Gray and Christmas, which helps redundant employees find new employment, showed that in February alone, US employers announced job cuts of more than 172,000 ‚Äì a 245 percent increase from this time last month ‚Äì the highest jump since July 2020 during the height of the COVID pandemic. The jump in cuts showed the biggest annual increase since the height of the recession in February 2009. The retail sector led the cuts with a 572 percent increase in cuts across the industry compared with this time last year. The tech sector saw a wave of high-profile layoffs, continuing a theme that began last year. In 2024, the tech industry cut more than 157,000 jobs. Among those who made cuts in the last month include Meta ‚Äì Facebook and Instagram‚Äôs parent company ‚Äì which laid off 3,600 employees. The news comes only weeks after its CEO donated $1m to Trump‚Äôs inaugural fund. Jeff Bezos also donated $1m to Trump‚Äôs inaugural fund. Only weeks later, Aerospace giant Blue Origin, which Bezos runs, laid off 1,400 people. Alphabet ‚Äì Google‚Äôs parent company ‚Äì laid off roughly 100 people in February. It also donated $1m to Trump‚Äôs inaugural fund. CEOs of all of those companies attended Trump‚Äôs inauguration. Microsoft cut roughly 2,000 people from its workforce. Its CEO met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago golf club in January, only days before the inauguration. Other major companies including oil and gas giant Chevron announced pending layoffs last month. It comes as Chevron‚Äôs woes are about to get more substantial. The Trump Administration revoked the Houston, Texas-based oil and gas company‚Äôs licence to pump Venezuelan oil. Starbucks and Southwest Airlines also announced cuts in recent weeks. Trump‚Äôs economic policies, including his back and forth on tariffs and the subsequent retaliatory tariffs, will hinder the US workforce. Trump delayed 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico until April 2. This is the second time he put in place tariffs and then quickly pulled back. ‚ÄúThe trade war is even doing more damage than those kinds of other economic policy steps that are being taken. It‚Äôs creating uncertainty for businesses,‚Äù Zandi added. One sector that will be immediately impacted by the tariffs on Canada and Mexico is the automotive industry. Major players in the sector have slammed the president‚Äôs plans in recent weeks, including Ford CEO Jim Farley who said that the tariffs would ‚Äúblow a hole‚Äù in the automotive industry. Other major players across the manufacturing sector also expect this to get worse. William Oplinger, CEO of Alcoa, one of the largest US aluminium manufacturers, said last month at a conference that the aluminium tariffs could cost the US economy 100,000 jobs. ‚ÄúIt does look increasingly like the president is serious and is going to engage in broad-based tariffs in a persistent way. If he does, I do expect other countries to retaliate more or less in kind, and that full-blown trade war is going to do a lot of damage. And if it actually goes down that path, I do think recession risks later in the year, later this spring and summer, are very high,‚Äù Zandi continued. Trump has claimed a handful of economic wins in his first weeks in office, including a larger investment from Honda to build more plants, which would ultimately lead to more manufacturing jobs. However, production would not come online until May 2028 ‚Äì less than a year before Trump‚Äôs term is up. Japanese truck maker Isuzu also announced a new plant in South Carolina, which will employ 700 people. But it will begin operations in 2027. Trump also touted a deal with TSMC ‚Äì a Taiwanese semiconductor chip manufacturer ‚Äì for a $100bn investment. Negotiations for a deal began well before Trump took office and under the Biden Administration, which pushed the chip maker to increase its initial $6.6bn investment. In February, the Trump Administration touted Apple‚Äôs recent $500bn investment commitment as a result of Trump‚Äôs policies. In April 2021, when Biden was president, Apple made a comparable commitment. The White House did not respond to Al Jazeera‚Äôs request for clarification. Follow Al Jazeera English:

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, March 11, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (‚ÄúAppLovin‚Äù or the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin‚Äôs financial growth and stability. Defendants‚Äô statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin‚Äôs launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using ‚Äúcutting-edge AI technologies‚Äù to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures.

Title: The stakes are high for Tesla

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London while Dan is on parental leave until May. Do you have a bad boss? From the narcissist to the micromanager, experts outlined four types of poor leaders ‚Äî and shared tips with BI on how to work with each one. In today's big story, with Tesla's stock cut in half, investors want their CEO back. What's on deck Markets: The stock market has a $1 trillion weapon to fight further price declines: stock buybacks. Tech: An Amazon VP who oversaw the company's flagship AI product is leaving. Business: Target's ideological identity crisis is putting its business in peril. But first, Elon Musk seems a little distracted. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The damage is stunning, BI's Matthew Fox writes. Tesla's stock price has plummeted 55% from its mid-December highs, Elon Musk's net worth is down $132 billion this year, and a wave of anti-Tesla vandalism has intensified from graffiti to gunshots and Molotov cocktails; images show the aftermath of a Tesla showroom that was recently shot up after hours. While this has been unfolding, Musk has been in Washington, DC, overseeing DOGE's cost-cutting government overhaul ‚Äî and Tesla investors aren't thrilled about it. "We think shareholders have legitimate concerns about Elon Musk being spread too thin," one analyst told BI. "It's become clear he's now spending more time on DOGE than anything else." Musk himself appears to have acknowledged this precarious balancing act. During an interview that aired just yesterday, Musk was asked by Fox Business how he's running his other businesses while also working closely with the White House. His response? "With great difficulty." Needless to say, Musk's answer is unlikely to calm investors' nerves. Especially when yesterday alone saw Tesla's stock plunge 15%, its largest single-day drop since 2020. Tesla no longer seems to be part of the so-called Musk trade, with all of its postelection gains now erased. The company's EV sales have been struggling, BI's Jennifer Sor writes. Car sales plummeted in several countries last month, and Wall Street is juggling concerns about Tesla's Full Self-Driving software. Meanwhile, the competition in China is growing stronger. There now may be more riding on Tesla's long-promised cheaper EV, which is supposed to begin production in June at the latest. With Tesla's stock facing choppy waters, analysts told BI the launch was "crucial" and a "necessity." Musk needs to turn more people into Tesla customers. But since he's been in Washington, he's turned some people off the company entirely. An angel investor told BI she's among the cohort of Americans ditching their Teslas over Musk's DOGE initiative. At the same time, "Tesla takedown" protests have sprung up in cities across the US, and some Tesla owners have seen their vehicles vandalized ‚Äî you can take a closer look here. Meanwhile, one business is booming amid Tesla's woes: An aquarium worker who sells anti-Elon Musk stickers online as a side hustle told BI he had been selling 400 to 500 stickers a day in recent weeks ‚Äî up from a handful in the past. The stakes are high for the company at the moment, but as Investing.com's Thomas Monteiro told BI: "Tesla has a history of delivering when the odds are stacked against it." 1. The Magnificent 7's terrible, horrible, no-good, very bad day. All seven tech darlings ‚Äî Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft ‚Äî slid deeper into the red Monday, dragging the Nasdaq 100 down 3.8% in its biggest decline since October 2022. The amount of market value wiped out in the index exceeded $1 trillion at lows. The S&P 500, fresh off its worst week in six months thanks to tariff-related uncertainty, lost another 2.7%. 2. The stock market's secret weapon to fighting further price declines. As the stock market struggles, Citi analysts noted it could be a great time for companies to buy back their stock at discounted levels ‚Äî which has historically been an ace in the hole for companies looking to engineer stock gains during lean times. The bank is already expecting more repurchase activity, forecasting $1 trillion in 2025, up 11% from the previous year. 3. Nvidia's sliding stock is currently cheaper than when ChatGPT launched ‚Äî at least by one metric. Following Monday's market wipeout, the chip giant's P/E ratio dropped to 36.4 times, the lowest since 2019, and is down 30% from its intraday record high. 1. The godfather of DOGE. Behind President Trump's first month back in office lies a sweeping political vision set by tech billionaire Peter Thiel. In a 2009 essay for the Cato Institute, Thiel argued for the end of all government ‚Äî even democracy ‚Äî and for tech entrepreneurs to steer the future. From gutting government agencies to putting a stop to diversity, Trump and his followers are now putting Thiel's vision into practice. 2. Zuck's favorite president. Mark Zuckerberg told an employee in 2014 he thought Andrew Jackson was the greatest US president. The Meta CEO said he admired Jackson for his ruthlessness, and being a populist who "got stuff done," former Facebook executive Sarah Wynn-Williams, wrote in her recently published memoir, "Careless People." 3. The Amazon VP in charge of its flagship AI product is out. Baskar Sridharan, AWS's VP of AI/ML services, is stepping down a year after joining the company following a major reorg, according to people familiar with the matter. Sridharan oversaw the direction and development of AWS's major AI products, including its main horse in the AI race, Bedrock. 1. How Target went from woke to joke. Target can't figure out what it stands for, particularly when it comes to diversity. That's a bad position for a brand with cultural relevancy baked into the business model. The result is a stock price down 30% this year and an unenviable place at the center of America's culture wars. 2. The Washington Post faces another newsroom shake-up. In an effort to sharpen the Post's mission and cater to new readers' evolving habits, executive editor Matt Murray detailed a substantial newsroom reorganization on Monday. The changes, which include several new leadership roles and reorganized teams, come after owner Jeff Bezos overhauled the paper's opinion pages last month. Read the memo Murray sent to WaPo staff. 3. Jamie Dimon knows who the biggest proponent of remote work is. When it comes to RTO, the JPMorgan Chase CEO said it's often the "people in the middle who complain a lot about it." That is, white-collar workers who generally have more freedom when it comes to where they work than frontline workers. Dimon, a longtime advocate for RTO, recently spoke at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he discussed his own bank's plans to go in-person.

Title: Stock market selloff: Is a US recession ahead?

When Donald Trump was reelected in November, many investors declared the so-called Trump Trade would spur US stocks to new highs. But markets are now spooked by fears the world's largest economy is close to recession. Many investors believed Donald Trump's return to the White House as the United States' president would be a bonanza for the US stock market, which had already hit all-time highs in recent months thanks to the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. They argued that the dealmaking, "America First" president would be sensitive to any uncertainty in financial markets caused by his tariff policy and would likely intervene, if necessary, to help stabilize prices. But after weeks of uncertainty about Trump's protectionist measures, on Monday US stocks fell sharply, against the backdrop of fears that the world's largest economy could tip into recession later this year. The Dow dropped almost 900 points, the S&P 500 fell 2.7%, while the Nasdaq toppled 4% ‚Äî its steepest fall in two-and-a-half years. Tesla plummeted by 15%, while the Magnificent 7 stocks ‚Äî Apple, Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta and Tesla ‚Äî collectively entered bear market territory. Deutsche Bank noted how these stocks have shed more than 20% of their value since December. Bloomberg reported that the combined wealth of the five billionaires who attended Trump's inauguration has been slashed by $209 billion (‚Ç¨191 billion) since January 20. Tesla CEO Elon Musk alone has lost $144 billion. Markets appeared to be reacting to comments made by the president over the weekend, playing down the impact of his on-off tariff threats to Canada, Mexico and other major trading partners. The Republican also appeared dismissive about the impact his negotiating strategy was having on stocks. "There could be a little disruption [to financial markets]," Trump told Fox News on Sunday. "What I have to do is build a strong country. You can‚Äôt really watch the stock market." "President Trump seems to have abandoned the US stock market and is willing to put his political vision above the near-term outlook for the US economy," Kathleen Brooks, research director at trading platform XTB, wrote in a research note Monday, following the market rout. Citi, meanwhile, downgraded US stocks to "neutral" from "overweight" after the market closed, warning that the investment bank now thinks US growth momentum will "undershoot" the rest of the world. British banking giant HSBC also cut US equities to neutral for the next three to six months, saying the lender sees "better opportunities elsewhere for now." US policymakers have spent the past year trying to avoid plunging the economy into recession. Interest rates have fallen from their recent peak of 5.33%, which helped reduce inflation from its recent multi-decade highs. But Trump's various tariff policies threaten to disrupt efforts to achieve a soft landing. New 25% levies on all steel and aluminum imports into the US are due to take effect Wednesday, while new tariffs on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that: "The prospect of a recession in the US is lurking, with consumer confidence falling, companies facing increasing trade complexity and investors turning more nervous." In addition, the vast public sector cuts led by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk also threaten to weaken growth, as they will take jobs and investment out of the economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week a period of "natural adjustment" as the US moved from higher spending by the public to the private sector. "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We‚Äôve become addicted to this government spending, and there‚Äôs going to be a detox period," Bessent told CNBC Friday, adding that a "one-time price adjustment" was to be expected from Trump's tariff policy. Also looming over the US economy is the threat of a partial shutdown of the federal government, if new funding can't be finalized before a Friday deadline. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives is due to vote Tuesday on legislation that would keep the government fully financed. The last government shutdown stretched over 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first term. Goldman Sachs cut its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy to just 1.7%, down from 2.4%. The US investment bank also raised its inflation forecast to 3% from a prior call in the mid-2% range. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Goldman analyst Jan Hatzius wrote. In the meantime, the Trump administration insists that a new round of tax cuts and revenues from tariffs on imports will help boost the economy. White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

Citi, meanwhile, downgraded US stocks to "neutral" from "overweight" after the market closed, warning that the investment bank now thinks US growth momentum will "undershoot" the rest of the world. British banking giant HSBC also cut US equities to neutral for the next three to six months, saying the lender sees "better opportunities elsewhere for now." US policymakers have spent the past year trying to avoid plunging the economy into recession. Interest rates have fallen from their recent peak of 5.33%, which helped reduce inflation from its recent multi-decade highs. But Trump's various tariff policies threaten to disrupt efforts to achieve a soft landing. New 25% levies on all steel and aluminum imports into the US are due to take effect Wednesday, while new tariffs on Chinese goods have doubled to 20%. Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown warned that: "The prospect of a recession in the US is lurking, with consumer confidence falling, companies facing increasing trade complexity and investors turning more nervous." In addition, the vast public sector cuts led by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) under Musk also threaten to weaken growth, as they will take jobs and investment out of the economy. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged last week a period of "natural adjustment" as the US moved from higher spending by the public to the private sector. "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We‚Äôve become addicted to this government spending, and there‚Äôs going to be a detox period," Bessent told CNBC Friday, adding that a "one-time price adjustment" was to be expected from Trump's tariff policy. Also looming over the US economy is the threat of a partial shutdown of the federal government, if new funding can't be finalized before a Friday deadline. The Republican-controlled US House of Representatives is due to vote Tuesday on legislation that would keep the government fully financed. The last government shutdown stretched over 35 days in late 2018 and early 2019, during Trump's first term. Goldman Sachs cut its 2025 growth forecast for the US economy to just 1.7%, down from 2.4%. The US investment bank also raised its inflation forecast to 3% from a prior call in the mid-2% range. "The reason for the downgrade is that our trade policy assumptions have become considerably more adverse," Goldman analyst Jan Hatzius wrote. In the meantime, the Trump administration insists that a new round of tax cuts and revenues from tariffs on imports will help boost the economy. White House spokesperson Kush Desai wrote in a statement Monday that industry leaders have responded to Trump's second term "with trillions in investment commitments." "President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term," Desai added.

DeepSeek√¢¬Ä¬ôs Real Impact On May 8, O√¢¬Ä¬ôReilly Media will be hosting Coding with AI: The End of Software Development as We Know It√¢¬Ä¬îa live virtual tech conference spotlighting how AI is already supercharging developers, boosting productivity, and providing real value to their organizations. If you√¢¬Ä¬ôre in the trenches building tomorrow√¢¬Ä¬ôs development practices today and interested in speaking at the event, we√¢¬Ä¬ôd love to hear from you by March 12. You can find more information and our call for presentations here. Just want to attend? Register for free here. A few weeks ago, DeepSeek shocked the AI world by releasing DeepSeek-R1, a reasoning model with performance on a par with OpenAI‚Äôs o1 and GPT-4o models. The surprise wasn√¢¬Ä¬ôt so much that DeepSeek managed to build a good model√¢¬Ä¬îalthough, at least in the United States, many technologists haven√¢¬Ä¬ôt taken seriously the abilities of China√¢¬Ä¬ôs technology sector√¢¬Ä¬îbut that the estimate that the training cost for R1 was only about $5 million. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs roughly 1/10th what it cost to train OpenAI√¢¬Ä¬ôs most recent models. Furthermore, the cost of inference√¢¬Ä¬îusing the model√¢¬Ä¬îis roughly 1/27th the cost of using OpenAI.1 That was enough to shock the stock market in the US, taking nearly $600 million from GPU chipmaker NVIDIA‚Äôs valuation. Join the O'Reilly online learning platform. Get a free trial today and find answers on the fly, or master something new and useful. DeepSeek√¢¬Ä¬ôs licensing was surprisingly open, and that also sent shock waves through the industry: The source code and weights are under the permissive MIT License, and the developers have published a reasonably thorough paper about how the model was trained. As far as I know, this is unique among reasoning models (specifically, OpenAI√¢¬Ä¬ôs o3, Gemini 2.0, Claude 3.7, and Alibaba√¢¬Ä¬ôs QwQ). While the meaning of √¢¬Ä¬úopen√¢¬Ä¬ù for AI is under debate (for example, QwQ claims to be √¢¬Ä¬úopen,√¢¬Ä¬ù but Alibaba has only released relatively small parts of the model), R1 can be modified, specialized, hosted on other platforms, and built into other systems. R1√¢¬Ä¬ôs release has provoked a blizzard of arguments and discussions. Did DeepSeek report its costs accurately? I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to find out that DeepSeek√¢¬Ä¬ôs low inference cost was subsidized by the Chinese government. Did DeepSeek √¢¬Ä¬ústeal√¢¬Ä¬ù training data from OpenAI? Maybe; Sam Altman has said that OpenAI won√¢¬Ä¬ôt sue DeepSeek for violating its terms of service. Altman certainly knows the PR value of hinting at √¢¬Ä¬útheft,√¢¬Ä¬ù but he also knows that law and PR aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt the same. A legal argument would be difficult, given that OpenAI√¢¬Ä¬ôs terms of service state, √¢¬Ä¬úAs between you and OpenAI, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain all ownership rights in Input and (b) own all Output. We hereby assign to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to Output.√¢¬Ä¬ù Finally, the most important question: Open source software enabled the vast software ecosystem that we now enjoy; will open AI lead to an flourishing AI ecosystem, or will it still be possible for a single vendor (or nation) to dominate? Will we have open AI or OpenAI? That√¢¬Ä¬ôs the question we really need to answer. Meta√¢¬Ä¬ôs Llama models have already done much to open up the AI ecosystem. Is AI now √¢¬Ä¬úout of the (proprietary) box,√¢¬Ä¬ù permanently and irrevocably? DeepSeek isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt the only organization challenging our ideas about AI. We√¢¬Ä¬ôre already seeing new models that were built on R1√¢¬Ä¬îand they were even less expensive to train. Since DeepSeek√¢¬Ä¬ôs announcement, a research group at Berkeley released Sky-T1-32B-Preview, a small reasoning model that cost under $450 to train. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs based on Alibaba√¢¬Ä¬ôs Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct. Even more recently, a group of researchers released s1, a 32B reasoning model that, according to one estimate, cost only $6 to train. The developers of s1 employed a neat trick: Rather than using a large training set consisting of reasoning samples, they carefully pruned the set down to 1,000 samples and forced s1 to spend more time on each example. Pruning the training set no doubt required a lot of human work√¢¬Ä¬îand none of these estimates include the cost of human labor√¢¬Ä¬îbut it suggests that the cost of training useful models is coming down, way down. Other reports claim similarly low costs for training reasoning models. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs the point: What happens when the cost of training AI goes to near-zero? What happens when AI developers aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt beholden to a small number of well-funded companies spending tens or hundreds of millions training proprietary models? Furthermore, running a 32B model is well within the capabilities of a reasonably well-equipped laptop. It will spin your fans; it will be slow (minutes rather than seconds); and you√¢¬Ä¬ôll probably need 64 GB of RAM√¢¬Ä¬îbut it will work. The same model will run in the cloud at a reasonable cost without specialized servers. These smaller √¢¬Ä¬údistilled√¢¬Ä¬ù models can run on off-the-shelf hardware without expensive GPUs. And they can do useful work, particularly if fine-tuned for a specific application domain. Spending a little money on high-end hardware will bring response times down to the point where building and hosting custom models becomes a realistic option. The biggest bottleneck will be expertise. We√¢¬Ä¬ôre on the cusp of a new generation of reasoning models that are inexpensive to train and operate. DeepSeek and similar models have commoditized AI, and that has big implications. I√¢¬Ä¬ôve long suspected that OpenAI and the other major players have been playing an economic game. On one end of the market, they are pushing up the cost of training to keep other players from entering the market. Nothing is more discouraging than the idea that it will take tens of millions of dollars to train a model and billions of dollars to build the infrastructure necessary to operate it. On the other end, charges for using the service (inference) appear to be so low that it looks like classic √¢¬Ä¬úblitzscaling√¢¬Ä¬ù: offering services below cost to buy the market, then raising prices once the competitors have been driven out. (Yes, it√¢¬Ä¬ôs naive, but I think we all look at $60/million tokens and say, √¢¬Ä¬úThat√¢¬Ä¬ôs nothing.√¢¬Ä¬ù) We√¢¬Ä¬ôve seen this model with services like Uber. And while we know little that√¢¬Ä¬ôs concrete about OpenAI√¢¬Ä¬ôs finances, everything we√¢¬Ä¬ôve seen suggests that they√¢¬Ä¬ôre far from profitable2√¢¬Ä¬îa clear sign of blitzscaling. And if competitors can offer inference at a fraction of OpenAI√¢¬Ä¬ôs price, raising prices to profitable levels will be impossible. What about computing infrastructure? The US is proposing investing $500B in data centers for artificial intelligence, an amount that some commentators have compared to the US√¢¬Ä¬ôs investment in the interstate highway system. Is more computing power necessary? I don√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to rush to the conclusion that it isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt necessary or advisable. But that√¢¬Ä¬ôs a question complicated by the existence of low-cost training and inference. If the cost of building models goes down drastically, more organizations will build models; if the cost of inference goes down drastically, and that drop is reflected in consumer pricing, more people will use AI. The net result might be an increase in training and inference. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs Jevons paradox. A reduction in the cost of a commodity may cause an increase in use large enough to increase the resources needed to produce the commodity. It√¢¬Ä¬ôs not really a paradox when you think about it. Jevons paradox has a big impact on what kind of data infrastructure is needed to support the growing AI industry. The best approach to building out data center technology necessarily depends on how those data centers are used. Are they supporting a small number of wealthy companies in Silicon Valley? Or are they open to a new army of software developers and software users? Are they a billionaire√¢¬Ä¬ôs toy for achieving science fiction√¢¬Ä¬ôs goal of human-level intelligence? Or are they designed to enable practical work that√¢¬Ä¬ôs highly distributed, both geographically and technologically? The data centers you build so that a small number of companies can allocate millions of A100 GPUs are going to be different from the data centers you build to facilitate thousands of companies serving AI applications to millions of individual users. I fear that OpenAI, Oracle, and the US government want to build the former, when we really need more of the latter. Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is well understood and widely accepted by enterprise IT groups. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and many smaller competitors offer hosting for AI applications. All of these√¢¬Ä¬îand other cloud providers√¢¬Ä¬îare planning to expand their capacity in anticipation of AI workloads. Before making a massive investment in data centers, we also need to think about opportunity cost. What else could be done with half a trillion dollars? What other opportunities will we miss because of this investment? And when will the investment pay off? These are questions we don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know how to answer yet√¢¬Ä¬îand probably won√¢¬Ä¬ôt until we√¢¬Ä¬ôre several years into the project. Whatever answers we may guess right now are made problematic by the possibility that scaling to bigger compute clusters is the wrong approach. Although it√¢¬Ä¬ôs counterintuitive, there are good reasons to believe that training a model in logic should be easier than training it in human language. As more research groups succeed in training models quickly, and at low cost, we have to wonder whether data centers designed for inference rather than training would be a better investment. And these are not the same. If our needs for reasoning AI can be satisfied by models that can be trained for a few million dollars√¢¬Ä¬îand possibly much less√¢¬Ä¬îthen grand plans for general superhuman artificial intelligence are headed in the wrong direction and will cause us to miss opportunities to build the infrastructure that√¢¬Ä¬ôs really needed for widely available inference. The infrastructure that√¢¬Ä¬ôs needed will allow us to build a future that√¢¬Ä¬ôs more evenly distributed (with apologies to William Gibson). A future that includes smart devices, many of which will have intermittent connectivity or no connectivity, and applications that we are only beginning to imagine. This is disruption√¢¬Ä¬îno doubt disruption that√¢¬Ä¬ôs unevenly distributed (for the time being), but that√¢¬Ä¬ôs the nature of disruption. This disruption undoubtedly means that we√¢¬Ä¬ôll see AI used more widely, both by new startups and established companies. Invencion√¢¬Ä¬ôs Off Kilter. blog points to a new generation of √¢¬Ä¬úgarage AI√¢¬Ä¬ù startups, startups that aren√¢¬Ä¬ôt dependent on eye-watering infusions of cash from venture capitalists. When AI becomes a commodity, it decouples real innovation from capital. Innovation can return to its roots as making something new, not spending lots of money. It can be about building sustainable businesses around human value rather than monetizing attention and √¢¬Ä¬úengagement√¢¬Ä¬ù√¢¬Ä¬îa process that, we√¢¬Ä¬ôve seen, inevitably results in enshittification√¢¬Ä¬îwhich inherently requires Meta-like scale. It allows AI√¢¬Ä¬ôs value to diffuse throughout society rather than remaining √¢¬Ä¬úalready here√¢¬Ä¬¶just not unevenly distributed yet.√¢¬Ä¬ù The authors of Off Kilter. write: You will not beat an anti-human Big Tech monopolist by you, too, being anti-human, for you do not have its power. Instead, you will win by being its opposite, its alternative. Where it seeks to force, you must seduce. Thus, the GarageAI firm of the future must be relentlessly pro-human in all facets, from its management style to its product experience and approach to market, if it is to succeed. What does √¢¬Ä¬úrelentlessly pro-human√¢¬Ä¬ù mean? We can start by thinking about the goal of √¢¬Ä¬úgeneral intelligence.√¢¬Ä¬ù I√¢¬Ä¬ôve argued that none of the advances in AI have taught us what intelligence is√¢¬Ä¬îthey‚Äôve helped us understand what intelligence is not. Back in the 1990s, when Deep Blue beat chess champion Garry Kasparov, we learned that chess isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt a proxy for intelligence. Chess is something that intelligent people can do, but the ability to play chess isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt a measure of intelligence. We learned the same thing when AlphaGo beat Lee Sedol√¢¬Ä¬îupping the ante by playing a game with even more imposing combinatorics doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt fundamentally change anything. Nor does the use of reinforcement learning to train the model rather than a rule-based approach. What distinguishes humans from machines√¢¬Ä¬îat least in 2025√¢¬Ä¬îis that humans can want to do something. Machines can√¢¬Ä¬ôt. AlphaGo doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to play Go. Your favorite code generation engine doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to write software, nor does it feel any reward from writing software successfully. Humans want to be creative; that√¢¬Ä¬ôs where human intelligence is grounded. Or, as William Butler Yeats wrote, √¢¬Ä¬úI must lie down where all the ladders start / In the foul rag and bone shop of the heart.√¢¬Ä¬ù You may not want to be there, but that√¢¬Ä¬ôs where creation starts√¢¬Ä¬îand creation is the reward. That√¢¬Ä¬ôs why I√¢¬Ä¬ôm dismayed when I see someone like Mikey Shulman, founder of Suno (an AI-based music synthesis company), say, √¢¬Ä¬úIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs not really enjoyable to make music now. . . .It takes a lot of time, it takes a lot of practice, you need to get really good at an instrument or really good at a piece of production software. I think the majority of people don√¢¬Ä¬ôt enjoy the majority of the time they spend making music.√¢¬Ä¬ù Don√¢¬Ä¬ôt get me wrong√¢¬Ä¬îSuno√¢¬Ä¬ôs product is impressive, and I√¢¬Ä¬ôm not easily impressed by attempts at music synthesis. But anyone who can say that people don√¢¬Ä¬ôt enjoy making music or learning to play instruments has never talked to a musician. Nor have they appreciated the fact that, if people really didn√¢¬Ä¬ôt want to play music, professional musicians would be much better paid. We wouldn√¢¬Ä¬ôt have to say, √¢¬Ä¬úDon√¢¬Ä¬ôt quit the day job,√¢¬Ä¬ù or be paid $60 for an hour-long gig that requires two hours of driving and untold hours of preparation. The reason musicians are paid so poorly, aside from a few superstars, is that too many people want the job. The same is true for actors, painters, sculptors, novelists, poets√¢¬Ä¬îany creative occupation. Why does Suno want to play in this market? Because they think they can grab a share of the commoditized music market with noncommoditized (expensive) AI, with the expense of model development providing a √¢¬Ä¬úmoat√¢¬Ä¬ù that deters competition. Two years ago, a leaked Google document questioned whether a moat was possible for any company whose business model relied on scaling language models to even greater sizes. We√¢¬Ä¬ôre seeing that play out now: The deep meaning of DeepSeek is that the moat represented by scaling is disappearing. The real question for √¢¬Ä¬úrelentlessly pro-human√¢¬Ä¬ù AI is: What kinds of AI aid human creativity? The market for tools to help musicians create is relatively small, but it exists; plenty of musicians pay for software like Finale to help write scores. Deep Blue may not want to play chess, but its success spawned many products that people use to train themselves to play better. If AI is a relatively inexpensive commodity, the size of the market doesn√¢¬Ä¬ôt matter; specialized products that assist humans in small markets become economically feasible. AI-assisted programming is now widely practiced, and can give us another look at what √¢¬Ä¬úrelentlessly human√¢¬Ä¬ù might mean. Most software developers get their start because they enjoy the creativity: They like programming; they like making a machine do what they want it to do. With that in mind, the real metric for coding assistants isn√¢¬Ä¬ôt the lines of code that they produce; it√¢¬Ä¬ôs whether programming becomes more enjoyable and the products that software developers build become more usable. Taking the fun part of the job away while leaving software developers stuck with debugging and testing is a disincentive. We won√¢¬Ä¬ôt have to worry about programmers losing their jobs; they won√¢¬Ä¬ôt want their jobs if the creativity disappears. (We will have to worry about who will perform the drudgery of debugging if we have a shortage of well-trained software developers.) But helping developers reason about the human process they are trying to model so they can do a better job of understanding the problems they need to solve√¢¬Ä¬îthat√¢¬Ä¬ôs pro-human. As is eliminating the dull, boring parts that go with every job: writing boilerplate code, learning how to use libraries you will probably never need again, writing musical scores with paper and pen. The goal is to enable human creativity, not to limit or eliminate it. The goal is collaboration rather than domination. Right now, we√¢¬Ä¬ôre at an inflection point, a point of disruption. What comes next? What (to quote Yeats again) is √¢¬Ä¬úslouching towards Bethlehem√¢¬Ä¬ù? We don√¢¬Ä¬ôt know, but there are some conclusions that we can√¢¬Ä¬ôt avoid: While there are many challenges to overcome√¢¬Ä¬îlatency being the greatest of them√¢¬Ä¬îsmall models that can be embedded in other systems will, in the long run, be more useful than massive foundation/frontier models. The big question, then, is how these models will be used. What happens when AI diffuses through society? Will we finally get √¢¬Ä¬úrelentlessly human√¢¬Ä¬ù applications that enrich our lives, that enable us to be more creative? Or will we become further enmeshed in a war for our attention (and productivity) that quashes creativity by offering endless shortcuts? We√¢¬Ä¬ôre about to find out.

Elon Musk told Fox Business in an interview that aired Monday he was running his various businesses ‚Äúwith great difficulty,‚Äù making the statement as Tesla shares fell to a five-month low and while he spends time as a key figurehead in the Trump administration‚Äôs Department of Government Efficiency. Musk made the statement in an interview with Fox Business. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) Fox Business‚Äô Larry Kudlow asked Musk in an interview how he is running his other businesses while simultaneously dedicating time to politics and DOGE, to which Musk replied, ‚ÄúWith great difficulty,‚Äù before taking a long pause and sighing. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs no turning back, you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù Kudlow then asked, drawing another pause from Musk, who then said he is ‚Äújust here trying to make government more efficient, eliminate waste and fraud and so far we‚Äôre making good progress.‚Äù Musk did not provide specifics on how he is running businesses he serves as CEO of, like SpaceX, xAI and Tesla, the latter company of which traded down over 15% on Monday, sending shares to a low not seen since Oct. 23. Musk, who said in a Monday tweet Tesla would ‚Äúbe fine long-term,‚Äù experienced a $22.8 billion drop in his estimated net worth down to $319.6 billion Monday, though he is still by far the wealthiest person in the world, exceeding the estimated net worths of the next wealthiest people: Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos ($210.8 billion) and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($206.7 billion).

Brad Lander, New York City‚Äôs comptroller, oversees employee pension funds that own $1.25 billion worth of Tesla shares, according to The New York Times, which was told by Lander, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt have a C.E.O. who is fully focused on ensuring that Tesla remains a leader in the E.V. space.‚Äù Lander also told the Times he wanted Musk to pass his CEO duties to a full-time employee. Musk has become a key White House figure since President Donald Trump began his term in January, attending press briefings alongside Trump and a Cabinet meeting last month and describing his role in government as ‚Äútech support.‚Äù The billionaire consistently tweets and talks about the work of DOGE, a government agency he unofficially heads that has pushed for government spending cuts and layoffs. Concerns about Musk‚Äôs time for the companies he heads or has co-founded were also made public when the billionaire took over Twitter, now known as X, for $44 billion in 2022. Some Tesla investors even pushed Musk to exit the deal for the social media platform as the value of the electric vehicle company was slashed by about 30% after the acquisition was initiated.
